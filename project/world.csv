‘Greater risk’: Covid-19 mask mandate returns to California county; aims to protect ‘most vulnerable population’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/greater-risk-covid-19-mask-mandate-returns-to-california-county-aims-to-protect-most-vulnerable-population/articleshow/124402912.cms,"representative AI image





A California wine country county is strengthening its vaccine recommendations and implementing a mask mandate, citing a “greater risk” of Covid-19 as the annual flu season begins.Karen Smith, interim health officer for the Sonoma County Department of Public Health, issued an order on Monday mandating masks for anyone entering specified healthcare facilities in the county.The mask mandate, effective from November 1 to March 31, 2026, allows Smith to expand the facilities covered as needed and will be implemented annually unless officially lifted.""The rationale behind this order is to protect the most vulnerable populations (such as the elderly and cancer patients) and to try to prevent medical staff from getting sick and creating staffing problems for facilities,"" a spokesperson for the Sonoma County department of health was quoted as saying by Fox News.The order includes several exemptions, covering anyone ""with a diagnosed medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents the individual from wearing a face mask.""It also exempts hearing-impaired individuals who need to see the mouth to communicate, as well as anyone else whom local, state, or federal regulators determine could be harmed by wearing a mask.The order specifies the types of masks that are acceptable, including surgical masks, KN95, KF94, or N95 respirators.Informal coverings such as scarves, ski masks, balaclavas, bandanas, turtlenecks, collars, cloth masks, or any mask with an unfiltered one-way exhaust valve do not meet the requirements.Alongside the mask mandate, Smith issued stronger guidance on Covid-19 and flu vaccinations, strongly recommending shots for everyone aged six months and older. She also advised that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals wear masks in indoor public spaces when Covid-19 or influenza risk is high.Smith’s vaccine and mask recommendations, particularly those aimed at protecting older populations, conflict with guidance from Robert F Kennedy Jr’s department of health and human services (HHS).California enforced a strict mask mandate during the Covid-19 pandemic, requiring face coverings in most public settings statewide from June 2020 to June 2021, as cited by the Daily Mail.Between December 2021 and February 2022, the state reinstated indoor mask mandates in response to a surge in Covid cases and hospitalizations, while several counties implemented even stricter masking policies.","Sonoma County issued an order on Monday mandating masks for anyone entering specified healthcare facilities in the county.

'Strange cure attempt': 82-year-old Chinese woman swallows 8 live frogs for back pain; here is what happened next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/strange-cure-attempt-82-year-old-chinese-woman-swallows-8-live-frogs-for-back-pain-here-is-what-happened-next/articleshow/124402885.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)





An 82-year-old woman in eastern China has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain, following a local folk remedy.The woman, identified only by her surname Zhang, was admitted to a hospital in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in early September after suffering from severe abdominal pain, South China Morning Post reported citing Hangzhou Daily.“My mother ate eight live frogs. Now the sharp pain has made her unable to walk,” her son told doctors.Zhang had long been suffering from a herniated disc and believed that consuming live frogs could ease her pain. Without explaining her plan, she asked her family to catch some frogs for her.Once they did, Zhang swallowed three frogs on the first day and five the next, all smaller than the size of an adult’s palm.She initially experienced mild discomfort, but the pain worsened over the next few days. Only then did she confess to her family what she had done.Doctors at Zhejiang University No 1 Affiliated Hospital examined Zhang and ruled out the presence of a tumour.However, they discovered a high number of oxyphil cells, an indicator of potential parasitic infections or blood disorders. Further tests confirmed that Zhang had indeed contracted parasites.“Swallowing frogs has damaged the patient’s digestive system and resulted in some parasites being present in her body, including sparganum,” a hospital doctor said.Zhang was discharged after two weeks of treatment.Dr Wu Zhongwen, a senior physician at the same hospital, said similar cases are not uncommon.“We have received several similar patients in recent years. Besides swallowing frogs, some individuals consume raw snake gall or fish gall, or apply frog skin to their own skin,” he said.He explained that most of these patients are elderly and often avoid discussing their health problems with their families. They typically seek medical help only when their condition becomes serious.“For instance, putting frog skin on one’s body is rumoured to treat skin diseases. However, there is no evidence to support this remedy. On the contrary, it could allow parasites to enter the body, resulting in vision impairment, intracranial infection, and even life-threatening conditions,” Wu added.In one recent case from the same province, a six-month-old baby girl developed lead poisoning after her mother used an online “remedy” for eczema by soaking her hand in a lead acetate solution.The lead residue then transferred to the baby’s skin, doctors said.","An 82-year-old woman in eastern China has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain.

On the night of October 7, 2025, the UAE will witness a rare and brilliant celestial display — the Hunter Supermoon. Appearing 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual, this astronomical event offers a unique stargazing opportunity. Whether you're heading to the desert, mountains, or a beach, the UAE has a wide range of prime viewing locations, from expert-led events to serene natural spots — all promising a clear, awe-inspiring sight of the moon in its closest orbit to Earth.The Hunter Supermoon, also known as the Hunter’s Moon, traditionally signals the time of year when hunters prepared for winter by gathering game under the bright moonlight. Though its name has historical roots, the modern spectacle lies in its astronomical significance.This year’s Hunter Moon becomes a supermoon — a term used when a full moon occurs at perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit. As a result, on October 7, the moon will appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it's at its farthest point. This visual amplification makes it particularly stunning for viewers across the UAE and beyond.This supermoon is the first of three expected in the current season, making it a key date on the calendar for skywatchers.For those seeking a more immersive experience, the Dubai Astronomy Group is organising a public moon-viewing session on Tuesday, October 7, at Al Awir Second Park from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. The event will include expert explanations and access to telescopes for enhanced viewing.Those unable to attend the official viewing still have plenty of accessible public spots across the UAE to enjoy the event.Located away from urban light pollution, this 24-hour desert location is ideal for moongazing. A 4×4 vehicle is recommended, and designated barbecue areas offer a chance to combine stargazing with a meal. For those wanting fast food, Last Exit Al Qudra is just a 9-minute drive away.Just under two hours from Dubai, Hatta offers scenic mountain views and opportunities for overnight camping. Light pollution exists closer to the town, but deeper into the Hajar Mountains, the skies are clearer for a better viewing experience.Open 24 hours, this coastal location provides a quiet, open space for moon-watching. Visitors can either picnic on the beach or watch from parked cars with air conditioning.This 70-metre-long pedestrian bridge offers panoramic views of the Burj Khalifa, Downtown Dubai, and the creek — creating a striking urban contrast to the natural wonder above. While picnicking isn’t allowed on the bridge itself, nearby benches and restaurants offer comfort and refreshments. Open 24 hours.Al Quaa Milky Way Spot (Abu Dhabi)Approximately 90 minutes from Abu Dhabi towards Al Ain, this is one of the darkest and clearest locations for sky observation. Ideal for more serious stargazers, it requires a 4×4 vehicle and some experience with desert driving.Sharjah Centre for Astronomy and Space SciencesLocated in Sharjah, this facility blends astronomy education with observation. While it has a dedicated observatory and is suitable for public events, availability depends on their schedule, so prior checking is recommended.Jebel Jais, Ras Al KhaimahAs the highest peak in the UAE, Jebel Jais offers an unobstructed and pollution-free sky, perfect for viewing celestial events like the Supermoon.

If you’re in Dubai this October, get ready to catch one of the city’s biggest Diwali celebrations yet. Fireworks will be lighting up the skies at key spots, alongside a range of cultural events. It’s a perfect chance to experience how Dubai blends tradition and celebration for the Festival of Lights.Running from October 17 to 25, Dubai’s expanded Diwali fireworks celebrations will light up iconic locations like Al Seef and Global Village.

Located along the banks of Dubai Creek, this historic waterfront destination offers a unique Diwali experience, pairing views of traditional wooden dhows and restored souks with modern cafés and boutiques.Organisers recommend arriving early — the show is free to attend, but expect large crowds drawn to the charming, old-world setting.The celebration continues at Global Village, which hosts four additional shows over two weekends. Each display begins at 9:00 PM, adding sparkle to the venue’s festive ambience as families and tourists pour in for the Diwali weekend.From October 17 to 19, Al Seef also hosts the ‘Noor: Festival of Lights’, a cultural showcase organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in collaboration with the Indian Consulate in Dubai and Teamwork Arts.Far more than just a fireworks event, Noor transforms Al Seef into a cultural crossroads, celebrating India's rich artistic heritage through:The festival begins at 6:00 PM on October 17, inviting families, residents, and tourists to dive into a multisensory journey of India’s performing arts.

The relevance of the 54th Eid Al Etihad and its history





The UAE has released the official brand guidelines for the 54th Eid Al Etihad (National Day) so everyone, families, shopkeepers, schools and designers can celebrate in one clear style. The rules explain the logo, colours, what’s allowed (and what isn’t), and how you can take part in month-long festivities from Flag Day to Eid Al Etihad.The Eid Al Etihad 54th brand guidelines were officially unveiled by the UAE Government Media Office (GMO) in Abu Dhabi.

Leavitt Clashes With Reporter As She Bashes Trump’s Portland Action | Watch





The Federal Aviation Administration warned that Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening, as the government shutdown leaves many airport staff working without pay.The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm (local time).Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to Southern California TRACON, an approach and departure team based in San Diego, which will communicate with pilots landing and taking off from the airport, as reported by ABC News.Officials expect minimal disruption for travelers, though the full impact remains uncertain.An FAA advisory notes that several staffing triggers have been activated, resulting in ground delays at airports in Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Phoenix.Air travel delays were widely anticipated as the government shutdown extended into its sixth day on Monday following a failed Senate vote. During the shutdown, numerous airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay.Control towers and airport security checkpoints continue to operate, with roughly 13,200 air traffic controllers and over 61,000 TSA employees expected to remain on duty.California Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the staffing shortage at Burbank Airport to US President Donald Trump.“Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4.15 pm to 10.00 pm today because of YOUR government shutdown,” Newsom said through a post on X.During the 35-day government shutdown in 2019, absences among air traffic controllers and TSA officers increased as employees missed paychecks, leading to longer checkpoint wait times at some airports. Air traffic in New York was slowed as a result, putting additional pressure on lawmakers to resolve the standoff quickly.The current shutdown comes amid existing staffing shortages at both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration, including a deficit of roughly 3,000 air traffic controllers. If the system cannot manage the scheduled flights, the FAA may slow landings and takeoffs, leading to increased delays and cancellations for passengers, as cited by ABC News.Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday, the Senate once again rejected funding proposals from both parties. The Democratic plan failed 45–55, and the Republican measure was defeated 52–42, with both falling short of the 60 votes needed for approval.","Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening.

Farouk Hosny (Egypt): A former Egyptian Minister of Culture. He was Egypt’s candidate for UNESCO Director-General in 2009. Although he was considered a strong contender, his candidacy ran into controversy when he made statements about allegedly “burning Israeli books,” which raised objections internationally.

Moushira Khattab (Egypt): In 2017, she was nominated by Egypt for the UNESCO chief job. She’s a seasoned diplomat and human rights advocate. Her candidacy didn’t succeed, but it showed increasing ambition from Arab states to secure this leadership role.

Samira bint Mohamed Al-Moosa (Oman): A long-standing figure in UNESCO’s governance framework. She has served as Oman’s ambassador and permanent delegate to UNESCO and was elected representative of Oman to the Executive Board, chairing several committees. While she did not run for Director-General, her work shows Arab women have held influential UNECO positions.

Big challenges ahead — budgets, politics and priorities





Egypt’s former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Dr. Khaled El-Enany, is set to make history. On October 6, 2025, the UNESCO Executive Board nominated him to become the organization’s next Director-General, marking the first time an Arab candidate has reached this stage. His nomination now awaits approval from UNESCO ’s General Conference in November 2025, where all 194 member states will cast their votes.Born in 1971, Dr. Khaled El-Enany is an Egyptologist, academic, and heritage preservation expert with decades of experience in archaeology and cultural diplomacy. Before entering public office, he taught Egyptology at Helwan University and later became the founding director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.El-Enany served as Egypt’s Minister of Antiquities (2016–2019) and then as Minister of Tourism and Antiquities (2019–2022), a merger that allowed him to oversee both heritage protection and tourism development. During his tenure, he led major projects including:His blend of scholarship and administrative skill helped him gain the trust of Arab and African nations, securing their votes during the UNESCO Executive Board’s election.The UNESCO Executive Board held its election on October 6, 2025, where El-Enany won by a wide margin — 55 votes to 2 — against Firmin Edouard Matoko of the Republic of Congo. This strong backing positions him as the clear favourite for the final vote at the UNESCO General Conference in November, where all 194 member states will confirm or reject the nomination. If confirmed, El-Enany will officially take office in early 2026 for a four-year term as UNESCO’s Director-General, succeeding Audrey Azoulay of France.El-Enany’s potential appointment is being celebrated across the Arab region as a symbolic and diplomatic milestone — a first in UNESCO’s history.His leadership could bring a renewed focus on:Experts say his background in archaeology and tourism gives him a unique, hands-on perspective to lead UNESCO’s cultural agenda, bridging global heritage with sustainable development.Here are some Arab figures who either ran for the UNESCO Director-General position in past years or have played significant roles related to UNESCO:UNESCO is facing a tight financial period after recent withdrawals by major contributors, leaving a sizable budget gap that the new leader will urgently need to address. El-Enany has flagged funding, depoliticizing programmatic work, and strengthening UNESCO’s technical and advisory role as top priorities. He and supporters have also suggested increasing private-sector partnerships and exploring innovative new funding streams to stabilise UNESCO’s vital programmes. Restoring or improving ties with key member states is also firmly on the agenda.","Khaled El-Enany, Egypt’s former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, is set to make history.

Derrick Groves, the last of 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly five months ago, was captured at a residence in Atlanta on Wednesday, the US marshals service confirmed.Groves, convicted of murdering two men during Mardi Gras 2018, had been on the run since May 16 after breaking out of the Orleans justice center with nine other prisoners.Deputy US Marshal Brian Fair said Groves was located after a tip to Crimestoppers Greater New Orleans and further investigation. The arrest followed a standoff with Atlanta Police and US marshals.“It took almost three hours to locate him in the house, gas had to be deployed into the house multiple times by (the) Atlanta Police Department’s SWAT team, and he was ultimately located hiding in a crawl space,” Fair told CNN.New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams called the escape “a serious breach of public safety and a historic failure of custodial security.” He added, “his capture brings long-awaited calm to victims, their families, the witnesses who testified, the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted him and the people of New Orleans.”Groves was convicted on two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder, crimes that carry a life sentence.The jailbreak occurred shortly after midnight on May 16, when inmates used electric hair trimmers to cut through the walls of a cell behind a toilet, which they then concealed by replacing the toilet. Before fleeing, the prisoners left a message on a wall: “To Easy LoL.”The operation to capture Groves involved collaboration among multiple agencies including the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, New Orleans Police, Louisiana state police, Homeland security investigations, and the FBI.Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill said Groves will face charges related to the escape and vowed to prosecute “to the full extent of the law.”",Derrick Groves was convicted of murdering two men during Mardi Gras 2018.

Ex-FBI Chief James Comey Lambasts US President’s ‘Secret’ After Being Indicted | Watch





Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during his federal court arraignment on charges brought following a public campaign by US President Donald Trump to prosecute him.Comey, who was indicted last month by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, faces two charges: making false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment followed Trump’s social media call urging attorney general Pam Bondi to charge Comey, stating, ""We can't delay any longer.""During the brief hearing, Comey’s attorney, Pat Fitzgerald, waived the reading of the indictment and requested a jury trial. Comey himself spoke only once, affirming his understanding of his rights, saying, “I do your honor, thank you very much.” A trial date was set for January 5, with an expected duration of two to three days.Comey’s legal team plans to file motions challenging the charges as a vindictive and selective prosecution, and question the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer, as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.Fitzgerald described Halligan’s appointment as “unlawful” and indicated they would also raise issues of “grand jury abuse” and “outrageous government conduct.”The charges stem from allegations that Comey lied to Congress about authorizing a third party to anonymously leak information regarding an FBI investigation. Comey has consistently denied the allegations, telling the Senate in 2017 and again in 2020, “I stand by the testimony.”The prosecution’s case was unusual, with Halligan, who lacks prosecutorial experience, presenting it alone to the grand jury after Trump pressured the previous acting US attorney to resign. While Halligan sought three charges, the grand jury found probable cause for two.Comey is due to appear before US district judge Michael Nachmanoff, with additional prosecutors Nathaniel Lemons and Gabriel J Diaz from a North Carolina US attorney’s office assisting in the case.Comey’s daughter, a former federal prosecutor herself, was present in court to support her father.This case is part of a broader pattern since Trump’s return to office, where he has called for charges against several political opponents, including New York attorney general Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff.A group of former federal judges recently warned that the prosecution poses a “grave danger” to Americans’ rights, accusing Trump of “corruptly abusing the power of his office by directing the United States department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to target his critics and his perceived political enemies.”","Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during his federal court arraignment on charges brought following a public campaign by US President Donald Trump to prosecute him.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province.

LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

Nineteen terrorists of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and 11 soldiers were killed during an intelligence-based operation in the Orakzai district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, the military said.

A sanitisation operation is ongoing to eliminate any remaining militants in the area.Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP called off its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region in the third quarter of 2025, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of total violence-related fatalities and over 67 per cent (221) of violent incidents.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, both sharing porous borders with Afghanistan, accounted for more than 96 per cent of terrorist-related violence in the country.According to the Reuters sources, the attack targeted a convoy of paramilitary troops operating in a volatile region that has seen repeated militant assaults in recent years. Security forces have launched a search operation to track down the attackers, while the government has yet to issue an official statement.Roadside bombs hit the convoy before a large group of militants opened fire in the northwestern district of Kurram, five Pakistani security officials told Reuters.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement to a Reuters reporter.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Bangladesh's interim government on Wednesday described foreign secretary Vikram Misri's comments on the general election as ""completely unwarranted"", saying it is entirely an internal affair of the country.""I see that statement as not their matter; it is entirely an internal issue for Bangladesh, and such comments are completely unwarranted,” Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain told reporters.Hossain made the remarks when asked to comment on Misri's statement that India is firmly in favour of holding free, fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh at the earliest, and it is ready to work with any government chosen by the people in the polls.Dhaka-New Delhi ties were strained after the interim government assumed power following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League regime in a violent student-led movement dubbed the “July Uprising” in August 2024, when she left for India.The interim government in May disbanded Awami League’s activities until the trial of Hasina and leaders of her government were completed on charges of brutal attempts to tame the July protestors and other alleged misdeeds carried out during her protracted regime from 2009.Analysts said Misri’s call for “inclusive and participatory” elections in Bangladesh carried a political significance, while most of the Awami League leaders were imprisoned or on the run at home and abroad.The interim government earlier sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina’s extradition to stand trial, as she is being tried in absentia.","Bangladesh's interim government described foreign secretary Vikram Misri's comments on the general election as ""completely unwarranted"" India is firmly in favour of holding free, fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh at the earliest, foreign secretary Misri said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124389646,imgsize-57596,width-400,resizemode-4/vikram-misri-on-bangladesh-election.jpg"

Poll Do you believe the international community is doing enough to protect civilians in Myanmar? Yes No





At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday, a spokesperson for the exiled National Unity Government told the BBC.Hundreds had gathered in Chaung U township in central Myanmar on Monday evening for the Thadingyut full moon festival when the military dropped bombs on the crowd, according to a member of the organizing committee.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said the gathering included both the festival and an anti-junta demonstration.""The committee alerted people and one-third of the crowd managed to flee,"" the woman was quoted as saying by AFP. ""But immediately, one motor-powered paraglider flew right over the crowd"", dropping two bombs on the centre of the gathering.""Children were completely torn apart,"" she added.She said that once another motorized paraglider flying overhead had left the area, people rushed in to assist the wounded.Locals said that the damage from Monday’s bombings made it difficult to identify the victims.""As of this morning, we were still collecting body parts from the ground -- pieces of flesh, limbs, parts of bodies that were blown apart,"" the woman added.The junta has increasingly turned to paramotors due to a shortage of aircraft and helicopters, a situation compounded by international sanctions that have made it harder for the regime to acquire military equipment, as cited by the BBC.In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International described the junta's use of motorized paragliders to target communities as part of a “disturbing trend” in the region.Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack “should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection.”Myanmar has been engulfed in civil conflict since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, prompting pro-democracy forces to take up arms and align with ethnic armed groups against the junta.At the candlelight vigil, participants protested military conscription and the upcoming elections while calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.The country is scheduled to hold general elections in December, the first since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, argue that the vote will not be free or fair, and is likely to enable the junta to maintain unchecked control.","At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday.

From fields to fame: Majestic water buffaloes crowned in Chonburi; crowds applaud Thailand’s unique beauty contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-fields-to-fame-majestic-water-buffaloes-crowned-in-chonburi-crowds-applaud-thailands-unique-beauty-contest/articleshow/124364600.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session.

Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.

LONDON: IndiGo will launch daily flights between New Delhi and Manchester. The new direct service was announced at the start of the trade mission to India led by UK PM Keir Starmer.This comes just months after IndiGo picked Manchester airport for its first ever long-haul route into Europe, launching direct flights between Mumbai and Manchester in July.It means that from November there will be nine direct flights a week between Manchester and India. There will be five flights a week from Mumbai to Manchester, and four a week from Delhi to Manchester.Until now, there were three direct flights from Mumbai to Manchester. Manchester airport is now the only UK airport outside London to have direct services to both Mumbai and Delhi. They will all operate from Manchester’s state-of-the-art £1.3 billion Terminal 2.The two routes are expected to generate increased exports worth more than £33.5 million a year, £26 million in tourism income from Indian visitors, 500 new jobs, and more than £26 million of productivity savings for UK businesses.Chief secretary to the UK Treasury James Murray said: “Manchester airport has recently had a large amount of investment which has enabled Terminal 2 to be renovated and expanded, and on the basis of the extra capacity IndiGo chose Manchester airport.”British Airways on Wednesday confirmed it will introduce a third daily flight between Delhi and London Heathrow in 2026, subject to regulatory and capacity approval, and will look for further growth opportunities in India as trade between the UK and India increases.",IndiGo will launch daily flights between New Delhi and Manchester.

Following the collapse of a case against two British men accused of spying for China , the UK’s chief prosecutor said on Tuesday the case fell apart because the government refused to label the Chinese government a “national threat.”“No one from the government was willing to testify that, at the time of the offense, China represented a threat to national security,” The Associated Press quoted Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson as saying.“When this (refusal to designate China as a 'threat') became apparent, the case could not proceed,” Parkinson wrote in a letter to lawmakers on Parliament’s home affairs and justice committees.The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Barry, an academic, was dropped last month, weeks before their trial was due to begin. Prosecutors claimed there was not “enough evidence” to proceed, sparking allegations of ""political interference"" — a charge the Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer denies.Cash and Barry, who both deny wrongdoing, were charged in April 2024 with violating the Official Secrets Act by providing information or documents that could be “useful to an enemy” and “prejudicial to the safety or interests” of the UK between late 2021 and February 2023.The century-old law requires prosecutors to show that the defendants acted on behalf of an “enemy.”British intelligence has repeatedly warned about Beijing’s covert activities, and Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee labelled China a “strategic threat” in 2023. However, the UK government has only referred to it as a “strategic challenge.”The Labour government has sought to cautiously reset ties with Beijing after years of frosty relations over spying allegations, human rights concerns, China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war, and the crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Prime Minister Starmer is expected to travel to China next year.Asked about the spying case, he shifted blame to the previous Conservative administration. “The government couldn’t provide the testimony prosecutors wanted because the Conservatives had not designated China a ‘threat,’ instead calling it an epoch-defining challenge,” he said. “You can’t prosecute someone two years later in relation to a designation that wasn’t in place at the time.”The Chinese embassy dismissed the allegations as “fabricated” and called them “malicious slander.”","The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Barry, an academic, was dropped last month.

Farage ‘Exposes’ Starmer’s ‘Islamophobia Law In Britain’ Bid Amid Showdown In US House | Watch





LONDON: A British Sikh organisation has threatened to take legal action against the UK government over a potential new definition of Islamophobia and the decision to appoint a working group to develop one, pointing out that any government-backed definition risks discriminating against other faiths.The Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed, raising concerns over the impact of any definition on Sikhs and on freedom of religion and speech in Britain.The anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia working group was set up in March 2025 to develop a non-statutory definition of Islamophobia to provide the UK government and other relevant bodies with a greater understanding of prejudice against Muslims. Ministers may opt not to accept the definition.The letter that the NSO is preparing to seek a judicial review.The NSO argues that any definition of Islamophobia will also interfere with the right of Sikhs and others to freely manifest their religion and beliefs, a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Lord Singh of Wimbledon, director of NSO, wrote: “Sikhs are strictly forbidden to eat halal slaughtered meat because halal slaughter, especially non-stun slaughter, is inhumane.”Yet just asserting this would, by virtue of the 2018 definition of Islamophobia by the All-Party-Parliamentary-Group (APPG) on Muslims, be considered Islamophobic, he wrote.The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, gave his life defending the freedom of belief of Hindus who were being forced to convert to Islam. “Simply recounting this historical truth would be deemed Islamophobic according to the APPG definition,” Singh wrote.“There are countless other examples of Sikh (and indeed other religious and philosophical) beliefs and practices which would offend people of the Islamic faith,” he wrote.His letter also criticises the consultation exercise, saying it was carried out privately with select groups and that NSO was not invited to provide evidence.Officials at the ministry of housing, communities and local govt (MHCLG) told TOI they had received the letter and would reply shortly. The working group received a response to the call for evidence from the NSO. “The concerns they raised have informed the work,” a source said. “Any proposed definition must be compatible with the right to freedom of speech. That includes the right to … insult religions.”A MHCLG spokesperson said, “No decisions on a definition have been made, and we will not accept any definition which damages freedom of speech or discriminates against religious communities.”","Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed.

Police have dismantled an international organized crime gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year, worth millions of pounds.In what the Metropolitan Police describe as the UK’s largest operation targeting phone theft, 18 suspects were arrested and more than 2,000 stolen devices recovered.Two Afghan nationals were arrested last month on suspicion of operating a network believed to traffic up to 40% of all iPhones stolen in London. Authorities say the gang was moving devices to China on an ""industrial scale,"" where the latest models can fetch £3,700 each.“This is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations of this kind that the Met has ever undertaken. We are talking about some serious criminality here,"" commander Andrew Featherstone was quoted as saying by the Mirror.Police estimate the group could be responsible for exporting as many as half of all stolen phones from London, the city where the majority of UK mobile thefts occur.The investigation was triggered after a victim traced a stolen phone last year.""It was actually on Christmas Eve and a victim electronically tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport ,"" detective inspector Mark Gavin was quoted as saying by the BBC.""The security there was eager to help out and they found the phone was in a box, among another 894 phones.""Officers found that nearly all the phones were stolen and were being shipped to Hong Kong. Additional shipments were intercepted, and forensic analysis of the packages helped identify two suspects.As the investigation zeroed in on the suspects, police bodycam footage captured a dramatic mid-road interception, with some officers drawing Tasers.Dozens of phones were found in the vehicle, many wrapped in foil in an apparent attempt to conceal them, and roughly 2,000 additional devices were recovered from properties linked to the suspects.A third suspect, a 29-year-old Indian national, has also been charged with the same offences.Last week, police arrested an additional 15 individuals on suspicion of theft, handling stolen property, and conspiracy to commit theft.Most of the suspects are women, including a Bulgarian national, and around 30 devices were seized during early morning raids.The number of phones stolen in London has nearly tripled over the past four years, rising from 28,609 in 2020 to 80,588 in 2024. London now accounts for three-quarters of all mobile phone thefts in the UK, as cited by the BBC.""This is, without doubt, the largest operation of its kind in UK history, and it was humbling to see first-hand how the Met are going after the leaders of international smuggling gangs as well as the street robbers and snatchers fueling this industrial scale crime,"" Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said.","Gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. 18 suspects arrested and more than 2,000 devices recovered in UK's largest operation targeting phone theft.

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.

How the attack unfolded



Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area. Around 15 minutes later, the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack,"" the police said in a statement.“There were a large number of worshippers in attendance but thanks to the bravery of security staff, worshippers and the fast action of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,"" they added.Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle ""just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public"". She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter-terrorism response.

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

Drug Rings Busted: Türkiye’s Nationwide Sweep Leads to Hundreds of Detentions





Turkish authorities have launched a massive anti-narcotics crackdown, detaining 346 suspects and seizing large quantities of illegal drugs and weapons in a coordinated operation spanning five provinces. The Turkish Gendarmerie General Command led the raids, which targeted drug trafficking networks in Adana, Balıkesir, Nevşehir, Çanakkale and Bursa, underscoring the government’s intensified efforts to dismantle organised crime rings operating across the country.The operation, carried out on Saturday, February 21, 2026, involved simultaneous raids on 93 locations, executed by 635 personnel including public security teams, special commando units and 13 specially trained drug-detection dogs. According to official statements, the coordinated action was overseen in close cooperation with regional chief prosecutor’s offices and the anti-narcotics directorates, using both physical and technical surveillance to track and document suspects’ activities before executing arrest warrants.During the raids, over 80,000 psychotropic pills, drugs often linked to illegal street markets and abuse, were seized, along with around 11 kilograms of various narcotics, including high-potency substances typically trafficked for regional distribution.In addition to the drug haul, authorities confiscated numerous unlicensed firearms, including pistols and hunting rifles, as well as drug paraphernalia and precision scales believed to have been used in drug packaging and sales. These confiscations demonstrate the interconnected nature of narcotics distribution and illegal weapons trafficking that law enforcement is targeting.By detaining such a large number of suspects and seizing both drugs and weapons, the operation dealt a significant blow to criminal networks and disrupted regional distribution channels that were reportedly linked to multiple urban and rural hubs. Police spokespersons emphasised that the evidence gathered, including physical surveillance and documented drug offences, will strengthen prosecutions and contribute to long-term suppression of organised crime groups.Türkiye has been intensifying its efforts to combat drug trafficking and abuse for years, conducting repeated nationwide anti-narcotics campaigns. In a previous major action, the “Narkokapan-9” operation, authorities detained nearly 2,795 suspects and seized more than a ton of narcotics and millions of pills nationwide, highlighting the scale and persistence of the drug problem across the country.Located at the strategic crossroads of Europe and Asia, Türkiye is a major transit and distribution hub for narcotics moving between regions. Its borders and major cities have long been targeted by traffickers moving synthetic drugs, heroin , and other illicit substances, making comprehensive anti-drug law enforcement efforts a continuous priority. Recent government statements emphasise both punitive measures and preventive actions to protect public health, with heightened coordination among security agencies, prosecutors and border control units.Officials have stressed that drug trafficking and abuse not only fuel organized crime but also endanger public safety and youth wellbeing. Large seizures such as the 83,625 psychotropic pills in this operation reflect a growing public health concern, as such drugs often enter local markets and schools. The combination of law enforcement raids, targeted surveillance, and community outreach initiatives aims to curb both supply and demand, with authorities urging citizens to assist with intelligence reporting and cooperate with anti-narcotics measures. While the focus remains on intercepting large distribution networks, accompanying efforts may extend toward educational campaigns to reduce drug use among younger populations.This latest operation demonstrates Türkiye’s determination to tackle drug trafficking on multiple fronts, from high-level organized crime to street-level distribution and highlights ongoing challenges facing law enforcement in the region. Türkiye conducted a major anti-drug operation across five provinces, detaining 346 suspects involved in narcotics distribution and organised crime. Raids took place at 93 sites, with the involvement of 635 officers and 13 specially trained drug detection dogs. Authorities seized over 80,000 psychotropic pills, 11 kg of drugs, unlicensed firearms and drug paraphernalia, disrupting illegal networks.The action reflects long-term nationwide efforts to combat drug trafficking and abuse, with past operations detaining thousands of suspects in broader crackdowns. Law enforcement’s use of technical and physical surveillance in the lead-up to the raids underscores a coordinated, intelligence-led approach to tackling narcotics crime.","Türkiye conducted a major anti-drug operation across five provinces, detaining 346 suspects involved in narcotics.

These ‘living’ rocks in Romania can grow and give birth to new stones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/these-living-rocks-in-romania-can-grow-and-give-birth-to-new-stones/articleshow/128646758.cms,"These ‘living’ rocks in Romania can grow and give birth to new stones



Romanian trovants are sandstone concretions that expand through mineral deposits



Growth happens slowly through mineral deposits



Local folklore shaped early beliefs about living rocks





In a quiet part of southern Romania, rounded sandstone formations sit in open fields and woodland edges, drawing steady scientific interest. Known as 'trovants', these stones are often described as living rocks because they appear to grow and, in some cases, form smaller offshoots that separate from the main body. The best-known examples are found near the village of Costeşti in Vâlcea County, where a protected site called the Muzeul Trovantilor preserves several large specimens. The structures are classified as cemented sandstone concretions formed millions of years ago. While folklore has long surrounded them, geologists attribute their unusual shapes and gradual expansion to natural chemical and sedimentary processes rather than biological activity.Geologists link trovants to sediment deposits dating back to the Middle Miocene period, more than five million years ago. At that time, parts of present-day Romania were shaped by rivers and shallow waters. Layers of sand accumulated and were later compacted.The stones are made of sand grains bound together by calcium carbonate. This limestone cement formed underground, slowly hardening around a core. Earthquakes may have played a role in shaping and compressing the material.Over time, erosion exposed the rounded masses at the surface.Unlike most rocks that gradually wear down, trovants can expand in size. The process is subtle. During heavy rainfall, the porous stone absorbs water containing dissolved calcium carbonate. As the water moves through the rock, mineral cement can accumulate near the surface.In certain conditions, pressure builds unevenly. A small bulge may appear on one side. With time, that bulge can enlarge and detach, creating what looks like a smaller baby rock beside the original. Growth is extremely slow. Estimates suggest only a few centimetres of expansion over many centuries.The unusual forms have long fed local stories. Some residents once believed the stones were fossilised dinosaur eggs or remnants of alien activity. The term trovant was introduced by a Romanian naturalist and translates roughly as cemented sand.There are also stories that say the rocks can move. People often say that it looks like the falling rocks in Death Valley, USA. There isn't strong proof to prove that the stones are moving, but some researchers think that the stones might move slightly as the soil expands and contracts during heating and cooling cycles.Trovants are still interesting geological features, but they are no longer secrets. They are watching the rain and time slowly fall on fields near Costeşti. The land was formed by water long before people came.","Trovants are cemented sandstone concretions formed millions of years ago.

A debate over an H1B visa setback has taken a turn after a MAGA commentator weighed in with sweeping remarks about India and Indian workers in the United States.Andrew Branca, a US lawyer and conservative commentator, sparked outrage after commenting on the plight of an Indian professional struggling with America’s employment-based immigration system. Referring to migration pressures, Branca said: “Nobody dreads being compelled to live in India like Indians dread being compelled to live in India.”The row comes amid a post on Reddit’s r/H1-B forum, where a worker described his difficulties after his employer’s green card sponsorship process stalled. The man, who said he moved to the United States in 2020 on an H1B visa, works as an Oracle and SAP Manager in the Bay Area. His company began the PERM labour certification process, but the Labour Market Test failed due to a high number of US applicants.“H1B to PERM issue, LMT failed, too many applicants. What to do next?” the post read. He added that he felt tense as permanent residency was central to his long-term plans and asked whether he should restart the process, change employers or prepare to leave once his visa period ends.Branca has frequently criticised the H1B system and responded with other attacks on Indian migrants.In a video posted on X, he argued that even significant tax contributions would not justify their stay, claiming Indian workers “stole” jobs from Americans. He wrote that even if Indians paid $100,000 in taxes, he would still support deportation, saying their presence compromises American culture.He has also linked reports of fake degree busts to claims that Indians misuse academic credentials for visas and described them as “low-IQ, low-trust, high-fraud,” alleging they aim to “make America more Indian.”","Andrew Branca sparked outrage after commenting on the plight of an Indian professional struggling with America’s employment-based immigration system.

"Meet Mariangela Hungria: The Brazilian scientist who replaced fertilisers with microbes, saving billions and restoring soil",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/meet-mariangela-hungria-the-brazilian-scientist-who-replaced-fertilisers-with-microbes-saving-billions-and-restoring-soil/articleshow/128663105.cms,"The science behind Mariangela Hungria’s breakthrough

From laboratory to farm fields



Transforming Brazilian agriculture



Global recognition and wider implications



A different model for the future of food

For decades, modern agriculture assumed that high yields required heavy doses of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. Mariangela Hungria proved otherwise. Working quietly at Embrapa, she spent more than 40 years studying beneficial soil bacteria that allow crops to draw nitrogen directly from the air. Her research helped transform Brazilian agriculture, cut dependence on chemical fertilisers, and turn Brazil into the world’s largest soybean exporter. In 2025, her work earned global recognition with the World Food Prize.Nitrogen is essential for plant growth. It is a key building block of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll. While nitrogen makes up most of the air, plants cannot absorb it directly. For much of the 20th century, agriculture solved this problem with synthetic fertilisers produced using fossil fuels. These fertilisers increased yields but also brought high costs, pollution, and major climate impacts.Hungria focused on biological nitrogen fixation, a natural process in which certain bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form plants can use. In soybeans, these bacteria live in nodules on plant roots and form a mutually beneficial partnership. The plant provides sugars. The bacteria supply nitrogen.Her contribution was not discovering the process, which was already known, but identifying and improving the most efficient bacterial strains for tropical soils and proving that they could work reliably at commercial scale.At Embrapa’s soybean research centre, Hungria led efforts to develop practical microbial inoculants that farmers could apply to seeds before planting. These inoculants replaced or sharply reduced the need for nitrogen fertiliser. Crucially, her team also worked on quality control and farmer outreach, ensuring the technology performed consistently outside the laboratory.As adoption spread, millions of hectares of Brazilian farmland shifted to microbe-based nitrogen supply.The impact was national. Brazil reduced its dependence on imported nitrogen fertilisers while maintaining high yields. Farmers cut costs and improved soil health. Emissions linked to fertiliser production and runoff fell. Over time, biological nitrogen fixation became standard practice in Brazilian soybean farming, underpinning the country’s rise as a global agricultural powerhouse.Hungria’s World Food Prize citation highlighted not only the scientific achievement but its scale. Few agricultural innovations reach tens of millions of hectares. Fewer still do so while lowering costs and emissions at the same time.Her work is now studied by researchers and policymakers in Africa, Asia, and Europe as fertiliser prices rise and climate pressures intensify.Hungria’s career offers a powerful lesson. Instead of forcing productivity through chemistry alone, agriculture can work with biology. Her approach shows that solutions rooted in local ecosystems can outperform imported industrial models.“This is not just about soybeans,” agricultural scientists often note. “It is about redesigning farming around living soil.”In an era searching for sustainable ways to feed a growing population, Mariangela Hungria’s work suggests that some of the most effective answers are already beneath our feet.","Mariangela Hungria spent more than 40 years studying beneficial soil bacteria that allow crops to draw nitrogen directly from the air.

About FBI raid

Who is Hannah Natanson





A federal judge in Virginia has declined to immediately order the return of devices seized from Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson during an FBI raid on her home, but expressed deep concern over the implications for press freedom and confidential sources.US magistrate judge William B Porter, presiding in the eastern district of Virginia, said Natanson had effectively been cut off from her professional work since federal agents confiscated two laptops, a mobile phone and a Garmin watch in the January search.“Ms Natanson has basically been deprived of her life’s work,” the judge observed during a hearing.Porter also suggested he was wary of allowing federal investigators unrestricted access to journalistic materials, noting that public confidence could suffer if the government reviewed protected reporting information.He has already temporarily barred prosecutors from examining the seized files and scheduled a follow-up hearing on March 4.Lawyers for the Washington Post argued the continued retention of Natanson’s devices was causing serious professional and personal harm and posed broader risks to press freedom.They urged the court to either return the devices or ensure any review of materials was conducted independently, rather than by a government “filter team.”Government lawyers countered that the seized material could be relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of unlawfully retaining classified national defence information.In a tense exchange, Porter questioned prosecutors for not highlighting protections under the Privacy Protection Act, a federal law designed to limit searches targeting journalists, when they sought the warrant. He indicated the omission raised serious concerns and noted he had initially declined to approve the search request.Lawyers representing the Post said more than 1,200 confidential sources could be affected by the outcome, warning that the seizure had effectively allowed the government to “commandeer” the reporter’s professional life.The case comes at a difficult moment for the Washington Post, which is grappling with layoffs and leadership changes, including the recent resignation of publisher Will Lewis.The FBI searched Natanson’s Virginia home on January 14 as part of a Justice Department investigation into the alleged leak of classified Pentagon information. Authorities said the probe focuses on a defence contractor accused of illegally retaining sensitive national security documents.Attorney General Pam Bondi said the search was carried out at the Pentagon’s request to protect national security. She alleged the reporter had been in contact with the contractor, though officials stated Natanson herself was not the target of the criminal investigation.During the search, agents seized her work laptop, personal laptop, phone and watch, devices that potentially contain confidential reporting material and source identities.The Washington Post described the raid as “highly unusual and aggressive” and warned it could have a chilling effect on journalism. Press freedom organisations also criticised the move, calling it an unprecedented intrusion into newsgathering.The Justice Department had previously maintained policies limiting seizures of journalists’ records, but those protections were rolled back during the Trump administration, allowing broader investigative powers in leak cases.Hannah Natanson is a Washington Post reporter covering the federal government, with a focus on former President Donald Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal workforce and bureaucracy.She previously spent six years covering education and is a graduate of Harvard University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree.Natanson has earned several major journalism honours. She was part of the Washington Post team awarded the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its coverage of the January 6 US Capitol attack. She also received a George Foster Peabody Award in 2024 for work on a podcast series examining school gun violence.In addition, she has been recognised by organisations including the Education Writers Association, the Society of Professional Journalists and the Poynter Institute.In a first-person article published last year, Natanson described the intense pressure of covering sweeping federal workforce changes, writing about the large volume of confidential calls and messages she received from government employees affected by policy shifts.The Washington Post has stated Natanson is not accused of wrongdoing and was present during the search of her home.","Hannah Natanson is a Washington Post reporter covering the federal government.

The UAE's healthcare vision



Why this matters?





The UAE has officially entered a new era of ""precision medicine."" Moving away from simply managing symptoms, Emirates Health Services (EHS) recently unveiled two ambitious gene therapy projects designed to strike at the root causes of autism and rare brain disorders.By leveraging genetic engineering, the UAE isn't just treating patients, it’s aiming to ""repair"" the biological blueprints that cause these conditions in the first place.The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children. These efforts mark a major shift from conventional symptom-based care to tackling the underlying genetic causes of disease, potentially transforming neurodevelopmental healthcare in the region.One key project focuses on genetic causes linked to autism and epilepsy. It is being developed in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), a world-renowned paediatric research centre.Scientists will work on enhanced gene delivery systems that target specific brain cells, which could:The project specifically includes rare conditions such as Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN), a disorder that often begins in childhood with autism-like symptoms and seizures before progressing to serious motor and cognitive decline.This strategy represents a major scientific shift because it aims to treat the root genetic causes rather than just managing symptoms.The second gene therapy initiative centres on neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers will explore methods to repair faulty genes and use advanced techniques such as:Artificial intelligence and data analytics will help researchers make sense of genetic information collected through national programmes like the Emirati Genome Programme, enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention for children at higher risk.This approach relies on cutting-edge technology and global expertise to refine treatment precision and open doors for future inherited disease therapies.Leading experts at EHS described the projects as part of a “strategic shift” in healthcare, moving from traditional care models to evidence-based, innovation-driven treatments that directly address the causes of genetic disease.Dr Issam Al Zarooni, Executive Director of Medical Services at EHS, highlighted that this direction aims to improve quality of life and local capabilities in advanced medicine and biotechnology.Meanwhile, Dr. Noor Al Mheiri, Director of Mental Health and Visiting Physicians at EHS, stressed that integrating scientific research with responsible clinical application is key to reducing the psychological, social, and economic burdens families face.Autism and rare neurogenetic disorders affect thousands of families globally and in the UAE. Researchers have long been exploring genetic and early diagnostic methods, including genome sequencing and machine-learning diagnostic tools, to better understand and detect these conditions.The new UAE projects build on this broader scientific momentum, offering hope for earlier, more effective, and personalised treatments that could one day change how conditions like monogenic autism and other brain diseases are treated.",The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children.

The US Department of Justice has fired veteran lawyer James W Hundley just hours after a panel of federal judges unanimously appointed him as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, marking the latest clash between the judiciary and the Trump administration over prosecutorial appointments.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the dismissal shortly after Hundley was sworn in by Chief US District Judge M. Hannah Lauck in Richmond, declaring on social media that the authority to appoint US attorneys rests with the president, not federal judges.Hundley, who had been chosen to temporarily fill the vacancy after the departure of Trump ally Lindsey Halligan, said it was an honour to be appointed by the court and added that he would continue supporting the justice system despite his removal.The abrupt firing highlights growing tensions over the appointment of interim US attorneys, particularly after several federal courts ruled that Trump administration appointees had been serving unlawfully.Federal law allows judges to appoint interim prosecutors if a presidential nominee is not confirmed by the Senate within 120 days, but the Justice Department maintains that the president and attorney general ultimately control such appointments.The Eastern District of Virginia position has been at the centre of controversy due to politically sensitive investigations involving New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey, both critics of President Donald Trump.Previous prosecutors overseeing the office either resigned under pressure or were removed following disputes over charging decisions and the legality of their appointments.Hundley’s appointment by judges was seen as an attempt to restore continuity in one of the country’s most influential federal prosecutor offices, often referred to as the “rocket docket” for its fast-moving cases.James W Hundley is a veteran criminal defence and civil litigation attorney with more than three decades of experience practicing in Virginia, Washington, DC, and Maryland.He has handled a wide range of high-stakes criminal cases involving allegations such as bank fraud, bribery, embezzlement, tax evasion, and computer fraud, while also representing clients in civil disputes involving contracts, civil rights, and trade secrets.Hundley has significant appellate experience and argued the landmark Dickerson v.

US President Donald Trump arrived hand in hand with First Lady Melania Trump at the Governors’ Dinner on Saturday, capping a turbulent week for the White House.The high-profile event unfolded amid glitz and ceremony but was overshadowed by fresh controversy surrounding the administration.The annual White House dinner with governors is typically a bipartisan occasion, bringing state leaders together for an informal evening with the president.This year’s gathering, however, became unusually contentious, reflecting tensions that have characterised Trump’s second term.In the lead-up to the National Governors Association meeting, Trump publicly criticised the association’s leadership, including Republican Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and Democratic Maryland Governor Wes Moore.He initially excluded Moore and Colorado Governor Jared Polis from a White House working session on Friday, before reversing course shortly before the event, as cited by AP.Several Democratic governors had threatened to boycott the event if members of their party were excluded from Friday’s White House meeting. Even after Moore was ultimately invited, some Democrats said they would still skip the dinner.The US president addressed guests who chose not to boycott the dinner amid disputes with his administration.He said the room was filled with “many, many friends and very competent people.”Trump also claimed that his administration had made significant progress in its first year, including on inflation and crime, and had earned respect worldwide.""We've transformed stagnation into growth, weakness into strength and chaos into order, liberty and justice,"" the US president said, as cited by the Daily Mail.The dinner ended earlier than planned after Trump was informed that the Supreme Court had struck down his sweeping tariff policy, according to people familiar with the matter.“President Trump has made this whole thing a farce,” Massachusetts governor Maura Healey said through a statement.When the dinner took place, no Democratic governors were seen in attendance. The black-tie event, featuring candlelit tables and formal decor, was attended only by senior administration officials and Republican governors.In brief remarks, Trump joked that state leaders “look in that mirror and say, I should be president, not him.”Officials who have attended past governors’ dinners said the event traditionally provides a rare opportunity for state leaders to engage informally with the president and Cabinet members outside the pressures of daily governance.Some also noted that the gathering offers a valuable chance to build relationships with governors from across party lines, whom they may not otherwise meet frequently.The dinner followed a major setback for Trump this week, after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping tariff policy on Friday.In a 6–3 ruling written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr, the court said Trump had exceeded his legal authority by imposing tariffs on most US trading partners last year, dealing a significant blow to a key pillar of his economic and trade agenda.","The annual White House dinner with governors is typically a bipartisan occasion.

Nicki Minaj reveals her ‘most meaningful’ gift – a Bible signed by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nicki-minaj-reveals-her-most-meaningful-gift-a-bible-signed-by-trump/articleshow/128664089.cms,"Trump's Compliment to Nicki Minaj Sparks Viral Memes & Fierce Backlash





Rapper Nicki Minaj has revealed what she described as one of the most significant presents she has ever received – a Bible bearing the signature of Donald Trump Posting on X, the Trinidad and Tobago-born star wrote: “One of the most meaningful gifts I’ve ever received in my entire life.”The accompanying image showed a leather-bound volume titled Donald J Trump, 45th President of the United States of America Signature Edition, inscribed with Trump’s autograph. The post quickly drew attention online, with some comments on the post questioning, whether ""you can autograph a book that someone else wrote?The gift comes amid a series of highly visible exchanges between the pair. At a recent White House reception marking Black History Month, Trump singled Minaj out during his remarks in the East Room, telling guests: “I love Nicki Minaj. She was here a couple of weeks ago. She’s so beautiful.” He went on to praise her complexion and joked about her long nails, asking whether they were real — a moment that swiftly went viral.Minaj has, in turn, embraced her association with the president. During an appearance at the Trump Accounts Summit in Washington, she declared herself “probably the president’s number one fan”, adding: “And the hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all.It actually motivates me to support him more.” She has also backed his policy initiatives publicly and appeared alongside him on stage.Her evolving political stance has surprised some fans of the rapper. In 2018, Minaj criticised Trump’s immigration policies, sharing her own childhood experience of arriving in the United States at five years old. More recently, however, she has spoken warmly about the president’s leadership and faith, saying at a conservative gathering that the administration is “full of people with heart and soul”.","Nicki Minaj has revealed what she described as one of the most significant presents she has ever received – a Bible bearing the signature of Donald Trump.

'It's on the way': Donald Trump is sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-on-the-way-donald-trump-is-sending-great-hospital-boat-to-greenland/articleshow/128663043.cms,"'Unacceptable': Danish PM Rebukes Trump Greenland Pressure After 15-Minute Closed Door With Rubio





US President Donald Trump on Saturday (local time) claimed that the administration is sending a ""hospital boat"" to Greenland. He further added that it is on its way to assist people who are ""sick"" and allegedly not receiving adequate care. Posting on Truth Social, he wrote, “Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!”.This post was accompanied by an image depicting the USNS Mercy, a well-known naval hospital vessel. The humanitarian initiative follows the President’s December decision to appoint Louisiana governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy to the Arctic territory. The effort is being coordinated in partnership with Landry to tackle medical challenges in the region.Louisiana governor Jeff Landry also reacted on X, thanking the President and saying he is ""proud to work"" alongside him on ""this important issue."" However, the exact nature of the health emergency and the mission’s specific goals remain unclear. Last month, Trump announced that he had ""formed the framework of a future deal"" related to Greenland during talks with the head of Nato.Trump has repeatedly highlighted Greenland’s strategic importance to Washington, even describing the Arctic island as an asset the United States could buy. This prompted Denmark to reaffirm its legal sovereignty over Greenland.Back in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump again pressed for American control of the territory. Addressing business and political leaders, he said “no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland, other than the United States”, while accusing Nato allies of failing to meet their obligations.Meanwhile, officials in Greenland and Denmark have maintained that the territory is not for sale. However, a senior White House official said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been tasked with preparing a proposal in the coming weeks to purchase Greenland, describing the effort as a “high priority” for Trump.The US President’s statement came after a series of sharp developments involving Trump’s trade and foreign policy positions. A day earlier, he raised the global tariff he announced from 10% to 15%. This follows a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court, which found his tariff actions illegal and questioned his authority to impose sweeping import duties without congressional approval.","US President Donald Trump claims administration is sending a ""hospital boat"" to Greenland.

'Khamenei Assassination In A Week': US Diplomat's Bombshell Prediction After Trump 'SICK MAN' Attack





The United States is weighing military options against Iran that could go far beyond strikes on nuclear facilities, with one scenario reportedly involving the killing of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son Mojtaba Khamenei. The discussions come as President Donald Trump considers limited military action even while nuclear negotiations with Tehran remain ongoing.According to a report by Axios, a senior adviser said US officials have prepared options “for every scenario”. “One scenario takes out the Ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” the adviser said, referring to Khamenei and Mojtaba, who is widely viewed as a potential successor. A second source told the outlet that the plan was floated to Trump several weeks ago. “What the president chooses no one knows. I don’t think he knows,” the adviser added.Trump confirmed on Friday that he is weighing potential action. Asked whether the US could carry out limited strikes during negotiations, he replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A day earlier, he said 10 to 15 days would be “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has signalled that Tehran is ready to move forward diplomatically. He said a draft proposal could be finalised within “the next two to three days” and that serious negotiations on the text might begin “in a matter of a week or so”. Araghchi insisted Iran was “prepared for diplomacy” as much as it was “prepared for war”.Meanwhile, the Pentagon has undertaken its largest military build-up in the Middle East in two decades. Additional warships, aircraft and air defence systems have been deployed, with two US aircraft carriers positioned at a distance from Iran. Hundreds of troops have been relocated from key bases, including Al Udeid in Qatar and installations in Bahrain.Experts warn that any attempt to target Iran’s leadership would be seen in Tehran as an existential threat. Iran has already told the United Nations that if attacked, US bases and assets in the region would become “legitimate targets”. With tens of thousands of American troops stationed across the Middle East, analysts caution that a strike aimed at regime figures could trigger a broader and far deadlier confrontation.","Senior adviser said US officials have prepared options ‘for every scenario’ 'One scenario takes out the Ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,’ the adviser said, referring to Khamenei and Mojtaba, who is widely viewed as a potential successor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128663147,imgsize-977924,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-and-ali-khamenei-ap-file-photo.jpg"

TEL AVIV: Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East. Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired Friday. Carlson said according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.Huckabee responded: ""It would be fine if they took it all."" Huckabee added, however, that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.His comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them extremist, provocative and not in line with the US position.There was no immediate comment from Israel or the United States. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has not had fully recognised borders. Its frontiers with Arab neighbours have shifted as a result of wars, annexations, ceasefires and peace agreements.","Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.

The families of six friends and mothers who were killed in a Sierra Nevada avalanche this week identified the victims on Thursday and said they were ""devastated beyond words.""In a statement, the families said that the women who died were Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt. The women bonded as most of them raised their families in the Bay Area and enjoyed regular trips to the Tahoe region.""They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors,"" the families said. ""They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains.""The women embarked on a guided, two-night trip to the Frog Lake Backcountry Huts outside Truckee, California, that was planned well in advance, according to the statement. They were experienced skiers who were ""fully equipped with avalanche safety equipment."" The families said they had many unanswered questions.Sekar, 45, lived in San Francisco, and her sister, Clabaugh, 52, lived in Boise, Idaho. Sekar's husband, Kiren Sekar, 46, provided a separate statement to The New York Times recalling his wife as ""authentic and unabashedly unfiltered,"" a woman who spread joy and enthusiasm to her circle of friends, her children's school and her neighbourhood.He said he and his wife were together for more than 20 years and that she raised their two children to love hiking, bicycling and skiing in the mountains.""Caroline spent her final days doing what she loved best, with the people who loved her most, in her favourite place,"" Sekar wrote.Apart from the sisters and Atkin, other avalanche victims were from Marin County, California, just north of San Francisco.The avalanche was the deadliest in modern California history, and one of the deadliest in the United States.The families said eight women had been on the friends' ski trip, which indicates that two of the friends survived. Three of the four guides died in the avalanche, according to their employer, Blackbird Mountain Guides.Many of the mothers were connected through Sugar Bowl Academy, a private, ski-focused school that said Wednesday that multiple victims had ties to its community in Norden, California, several miles from where the avalanche occurred.Marin County is a constellation of affluent, family-oriented towns where children's sports and ski vacations in the Tahoe region are a regular part of the culture.Rescue workers have not yet been able to retrieve the eight people who were found dead on the mountain because of severe storm conditions, according to officials with Nevada County, which includes the area where the avalanche struck. A ninth person remains missing.","Families of six women killed in avalanche say they are ""devastated beyond words"" Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt died.

US soldier accused of stealing $3 million to fund mansion and luxury cars: 'Stole taxpayer dollars',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-soldier-accused-of-stealing-3-million-to-fund-mansion-and-luxury-cars-stole-taxpayer-dollars/articleshow/128654876.cms,"



A US Air Force staff sergeant and his husband are accused of stealing more than $3 million from the government to pay for a luxury lifestyle that included high-end cars and a million-dollar home in Arizona.Staff Sgt. Richard Stefon Ramroop, 35, and Manuel George Madrid, 32, were charged in a 12-count indictment for allegedly running the scheme between January 2022 and December 2025. The US Department of Justice announced the charges on Thursday.Prosecutors say Ramroop used his position as a pharmacist at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson to order thousands of medical devices using government funds. After obtaining the equipment, the couple allegedly resold the items and kept the profits. Authorities say the scheme cost the Department of War more than $3 million.According to investigators, bank accounts linked to the pair received more than $11 million in wire transfers, Automated Clearing House deposits and other credits from companies that purchased the devices.The money was allegedly used to fund an expensive lifestyle. The couple bought a 5,622 square-foot property in the Tucson Mountains neighbourhood for $1.1 million in January 2024.The home sits on 4.9 acres and includes four bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, a grand double staircase entrance and a five-car garage. Madrid became the sole owner in May 2025 and sold the property that same month for $1.1 million.They also purchased several luxury vehicles, including a 2024 Porsche Cayenne worth $141,443.34 and a BMW i7 priced at $195,397.59. Other vehicles listed in court documents include a 2025 Ford F-150 Raptor, 2025 Mini Cooper S Convertible, 2025 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, 2026 BMW X7 Alpina XB7, and a 2026 Cadillac Escalade Sport Platinum.Officials seized the vehicles and other assets during a search warrant executed on 15 January.“The defendants allegedly stole millions in taxpayer dollars from the US Department of War to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, diverting critical resources away from their intended purpose,” Arizona US Attorney Timothy Courchaine said.They added: “Every dollar taken through fraud is a dollar denied to the mission it was meant to support.”“Fraud of this level is not just a financial crime, it undermines public trust, diverts resources, and threatens the integrity of our force. Every dollar lost to fraud is a dollar taken away from the security of our nation,” AFOSI Special Agent Richard Kautz said.Ramroop was arrested shortly after the search. Madrid was charged in January 22. If convicted, they face up to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit theft of government property, up to 20 years for wire fraud, and up to 10 years for money laundering.","Staff Sgt.

The family of Ashley Flynn, an Ohio teacher and volleyball coach who was shot dead inside her home, has spoken publicly for the first time since her husband, Caleb Flynn, was charged with her murder, describing their grief as overwhelming and calling her loss devastating.Ashley Flynn, a mother of two and a respected educator from Tipp City, Ohio, was found fatally shot in the early hours of February 16. Her husband, Caleb Flynn, 39, was later arrested and charged with murder, two counts of felonious assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of tampering with evidence. He has pleaded not guilty, and his bond has been set at USD 2 million.In a statement obtained by Fox News, Ashley Flynn’s family said they were struggling to cope with the tragedy.“Our hearts are shattered. Ashley brought endless light to our world, and we are trying to navigate this immense loss,” the family said, according to Fox News.The family also expressed confidence in investigators handling the case. “Our family believes this arrest was made carefully and not without serious consideration. After speaking with both local police and federal authorities, we trust the proper steps were taken and the process is being handled appropriately,” they said in the statement quoted by Fox News.According to court documents, investigators allege that Caleb Flynn shot his wife using a 9mm handgun and attempted to stage the crime scene to resemble a break-in, allegedly to mislead authorities. Emergency dispatch records indicate that a 911 call was placed from inside the residence reporting that Ashley Flynn had been shot and suggesting an intruder was responsible.However, officials later alleged that the scene had been tampered with in an effort to divert suspicion. The couple’s two children were reportedly inside the house at the time but were unharmed.Police described the investigation as complex and said multiple agencies were involved. Caleb Flynn was taken into custody on Thursday and appeared in court on Friday, where he entered a not guilty plea. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for February 26.Ashley Flynn was widely remembered by her community as a devoted mother, teacher and coach. Her family has requested privacy as they deal with what they described as a “complex situation” and urged anyone with relevant information to contact authorities.“We are clinging to our faith — just as Ashley did each and every day,” the family said. The investigation remains ongoing.","Ashley Flynn, a mother of two and a respected educator from Tipp City, Ohio, was found fatally shot in the early hours of February 16.

Who is Neal Katyal? The Indian-American lawyer behind Trump’s tariff loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-neal-katyal-the-indian-american-lawyer-behind-trumps-tariff-loss/articleshow/128649238.cms,"Big Tariff Relief Likely For India Despite Trump's Defiance, White House Signals Global Trade Reset





Neal Katyal is a prominent Indian‑origin American lawyer whose legal work played a central role in a major United States Supreme Court decision that struck down sweeping tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.The nation’s highest court delivered the ruling in a 6‑3 decision and was seen as a significant constitutional check on presidential power and a setback for Trump’s trade agenda.Katyal was born on March 12, 1970, in Chicago to parents who had emigrated from India. His mother was a paediatrician and his father an engineer. He grew up in the United States, later earning a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and a law degree from Yale Law School, where he distinguished himself academically.Early in his career, Katyal worked as a law clerk for Judge Guido Calabresi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. These experiences helped establish his deep legal grounding and opened doors to high‑level legal work.Katyal served in the Obama administration as Acting Solicitor General of the United States from May 2010 to June 2011. In this role, he represented the federal government before the Supreme Court, arguing numerous cases.Over his career, he has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, a record number for a minority lawyer.Today, he is a partner at the Washington, DC office of the law firm Milbank LLP and holds the title of Paul and Patricia Saunders Professor of National Security Law at Georgetown University Law Center. He is recognised for his expertise in constitutional and appellate law.In the recent tariff case, Katyal represented a coalition of small businesses and trade groups challenging the legality of Trump’s tariffs. The Supreme Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not give the president authority to impose such broad tariffs without clear congressional approval. After the decision, Katyal said the ruling showed that “only Congress can impose taxes on the American people,” highlighting the limits of presidential power under the Constitution.Beyond this case, Katyal’s career includes notable work defending the Voting Rights Act, challenging the 2017 travel ban, and contributing to significant constitutional law debates. His achievements have earned him honours such as the Edmund J. Randolph Award, the US Justice Department’s highest civilian honour.","Neal Katyal was born on March 12, 1970, in Chicago to parents who had emigrated from India.

Afghanistan said Sunday that “dozens” of people were killed and wounded after Pakistan carried out airstrikes in eastern border provinces, in one of the deadliest recent escalations between the two countries.Government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid in a post on X said, “Last night, they bombed our civilian compatriots in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, martyring and wounding dozens of people, including women and children.”Afghanistan’s Tolo News reported that the Pakistani army targeted a civilian house in Behsud district of Nangarhar province, leaving 23 members of a family buried under rubble. Only four people had been pulled out so far, the report said.The broadcaster, as quoted by ANI, also reported that the Pakistani Air Force struck a religious seminary in Bermal district of Paktika province and carried out multiple airstrikes in Khogyani district of Nangarhar.Pakistan conducted strikes in Bermal and Argun districts of Paktika, as well as in Khogyani, Bahsod and Ghani Khel districts of Nangarhar since Saturday.Islamabad confirmed the cross-border strikes, saying they targeted militant groups it blames for recent suicide attacks inside Pakistan.Pakistani media outlets also reported that the airstrikes focused on alleged militant camps along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.Geo News, citing Pakistan’s Ministry of Information, reported that seven camps and hideouts of Fitna al Khwarij (FAK), its affiliates and Daesh Khorasan Province (DKP) were hit. The ministry said the action was conducted “with precision and accuracy” in response to recent suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur and Bannu during Ramzan.The strikes came days after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a security post in Bajaur district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.Hours before the latest border strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in Bannu district, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location,” signaling rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that recent attacks, including a suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad that killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan militants acting on the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers.”He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.In a statement, Pakistan said it expects the interim Afghan government to prevent the use of its soil against Pakistan and called on the international community to press Afghan authorities to honour commitments under the Doha Agreement.Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said it reserves the right to target Afghanistan to protect its citizens amid rising cross-border tensions following the Bajaur attack, according to Dawn, as cited by ANI. “Pakistan very legitimately demands that Afghan territory should not be used for terrorism inside Pakistan. So, as long as this demand is not met, whilst exercising patience, all options would obviously remain on the table,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said at a weekly media briefing.Relations between the two countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed soldiers, civilians and suspected militants on both sides.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Poverty in Pakistan has climbed to an 11-year high of 29%, while income inequality has reached its highest level in 27 years, according to an official survey released by planning minister Ahsan Iqbal on Friday. The report estimates that about 70 million people now live in extreme poverty, defined by a monthly threshold of Rs8,484 required to meet basic needs, The Express Tribune reported.The preliminary findings for fiscal year 2024-25 show the poverty ratio rose sharply from 21.9% in 2019 to 28.9% during the first year of prime minister Shehbaz Sharif’s current government. This is the highest since 2014, when it stood at 29.5%. Inequality also surged to 32.7, the steepest level since 1998.The country now faces a 21-year-high unemployment rate of 7.1%, alongside record inequality and an 11-year peak in poverty. The minister acknowledged that stabilisation policies linked to the International Monetary Fund programme contributed to hardship, citing subsidy withdrawals and currency devaluation that fuelled inflation. Natural disasters and weak growth were also factors, he said.Rural poverty rose from 28.2% to 36.2%, while urban poverty increased from 11% to 17.4%. Provincial data showed similar trends: Punjab’s rate climbed from 16.5% to 23.3%, Sindh’s from 24.5% to 32.6%, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s from 28.7% to 35.3%, and Balochistan’s from 42% to 47%. Security challenges in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan “disrupt livelihoods, limit access to markets and essential services, and increase household vulnerability,” the report said.Real monthly household income fell 12% to Rs31,127 over seven years, while real expenses declined 5.4%, reflecting inflation outpacing nominal earnings. “The nominal rise in income was outpaced by inflation, causing real incomes to fall, according to the survey.”Iqbal was quoted by The Express Tribune as saying, “The journey to economic progress was first disrupted in 2018 and then again in 2022 consumption led economic growth caused the economy to crash in the following year.” He added that cash transfers under the Benazir Income Support Programme “are not the solution,” stressing the need for growth and wealth creation.Responding to criticism of PML-N policies, he said it would take three years to undo the effects of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's decisions and ruled out an early exit from the IMF programme, while expressing hope that sustained employment growth and income recovery would reduce poverty.","Poverty in Pakistan has climbed to an 11-year high of 29%, while income inequality has reached its highest level in 27 years.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) reportedly released a video purportedly showing Pakistani Army personnel in its custody, as a self-declared deadline for a proposed prisoner exchange continues to run.In the footage circulated on social media, shared by region's independent online news portal Balochistan Post, citing the group’s official channel Hakkal, several men appear on camera displaying what they say are official service cards and national identity documents. The individuals, identified by the BLA as detained servicemen, are heard appealing to Pakistani authorities. They claim that they were formally recruited, issued official documentation, and assigned postings, while questioning why authorities are allegedly refusing to acknowledge them.In the video, a soldier can be seen pleading to the Pakistan Army for help. ""How can the army say that we are not their personnel? Whose card is this [showing supposed identitiy card]?It's the Army's right? Look at my identity card, Pakistan also issued this to me,"" a soldier can be heard saying. Continuing his pleas, he addes, ""I request for God's sake, my father is disabled and I am the eldest at home. Do not commit this injustice by saying that we're not your personnel.Then why did you recruit me if you're going to say that we're not your personnel? Why are you saying the video is fake?""However, critiques have raised questions over the authenticity of the video.The video release comes against the backdrop of a seven-day deadline previously announced by the BLA for a prisoner exchange involving individuals it described as “prisoners of war.” The group added that three days remain before the deadline expires.The development follows recent statements by the BLA asserting that it had captured multiple Pakistani military personnel during coordinated attacks across Balochistan. The group referred to the operations as “Operation Herof 2.0.”Pakistani authorities have not officially confirmed the claims.

At least 16 people, including women and children, were killed and 14 others injured after a gas explosion caused a partial collapse of a residential building in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, Dawn reported on Thursday.The blast occurred around 4.15 am during Sehri at a residence in Gul Rana Colony, according to assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Jamshed Asher. He said the explosion took place on the building’s first floor. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.Rescue authorities later confirmed that the death toll had risen to 16.Rescue chief operating officer Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told the media that a gas explosion led to the structure’s partial collapse. He said the ground-plus-two-storey structure comprised small, individual rooms, which made rescue efforts difficult.“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” he said, adding that nearby structures were also damaged.According to a list issued by Rescue 1122, the deceased included eight minors, four women and four men, aged between two and 60 years. Among the injured were seven minors.Search and rescue operations were ongoing, with an urban search and rescue team and a disaster response vehicle deployed at the site.A district east police spokesperson said law enforcement personnel cordoned off the area soon after the incident was reported. “Police cordoned off the area and tightened security, while rescue agencies initiated a search and rescue operation,” the spokesperson said.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah, taking notice of the incident, expressed grief over the loss of lives.He directed authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and ensure the “best possible” medical treatment for the injured. He also ordered support for affected families and asked the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause.Building collapses remain frequent in Karachi, home to over 20 million people, amid concerns over unsafe construction, illegal structures and ageing infrastructure. In July 2025, at least 27 people were killed when a five-storey building collapsed in Lyari. Authorities had earlier declared the structure uninhabitable. The Sindh Building Control Authority has previously said that 588 buildings across the city had been declared dangerous.","The blast occurred around 4.15 am during Sehri at a residence in Gul Rana Colony.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Footage circulating online shows the aftermath of Pakistani air strikes on a religious madrassa in eastern Afghanistan, with rescuers digging through rubble and families searching for loved ones. Afghan sources told TOLOnews that the seminary in Barmal district of Paktika province was among the sites hit overnight. Local officials say more than 20 people were killed in the strikes that targeted seven sites across Afghanistan.The strikes, which began late on Saturday, reportedly targeted areas in Barmal and Urgun districts of Paktika, as well as Khogyani, Behsud and Ghani Khel districts in Nangarhar province. An AFP journalist in Behsud described residents using a bulldozer to clear debris as bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings. An Afghan security source said at least 17 people died when a house was struck, including 12 children and teenagers.Islamabad confirmed it had carried out what it called “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven militant camps along the border. In a statement, Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said the action targeted hideouts belonging to Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as Fitna al Khwarij, and affiliates of Islamic State Khorasan Province.The Pakistani government said the strikes were a response to recent suicide bombings inside Pakistan, including an attack on a Shiite mosque in Islamabad that killed dozens and assaults in Bajaur and Bannu. Hours before the cross-border operation, a suicide bomber killed two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel, in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the attacks were carried out by militants operating from Afghan soil. He added that Pakistan had repeatedly urged the Taliban authorities to prevent armed groups from using their territory to launch attacks.Kabul condemned the air strikes, with Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid accusing Pakistani generals of attempting to deflect from their own security failures. The Afghan government has denied harbouring militant groups.Relations between the two neighbours have deteriorated sharply since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, with border clashes in October leaving scores dead. A ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey reduced fighting, but tensions remain high as both sides trade blame over escalating violence.","Pakistani air strikes on religious madrassa in eastern Afghanistan.

Most political parties now realise importance of Hindus in Bangladesh’s electoral politics: Culture minister





Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in PM Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s central committee, said the administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over the phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman. He was also among the only four candidates from minority communities, all from BNP, who won in the Feb 12 elections.Among the 25 newly elected members of the National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury won from Magura-2 constituency.He received over 1.4 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami’s Mustarshid Billah, who secured about 1.2 lakh votes. Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous government led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country’s institutions in tatters.“Almost everything was in disorder,” he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track.He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was “completely broken”. He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in exams irrespective of merit. “It was done to falsely show that literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,” he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country’s cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, “all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner.” He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.“Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,” Chowdhury said.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. “They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,” he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, Chowdhury said it was the new administration’s duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. “We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,” he said. “We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India,” he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India. He saidgovt would strengthen these ties by focusing on traditions followed by previous generations while fighting fundamentalism.“We all together will work for a better Bangladesh,” he said.","Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over the phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman.

'Bad Neighbours Who Persist With Terror': Jaishankar Warns Pakistan, Hopes Improved Bangladesh Ties





Bangladesh will seek respectful, mutually beneficial relations with all nations, particularly its neighbours, grounded in sovereign equality and shared interests, the new Tarique Rahman-led BNP govt said Wednesday, indicating its intention for a reassessment of Bangladesh-India relations, strained during the 18-month tenure of the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt.Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First” would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. Under this framework, he said, “we aim at maintaining good relations with all countries, especially our neighbours, based on respect and mutual benefit.” “There will be comprehensive reassessment of Bangladesh’s external engagement, anchored in sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs, national dignity and honour, and reciprocity,” he told reporters.“The govt’s commitment is to a balanced and pragmatic engagement and where complexities or stagnation exist, efforts will continue to resolve obstacles and normalise ties,” Khalilur said — as the BNP has already indicated that though the new govt will not stop seeking former PM Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from New Delhi, the “issue” will not be a roadblock. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.“It will not be shaped by partisan considerations.”“Foreign policy is a very serious matter,” Khalilur said, adding that “the goal is to build a foreign policy that reflects the will and aspirations of the people of Bangladesh and pledges a strategy rooted in national interest and constructive global engagement”.Meanwhile, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed, after the first meeting of the Tarique-led cabinet, said the days of “mob culture is over” in Bangladesh. Ahmed said, “Mob culture is over in Bangladesh. Mob culture cannot be encouraged in any way.” He said there will be demands but those demands must be raised through proper processes and forums. Democratic culture will continue, the minister said.","Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First’ would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128535347,imgsize-645715,width-400,resizemode-4/128535347.jpg"

Tarique Rahman, in his maiden speech after becoming Bangladesh PM, outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity. He said, “As the head of the govt, I would like to draw the attention of the people of the country to one important matter — whether you voted for BNP, did not vote for it, or did not vote at all, you all have equal rights to this govt.”His remarks that were seen as an outreach to members of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) who screamed fraud after finishing — despite with increased support — far behind BNP, and also possibly supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League which was debarred from elections.The address also read like an indictment of the former Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, with Tarique emphasising that the new govt has begun its journey amid a fragile economy battered by corruption and misrule during, what he described, as a period of fascism, along with weak governance structures and a deteriorating law-and-order situation. “Restoring peace and security in the minds of the people by improving law and order and strictly controlling corruption is the priority of our govt,” he said.Tarique said every constitutional, govt and non-govt institution in the country will run according to established rules and regulations. “The rule of law — not party or political influence or coercion — will be final in running the state,” he said.In his address, he did not elaborate on his foreign policy. He, however, at the beginning of his speech said that “in a Bangladesh freed from subservience, a new govt accountable to the people through their votes has begun its journey”.Earlier on Wednesday, Tarique chaired the first meeting of the cabinet, which set a 180day priority plan, a departure from the norm of 100-day plans, with focus on controlling commodity prices, maintaining law and order, stabilising supply chains, and ensuring uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.","Tarique Rahman outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity.

He told one woman that he could get her shifts as a care worker and asked her to meet at a hotel in Paddington on June 21, 2025, where she would be helping look after a sportsman with injuries.Singh met her at the station saying he was a care assistant who would be working alongside her. At the hotel he left her in a room and said the patient would arrive soon. Shortly afterwards, Singh returned to the room claiming he was the “sportsman” and undressed, telling her he needed a massage. She refused and he became violent before assaulting and raping her.The woman ran out and got in a taxi.That evening, she received a call from Singh telling her the incident had been recorded and would go viral if she reported it.Despite that, she reported the incident to police the following day.Detectives tracked Singh down to the same hotel on Aug 11, where he was arrested.

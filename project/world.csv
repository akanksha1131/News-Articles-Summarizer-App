Technocrats in Trump’s inner circle: A growing divide

The rift within the MAGA movement is growing, as influential right-wing activist Laura Loomer openly criticized tech magnate Elon Musk and other powerful technocrats for their increasing sway over President-elect Donald Trump’s transition. In a fiery appearance on Steve Bannon ’s War Room, Loomer expressed concerns about Musk’s connections to foreign officials and his rising political influence, raising alarm bells within Trump’s base.Loomer, a fierce nationalist known for her unapologetic rhetoric, accused Musk and his tech counterparts of prioritizing their personal interests over national security . “They’re nothing but welfare queens,” Loomer declared, blasting Musk and others for accepting government assistance while attempting to gain control over critical sectors like defense. Her remarks are part of a broader debate about Musk’s growing influence within Trump’s orbit—leading some critics to label him a ""shadow president.""The tension escalated when Loomer brought attention to Musk’s alleged interactions with foreign powers, particularly Iranian and Chinese officials. “What does it mean for our constitutional republic if technocrats with billions have unfettered access to our leaders while being cordial with adversaries like China and Iran?” Loomer questioned, casting a sharp spotlight on Musk’s off-the-record meetings with foreign officials.Her concerns mirror those raised by retired Lt. Gen. Russell Honoré, who labeled Musk a ""national security threat"" in an op-ed for The New York Times. Loomer’s remarks struck a nerve, as Mediaite reported, with Musk’s foreign dealings now under increased scrutiny, raising alarms across party lines.The ideological schism within the MAGA movement is becoming more pronounced, especially regarding Trump’s ties to technocrats like Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy . Loomer’s critique highlighted how Musk and Ramaswamy’s support for H-1B visa extensions conflicts with the nationalist ideals championed by many of Trump’s supporters. Loomer drew a sharp distinction between the interests of these elite tech figures and the grassroots MAGA base, which continues to push for stricter immigration controls and more American jobs.Bannon, a former Trump advisor and prominent voice in the right-wing media, has only intensified his criticism of Musk. Mediaite reports that Bannon has repeatedly questioned Musk’s deep involvement in Trump’s transition, accusing the billionaire of overstepping political boundaries and giving business elites undue influence over political decisions.With tensions running high, the battle within MAGA over the role of technocrats like Musk and Ramaswamy shows no signs of cooling. As the Trump transition moves forward, Loomer’s fiery rhetoric reflects a broader concern about the influence of Silicon Valley on the future of American politics—one that may further fracture an already divided movement.","Right-wing activist Laura Loomer openly criticized tech magnate Elon Musk and other powerful technocrats for their increasing sway over President-elect Donald Trump’s transition.

What led to the deadly crash

Recovery and identification of victims of the Jeju Air crash may take until January 8 as families wait in the make-shift tents at Muan International Airport to claim the remains of their loved ones, Korea Times reported.""We can’t even hold a funeral until next Wednesday (Jan. 8). My grandchild hasn’t been identified yet. I can’t even send them off properly. Oh, my poor baby,"" a grandmother’s wails from one of the tents at the airport.Ko Mo, a 72-year-old whose son and daughter-in-law were among the victims, sat near the airport’s entrance.""Honestly, I’m scared,"" she said.""I went to see my child’s face for the last time, but I fear they’ll only show me fragments of flesh. Still, I must see it through — it’s my child’s face,"" she added as she broke into tears.According to South Jeolla Provincial Police Agency’s investigative department, out of 179 fatalities, the majority of bodies were severely damaged, making identification a painstaking process.""We’ve sent the victims’ remains to the National Forensic Service (NFS), but even with maximum effort and focus, preliminary DNA results won’t be available until next Wednesday,"" head of the probing agency Na Won-oh said during a briefing.""Apart from five bodies, it will be difficult to return remains to the families in a recognizable condition. For the rest, funeral procedures cannot proceed until DNA identification is complete,"" he added.The police are also exploring options to hand over remains to the families sooner if they consent.""If the medical examiner determines that remains can be released, we are consulting with the NFS to hand them over with written consent from the families,"" an official from the South Jeolla Police Agency said.All victim's remains have been moved to temporary mortuaries, with the identities of 141 victims confirmed as of Monday. Police are using fingerprints to identify victims where possible and relying on DNA analysis for those whose fingerprints were destroyed or not registered.A Jeju Air flight carrying 181 people crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, leaving only two survivors in one of South Korea’s deadliest aviation disasters. The two survivors, both flight attendants, were rescued from the tail section of the aircraft who were left disoriented and shocked after the incident.Investigations suggest the crash occurred when the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy. The jetliner skidded off the runway, its impact with the concrete fence triggering a massive fire. Emergency responders from the National Fire Agency confirmed the toll, recovering 179 fatalities and rescuing the two crew members.The flight, which had taken off from Bangkok, was attempting to land in Muan, a town located 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Seoul.","Recovery and identification of victims of the Jeju Air crash may take until January 8.

How two flight attendants escaped South Korea plane crash that killed 179,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-two-flight-attendants-escaped-jeju-air-crash-that-killed-179-bizarre-survival-mystery-lies-seats/articleshow/116812688.cms,"The Boeing 737, which was approaching Muan International Airport on Sunday, skidded off the runway and slammed into a concrete wall.

Two flight attendants aboard the ill-fated Jeju Air Flight 2216 were the only survivors in a crash that claimed the lives of 179 passengers and crew. Their remarkable survival can be attributed to one factor: the rear seats, which are statistically the safest part of an aircraft in the event of a crash.The Boeing 737, which was approaching Muan International Airport on Sunday, skidded off the runway and slammed into a concrete wall. The tail section of the plane, where the two flight attendants were seated, was the only part that remained intact, officials said, reported the New York Post.""Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of the plane looks almost impossible to recognize,"" Muan Fire Chief Lee Jung-hyun remarked at a briefing.The rear seats, long regarded as safer in crashes, have been the subject of a 2015 Time magazine analysis of 35 years of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data. The study revealed that seats located in the back third of an aircraft had a 32% fatality rate, compared to 39% in the middle and 38% in the front sections.One of the survivors, identified as Lee Mo, recalled the moments before the crash. He had just buckled his seatbelt when the plane hit the ground. The next thing he remembered was waking up in a hospital bed, bewildered. ""Where am I?… What happened?"" he recalled asking, according to the Korea Times.Flight attendants often sit at the rear due to their duties during flight, making it more likely that they were in the safest section. However, survival in crashes can depend on other factors, including proximity to an exit row, as Professor Doug Drury from Australia’s Central Queensland University explains. Though exit rows can offer a quicker escape, sitting near the wings—where fuel is stored—can increase the risk of fire or explosion.In addition, Drury suggests that middle seats, with a person on either side, may offer an added buffer, reducing the risk of injury.Despite this remarkable survival story, flying remains an extremely safe mode of transportation. The International Air Transport Association reported zero fatalities due to commercial aviation accidents in 2023. On average, there is only one accident for every 880,293 flights, making air travel statistically safer than buses or trains.As investigators look into the cause of the Jeju Air crash, new details are emerging about the flight’s final moments. The pilot, with nearly 7,000 flight hours, reported a bird strike that struck at least one engine minutes before the crash. This may have triggered an engine failure and disabled the aircraft's hydraulic systems, which control the landing gear and brakes. However, manual overrides exist for such systems, raising further questions.Aviation safety expert David Learmount weighed in on the tragedy, highlighting the concrete wall that the plane crashed into. ""It should never have been at the end of the runway,"" he told Sky News. ""It was verging on criminal to have it in place.""As investigators continue their work, the survival of the two flight attendants serves as a reminder of the role that seat placement, along with luck, can play in a crash—and how incredibly rare aviation accidents are in the broader context of air travel.","Two flight attendants aboard the ill-fated Jeju Air Flight 2216 were the only survivors in a crash that claimed the lives of 179 passengers and crew.

Trump team orders nominees to stay silent on social media after MAGA civil war over H-1B visas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tweets-no-trouble-trump-team-orders-nominees-to-stay-silent-on-social-media-ahead-of-senate-hearings/articleshow/116813134.cms,"US President elect Donald Trump

A tightrope walk for nominees

The need for discipline

Silence from key nominees

A tight-lipped strategy for success

In an effort to maintain control and ensure smooth sailing through the Senate confirmation process , President-elect Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has issued a clear directive to his cabinet nominees: stop posting on social media. The message, sent out Sunday, came just days before the Senate hearings are set to begin, and reflects the mounting pressure Trump’s team faces as confirmation battles loom.Wiles, known for her no-nonsense approach and nicknamed the “Ice Maiden,” reiterated in a Dec. 29 memo that no member of the incoming administration or the transition team speaks for the president-elect or the United States. “All intended nominees should refrain from any public social media posts without prior approval of the incoming White House counsel,” she instructed, aiming to prevent any missteps or controversial statements from derailing the delicate process.Though Wiles acknowledged the enthusiasm of those joining the second Trump administration , her directive was firm. The move underscores the high stakes involved as Trump’s nominees prepare for what promises to be a contentious confirmation process, particularly with a GOP-controlled Senate that cannot afford to lose more than three votes from its own ranks if Democrats push back.Several of Trump’s picks have already encountered waves of criticism in recent weeks, with nominees like Pete Hegseth—Trump’s pick for Defense Secretary—facing intense scrutiny over allegations of misconduct. Despite this, he has managed to secure some key support, including from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who recently praised his “encouraging conversations.”Still, Trump’s team has made it clear: any public social media engagement could spell trouble. The directive comes after the fallout from recent social media activity by figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who stirred controversy with their outspoken comments on H-1B visas. However, Wiles emphasized that the ban wasn’t directly linked to this recent uproar but was a precautionary measure as the Senate confirmation process gears up.The memo appears to be having its desired effect. A review by The Post shows that most nominees, including some with the potential for tough questioning, have stayed silent on social media. This includes high-profile picks like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, tapped for roles at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Intelligence, respectively. Both former Democrats have kept a low profile since Christmas, likely under the watchful eye of Trump’s team.Notably, Hegseth has been quiet on social media despite facing a storm of allegations, including accusations of promoting “anti-Christian bigotry” over his cross tattoos. The defense secretary designee had previously used his platform to push back against these criticisms, but with the confirmation process ahead, he has refrained from online battles.With the Senate confirmation hearings just around the corner, Trump’s nominees seem to be heeding the advice to stay silent, at least publicly. Behind closed doors, however, many have been working tirelessly to shore up support, including reaching out to senators across the aisle. The results of these efforts will likely shape the early days of Trump’s second term, and the stakes are high.As the battle for confirmation intensifies, the silence from Trump’s team speaks volumes. Whether this strategy of discipline will pay off remains to be seen, but for now, the focus is clear: keep quiet, stay focused, and prepare for the tough questions ahead.","President-elect Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has issued a clear directive to his cabinet nominees: stop posting on social media.

Russia rejects Trump's Nato deal for Ukraine peace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-rejects-trumps-nato-deal-for-ukraine-peace-complete-non-starter/articleshow/116812681.cms,"Time

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a scathing critique of a peace plan reportedly being floated by President-elect Donald Trump’s team to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the proposal, particularly its suggestion to delay Ukraine’s Nato membership, as fundamentally unacceptable to Moscow.Speaking at a news conference, Lavrov expressed outrage over the plan, which he claimed sought to suspend hostilities along the line of contact in Ukraine and transfer responsibility for the conflict to European forces, reported New York Post.“Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview withmagazine on December 12, their idea is to postpone Ukraine’s admission to Nato for 20 years and deploy British and European peacekeepers in Ukraine,” Lavrov said. “We are not happy with these proposals.”The criticism comes amid reports that Trump, who has vowed not to abandon Ukraine, is exploring strategies to broker peace while balancing European involvement. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s pick as special envoy to Ukraine, has suggested leveraging military aid and weapons as bargaining tools to force negotiations.Lavrov, however, warned that such a plan was a “complete non-starter” for Russia. He reiterated Moscow’s long-standing opposition to Ukraine joining Nato under any circumstances, citing the alliance’s “aggressive absorption” as the rationale behind Russia’s invasion in 2022.The foreign minister added that the onus was on Trump to initiate talks with Moscow. “Even if he tries to relaunch bilateral ties, he will have to swim against the stream,” Lavrov remarked.A report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, underscored Lavrov’s comments as indicative of Russia’s rigid stance. According to the ISW, President Vladimir Putin’s demands include Ukraine’s permanent neutrality, a downsized military, and regime change in Kyiv.As Trump prepares to take office, navigating Moscow’s hardline position presents a daunting challenge to his promise of ending the war. With Lavrov’s stark rejection, the question remains whether Trump’s team can craft a deal that satisfies all parties—or if the conflict will persist in its current deadlock.","Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a scathing critique of a peace plan reportedly being floated by President-elect Donald Trump's team.

Former President Donald Trump has reignited his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris , sharing a New York Post article ontoday. The article details Harris’ contentious clash with Teamsters President Sean O’Brien during her campaign, despite Trump already securing victory in the 2024 election .According to the article, Harris stormed out of a meeting with O’Brien, dismissing the powerful union leader’s support by declaring, “I’m going to win with you or without you.” This statement, made before her electoral defeat, has drawn fresh scrutiny after Trump amplified the story.O’Brien, in an appearance on, recounted the episode and criticized Harris for cutting the meeting short and answering only four of the Teamsters’ 16 questions. Carlson remarked, “Damn. I thought I was arrogant. That’s really arrogant.”The fallout with Harris led to the Teamsters breaking a 30-year tradition of endorsing a presidential candidate. Their decision followed concerns about Biden’s decline and frustration with Harris’ approach. O’Brien revealed that 59.6% of the union’s 1.3 million members ultimately supported Trump, compared to Harris’ 34%.Even after his 2024 win, Trump’s repost of the article signals his continued focus on undermining Harris’ credibility. By revisiting her controversial encounter with the Teamsters, Trump appears to highlight what he views as a key misstep in her campaign.Harris, who had secured the Teamsters’ endorsement alongside Biden in 2020, now faces ongoing criticism as Trump leverages her strained relationship with the influential union to bolster his narrative of Democratic disarray.","Former President Donald Trump has reignited his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris.

A gun was discovered near Balaji’s body, and the absence of others at the scene contributed to the suicide ruling. Yet, his parents argue that the investigation was rushed.“It took the medical examiner 40 seconds to declare it a suicide,” Ramarao alleged, as reported by The Gaurdian.Balaji had no history of mental illness , and his parents insist he had plans to visit them in January. ""This is not the behavior of someone considering ending their life,"" said Ramamurthy.Balaji, a computer science prodigy from UC Berkeley, began his career at OpenAI in 2020, working on projects that laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. He quit in August, citing ethical concerns about copyright violations.“If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” he said in an October interview with The New York Times.OpenAI expressed its condolences, stating it was ""devastated"" by the news and offered support to Balaji’s family.At a candlelight vigil attended by 80 people, supporters called for a deeper investigation.

Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic and clairvoyant often cited as one of the most famous seers of the 20th century, and has been called the Bulgarian Nostradamus, alongside the French astrologer Nostradamus. She was born in 1911 in what is now part of Bulgaria, in the Ottoman Empire of the time, and having lost her sight as a child announced that she had developed supernatural abilities. Baba Vanga 's predictions, based on a mix of visions, dreams, and an intuitive feel for the world, are always enigmatic, yet many of them have allegedly become reality. Her followers believe that her insights transcend time and space, offering a window into humanity's future. Know the most significant predictions, especially those for 2025, and some of her other notable visions.Baba Vanga's prophecies for 2025 involve a few key areas that may potentially alter the fate of humanity due to contact with extraterrestrial life in general and other geopolitical shifts.One of the most interesting aspects of Baba Vanga's prophecies is that she predicts that human beings will contact alien civilizations in the immediate future. This might be the year 2025, says her prophecies, marking a human history-changing step. It would be either the case that the aliens will make contact through further development in the exploration of space or as a result of discovery from Earth. The exact details of how this contact will unfold remain vague, but her prediction has drawn attention in the context of ongoing developments in space exploration, such as NASA’s search for extraterrestrial life on Mars and other celestial bodies.Vanga’s prediction aligns with the growing interest in space exploration and the search for alien life. The past decades have witnessed tremendous technological developments, ranging from the launching of probes to other planets, the discovery of exoplanets in the ""habitable zone,"" to the investigation of UFOs conducted by governments, especially by the U.S. government. These happenings bring about speculations that alien contact might be connected to these scientific pursuits being continuously carried out by scientists around the world.If Vanga's prophecy is correct, then contact with extraterrestrial life would have the most profound implications for human culture, politics, and technology. Such an event might not only revolutionize science and technology but also challenge humanity's understanding of its place in the universe. The global impact could be transformative, triggering global cooperation, scientific collaboration, and a rethinking of societal values.Another major prediction by Baba Vanga for 2025 is that Europe will experience radical demographic changes, which could be a result of political tensions and environmental factors. This may make Europe ""sparsely populated,"" with various interpretations of what this may mean.Perhaps, the ongoing instability as it happens during war and economic distress continues to shift the patterns of migration. This may even lead to the depopulation or displacement of some European regions, which would consequently mean a significant restructuring in Europe's population. Rise in nationalism, change of political power, or the occurrence of economic crises would be other geopolitical reasons that might influence this.Climate change and environmental calamities can also be a contributing factor toward this demographic shift. Rising sea levels, droughts, and extreme weather conditions may make certain parts of Europe uninhabitable, causing large migrations to these more stable regions. Baba Vanga's predictions on the subject may simply reflect a belief in the collective, interconnected causes by which human conflict, migration, and environmental factors are created.At least part of the population decline in Europe could be related to economic issues. Existing high unemployment and an aging population and decreasing birth rates in some countries have already started to affect Europe's demographic complexion. Vanga's prophecy could be an interpretation of the existing social and economic dynamics.The most exciting prediction that Baba Vanga made regarding the future of medical science is related to synthetic organs. According to her prophecy, man would be able to produce synthetic organs in mass production by the year 2046, and it would change everything in the medical world. This discovery will profoundly impact the quality of life for organ failure and chronic diseases and may give individuals more survival chances who might otherwise have not received any transplantable organs.All of these advances in biotechnology-from the bioengineered techniques to 3D printing-will quickly open doors toward constructing synthetic and bioengineered organs. In fact, with human tissue and organs grown in a lab, the scientists do not stop breaking boundaries even in developing artificial skin and blood vessels, to say nothing of the actual organ like the kidney. The mass production of synthetic organs, therefore, by Vanga might be something that could indeed happen soon, as such developments keep coming up.Synthetic organs shall be mass-produced and will hence solve the world's scarcity of organs besides making transplantation easier and more efficient. The cost of medical procedure may reduce, and persons with organ failure may no longer have to wait in a donor list. This is one prediction that is in line with what the future of healthcare will hold in terms of treatment because regenerative medicine and biotechnology are seen as the future of treatment.Baba Vanga also predicted massive natural catastrophes and climatic events, some of which have been interpreted as still being climate change phenomena. She said that huge parts of Asia would be submerged with water due to floods, and some parts of the world would experience catastrophic droughts. Her vision about such disasters is often tied to the rising concerns over climate change, sea level rise, and extreme weather patterns that are becoming increasingly frequent and intense.Baba Vanga predicted that artificial intelligence and technology will develop rapidly. She described a future where technology advances to such an extent that it starts beating humans in everything, even in the choice-making process and problem-solving abilities. She mentioned how humans should not let themselves get so dependent on technology, especially in the realm of war, because artificial intelligence may be misused and go out of hand. This is similar to the trend of development currently in AI and automation.Baba Vanga made several predictions regarding the geopolitical future, such as major power shifts and wars. She foresaw that a world war could occur in the 21st century, involving a global confrontation between major powers. This prediction has been drawn parallel to current global tensions, such as those between the United States, China, and Russia. The war that Baba Vanga envisioned was not just limited to physical combat but also involved cyber warfare and economic struggles.",Baba Vanga is a Bulgarian mystic and clairvoyant.

Why Don Lemon cackled maniacally and trashed MAGA fans as ‘Dumb f***ing idiots’ over H-1B visa feud with Musk; Social media reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-don-lemon-cackled-maniacally-and-trashed-maga-fans-as-dumb-fing-idiots-over-h-1b-visa-feud-with-musk-social-media-reacts/articleshow/116812682.cms,"Independent media personality Don Lemon haughtily cackled during an expletive-laden screed over the MAGA world flare-up over H1-B visas for specialty workers.

Social media reacts to Lemon’s rant

'Too delicious to ignore'

The Post

Don Lemon didn’t just comment on the latest MAGA drama — he gleefully tore into it. In a scathing, profanity-laced tirade that has since gone viral, the independent media personality mocked Trump supporters for their shocking inability to see through Elon Musk ’s support of H-1B visas, sparking a meltdown in the MAGA world.Lemon’s notorious maniacal cackle took center stage during his YouTube rant, where he mocked Trump fans as “dumb f***king idiots” for being blindsided by Musk’s position on the H-1B visa program. “You dumb f***king idiots! Now you’re just figuring this sh** out,” Lemon sneered, clearly relishing the spectacle of MAGA's internal strife.The chaos erupted after Musk and tech mogul Vivek Ramaswamy — both major figures in Trump’s orbit — threw their support behind the H-1B visa system, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers when they can't find enough Americans to fill the roles. The backlash was swift from staunch MAGA supporters, with figures like Laura Loomer slamming the move, accusing Musk of betraying the populist, anti-immigration cause.But Lemon wasn’t done. As the MAGA infighting escalated, he went on to tear apart the very core of Trump’s movement. “You have stupid MAGA brain,” he ranted, accusing Trump supporters of being too blinded by their allegiance to the former president to see what was really happening. “You’re in a f***king cult and you don’t even realize it,” Lemon added, mocking their lack of self-awareness.The comment seemed to be a direct jab at the MAGA base’s unwavering loyalty to Trump — even when he’s surrounded by figures like Musk, who have increasingly aligned with policies that conflict with the populist movement's anti-immigrant stance.The internet was quick to react to Lemon’s fiery outburst, with many users taking to social media to voice their opinions.One user commented, “Holy shit Don Lemon has officially lost his damn mind.” Another added, “He does sound hormonal af.”Another user took a shot at Lemon’s career, saying, “Since being fired from CNN, Don Lemon's career has crashed faster than Biden from sundowning. While Lemon pretended he left for his fake Liberal virtue, he really left because his ego couldn’t handle the mocking he received after his contract fell through. As you can see from this video, Lemon's situation is not improving. He should join Mark Hamil and Rob Reiner in the mental health facility. Don Lemon's video is not the flex on MAGA he thinks it is. Enjoy the meltdown.”Others took a more critical stance: “He’s hit rock bottom. I’m trying to find the interview where he asks random people whether they think Elon is actually the president. He cites MSM and gets laughed at.”One user remarked, “Don Lemon appears to be losing his mind. What stage of grief is this? ‘You’ve been co-opted into a cult and you don’t even realize it because you have stupid MAGA brain and you don’t get it. How stupid and dumb are you?’ Projection 101.”A more thought-provoking response came from another user who wrote, “The right hates Don Lemon because he’s black, intelligent, articulate, and factually points out what MAGA doesn’t want to acknowledge about themselves and their cult-like movement & leader. MAGA hates intelligent people of color.”Lemon’s rant also alluded to Trump’s controversial remark earlier this year about immigrants taking away “black jobs.” “Who’s to say that one of those jobs might be a ‘white job’?” Lemon chuckled, further driving the point home that MAGA’s rhetoric is often contradictory, especially as the conversation shifts on issues like immigration.Even as Musk and Ramaswamy defended the H-1B program, claiming it needed reform, the growing tension within MAGA ranks was undeniable. Trump himself later weighed in, telling, “I’ve always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.”For Lemon, it was all too delicious to ignore. Once a CNN anchor who found himself at the center of controversy over remarks about Nikki Haley, Lemon has embraced his role as an outspoken critic. With his latest rant, he’s shown that he’s not afraid to go for the jugular — especially when MAGA’s contradictions create the perfect storm for drama.","Independent media personality Don Lemon's expletive-laced tirade over the MAGA world flare-up has gone viral.

Texas governor slammed for offering condolences to Jimmy Carter's late wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-governor-slammed-for-offering-condolences-to-jimmy-carters-late-wife/articleshow/116809695.cms,"Texas governor Greg Abbott faced backlash after mistakenly including condolence for former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who passed away last year, in his statement mourning the death of former US President Jimmy Carter, who died last week.Abbott released a statement on social media expressing his and his wife’s condolences to “First Lady Rosalynn Carter and the entire Carter family.” The statement honoured Jimmy Carter’s legacy as “a husband, father, naval officer, governor, and Nobel prize winner.” However, Abbott’s message overlooked the fact that Rosalynn Carter had died in 2023 at the age of 96.Two hours later, Abbott updated his statement on X (formerly Twitter), removing the reference to Rosalynn Carter. The adjustment did not go unnoticed, as followers highlighted the error and questioned the governor’s team.“Did anyone in the Governor’s Office proof the condolence note?” asked a Democratic group in Texas. Another user wrote, “You sent condolences to Rosalynn? What world are you living in?”Rosalynn Carter passed away on November 19, 2023, shortly after entering hospice care. Her husband, former President Jimmy Carter, had been in hospice since February 2023 and passed away at the age of 100.In addition to the condolence mistake, Abbott ordered Texas flags to fly at half-mast until January 29, following President Joe Biden’s federal order to honour Carter’s passing.Abbott’s mistake adds to a series of similar gaffes. According to the Daily Beast, in 2023, he shared a satirical article claiming country singer Garth Brooks was booed off stage for advocating tolerance, captioning it, “Go Woke. Go Broke.” The post was quickly deleted after the article’s author, Christopher Blair, pointed out the mistake, calling Abbott “one of the dumbest people in the country.”","Texas governor Greg Abbott mistakenly included condolence for former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who passed away last year, in his statement mourning the death of former US President Jimmy Carter.

The incident, which he recounted both before and during his presidency, continues to draw interest.In a 2005 interview with GQ magazine , Carter recalled the incident, which occurred in southwest Georgia while he was preparing to speak at a Lions Club meeting.Carter recorded his observations on a tape recorder and later documented them.“There were about 25 of us standing around when someone pointed to a bright light in the sky,” he was quoted as saying by the New York Post . The light grew closer, stopped beyond nearby pine trees, and shifted colours from blue to red and back to white.“It was a flying object that was unidentified,” he said. “But I’ve never believed it came from Mars. I know enough physics to know that vehicles can’t fly from Mars, look around, and then return,"" he added.Despite his own sighting, Carter dismissed conspiracy theories about alien landings, including the infamous Roswell, New Mexico, incident in 1947. “I don’t believe in a cover-up of extraterrestrial visits,” he said.During his presidency, Carter encountered an extraordinary CIA operation involving a psychic. While investigating Roswell, he learned the agency had consulted a Californian woman claiming supernatural abilities to locate a lost plane in the Central African Republic. “She gave coordinates while in a trance, and when we sent a satellite to that location, the plane was there,” Carter revealed.Many US presidents, from Harry STruman to Donald Trump, have spoken about UFOs and alien theories.

The incident took place at Los Angeles International Airport and had it not been for the last-minute intervention of the ATC, a major mishap could have happened. The FAA has now launched an investigation into the incident.According to reports, the chartered Embraer E136 jet, carrying the men's Gozaga basketball team, had just landed at LAX from Spokane, Washington.The moment when the mishap was averted went viral as plane spotter Kevin Ray said he never heard an ATC controller telling a plane to stop like this. “Wow!

The report claims that his staff had formed a protective circle around the 82-year-old president, limiting his interactions with the public.“And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats,” Crawford said. “It could have changed the scope of the entire election.”As Biden's first term continued, more people questioned his mental fitness. News outlets, including The Post, highlighted his frequent mistakes and mishaps. His struggles peaked during the June 27 debate, raising more concerns about his ability to lead. In July, Biden dropped out of the race and was replaced by vice president Kamala Harris , who lost to Trump in the December election.Despite the backlash, Crawford expressed disbelief at claims by Biden’s advisers that he regretted withdrawing from the race and believed he could have beaten Trump. “Yet still, incredibly, we read in The Washington Post that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump,” Crawford said. “And I think that is either delusional or they’re gaslighting the American people.”CBS News' Robert Costa added that Biden and many of his top aides continue to insist he was simply unwell during the debate and has always been ""fine.""",CBS News reporter Jan Crawford said the most 'underreported' story of 2024 was Joe Biden's 'obvious cognitive decline' Crawford also referred to a Wall Street Journal report that revealed how White House aides allegedly concealed Biden's struggles.

Pakistan's jailed former PM Imran Khan says 'don't want to make any deal for release',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-jailed-former-pm-imran-khan-says-dont-want-to-make-any-deal-for-release/articleshow/116803612.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Monday said that neither he wants to make any deal with the establishment nor is any foreign country trying to get him released. The 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician's sister Aleema Khan shared this when she talked to the media outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail after the hearing of Toshakhan 2.0 case.Aleema said that Khan asks ""why he needs to make a deal when he is facing cases"". She added that Khan also said that ""he has faced jail and is not making any deals when his cases are ending"".The statement comes when a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) team is holding talks with the government to address various political issues.Aleema said that the negotiating team would make two demands, including the release of all political prisoners and formation of a commission to probe the violence on May 9, 2023 and November 26 this year.The next round of talks between the two sides is scheduled to take place on January 2 at 11 am at the office of National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq who is facilitating the two sides.In a related development, US President-elect Donald Trump's designated advisor Richard Grenell last week reiterated his demand for the release of Khan, saying, ""I would like Imran Khan to be released from jail. He has the same charges as Donald Trump. The ruling political party in Pakistan has put him in jail on false charges of corruption.""Commenting on Grenell's statement, Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said, ""I cannot comment on the statements of any one person. We will continue to hold talks with the US authorities.""Also, Khan last week had claimed that he was offered to be placed under house arrest at his Bani Gala residence from Adiala Jail as a result of a ""deal"", but he did not accept the offer.""I have received a message to make a deal with us, we will give political space to your party but we will put you under house arrest and transfer you to Bani Gala,"" Khan had said on Thursday while talking to his lawyers and journalists.""I replied that, first release the remaining political prisoners. I will stay in jail but will not accept any deal.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","A 13-year-old boy and a man have gone missing in Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation.

This decision has heightened concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts may increasingly handle cases tied to the former leader.The US State Department expressed ""deep concern"" over the verdicts, stating, ""deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023.""Similarly, the British foreign office raised issues of fairness, saying, ""trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial.""The European Union echoed these concerns, noting the sentences were ""inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.""The protests erupted after Khan’s arrest by paramilitary forces, during which his supporters targeted military installations. The military court ruling came on Saturday, just days after Khan was indicted by an anti-terrorism court.Khan, who was briefly released after his May 2023 arrest, was detained again in August and has remained in jail since.

SEOUL: South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier. Shares of Boeing dropped about 5% in early trading in New York.Sunday's crash, the country's worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and PM Han Duck-soo amid political tumult caused by Yoon's brief imposition of martial law earlier this month. New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash.The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren't clear. Then, during its second landing bid, it got a bird strike warning from the ground control centre before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 is a ""proven airplane"" that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Nearly 200 airlines worldwide use the Boeing 737-800 plane, which has been flying for more than 25 years.But South Korea's transport ministry said it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country's airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport 's localiser - a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft - should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. Officials said similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports as well as in the US, Spain and South Africa.Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul's Gimpo airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. A Jeju Air executive said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment centre, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precaution.",South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines.

Taliban orders NGOs to fire female employees or face closure in restrictive edict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-orders-ngos-to-fire-female-employees-or-face-closure-in-restrictive-edict/articleshow/116792864.cms,"Taliban administration announced a directive to shut down all national and foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Afghanistan that employ women.This move, made public on Sunday through a letter from the ministry of economy, comes two years after the regime initially ordered NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, citing alleged non-compliance with Islamic dress codes.The ministry’s latest warning, threatened NGOs with the cancellation of their operational licenses if they failed to adhere to the new rule.The economy ministry, while putting the directive, reinstated its authority over the registration and supervision of national and international organizations operating in Afghanistan.“In case of lack of cooperation, all activities of that institution will be canceled, and the activity license of that institution, granted by the ministry, will also be canceled,” the letter declared, signaling another step in the Taliban’s efforts to erase women from public life.Since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, women in Afghanistan have faced increasingly oppressive restrictions. Girls are banned from education beyond the sixth grade, women are excluded from most jobs, and their access to public spaces such as parks and gyms has been revoked.Adding to these measures, the Taliban’s supreme leader has issued an order banning the construction of windows in residential buildings that overlook areas where Afghan women are present. The decree, publicized over the weekend by government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, also mandates the blocking of existing windows that provide views of courtyards, kitchens, or wells commonly used by women.The directive claims that such visibility could lead to “obscene acts."" Local authorities have been instructed to monitor construction sites and ensure compliance, with homeowners encouraged to build walls or otherwise obstruct views into their homes.The international community has expressed growing alarm at the Taliban’s treatment of women. The United Nations has described the regime’s policies as ""gender apartheid,"" pointing to the systematic exclusion of women from education, work, and public spaces.The Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islamic law has also led to bans on women singing, reciting poetry in public, or even broadcasting their voices on local radio and television stations. In its defense, the Taliban insists that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of both Afghan men and women.","Taliban administration announced a directive to shut down all nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Afghanistan that employ women.

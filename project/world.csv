The ministry of energy and mines announced the outage on social media, “At around 8:15 p.m. tonight, a failure at the Diezmero substation caused a significant loss of generation in the west of Cuba and with it the failure of the National Electric System, SEN, and the recovery process is already underway.”Authorities have yet to confirm when full power will be restored.This marked the third major grid collapse in just two months, dragging attention towards the country’s energy and economic crisis.Before this, Cuba faced power outages last year as well. One was reported last year in October , after the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant, one of Cuba’s key power stations, shut down, leaving millions without electricity. The grid failure forced the government to implement emergency measures.Another severe blackout struck in December 2024 when the same plant failed again in the early hours of the morning. The shutdown at around 2 am disconnected the national grid, plunging more than 10 million residents into darkness.","Cuba faced a nationwide blackout on Friday following yet another failure in its national electricity grid, officials confirmed.

"In DOGE shock, Harvard to Caltech hit brakes on hiring",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-doge-shock-harvard-to-caltech-hit-brakes-on-hiring/articleshow/119027469.cms,"Harvard University is imposing a temporary freeze on hiring faculty. Columbia University is grappling with cuts to $400 million in federal funding. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is leaving postdoctoral positions unfilled. A University of Washington researcher is wondering about a climate and health grant after a govt site was taken offline.These are just some of the disruptions that resulted from President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to the federal govt. Though the private sector has historically provided more funding for research and development in the US, experts say, Trump's mass firings and freezing of billions of dollars appropriated by Congress could have ripple effects on the US scientific enterprise for years to come.Many personnel and financial cuts are being made under the banner of streamlining govt - an idea championed by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE - while some funding cancellations and threats are tied to allegations of antisemitism on campus. Several of these moves have been challenged in court, and the implementation of some have been put on hold. But research has already been halted in some places and thrust others into limbo, according to interviews with more than 25 professors, graduate students, other academic researchers, and experts across the public, private and non-profit sectors.The cutbacks risk slowing the pipeline of US-grown science talent, experts warn. ""This is an ecosystem that benefits everyone and has kept the US at the forefront,"" Fiona Harrison, the chair of Caltech's division of physics, mathematics and astronomy, writes in an email.The govt has been an essential source of data for fields from weather to health. Investment in the National Weather Service (NWS) and its support functions, for example, has enabled the growth of a commercial weather forecasting industry. Those systems generate at least $85 billion in economic benefits, or more than 20 times what the govt spends, according to Jeffrey Lazo, an independent economist who tracks the value of US forecasting services.As individual researchers wrestle with funding restrictions, US universities are responding by limiting spending in ways that will impact operations over the coming calendar years. Harvard, Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all recently announced hiring freezes. Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins University is cutting almost 2,000 positions globally and about 250 in the US following the termination of more than $800 million in US Agency for International Development grants. The university is the top recipient of research funding and NIH money.A drop in graduate students would also result in a shallower pool of experts for the biotech industry to hire, says Northwestern University stem cell biologist and NIH grant recipient Carole LaBonne. As uncertainty grips US research institutions, other countries are trying to poach American talent. At least one French university is pitching itself as a ""safe place for science."" China, too, has been ramping up recruitment.","Research has already been halted in some places and thrust others into limbo, according to interviews with more than 25 professors, graduate students, other academic researchers, and experts across the public, private and non-profit sectors.

COPENHAGEN: The United States has reached out to Denmark and other European nations asking if they can export eggs as Americans face surging egg prices, the Nordic country's egg association said on Friday.The request from the US department of agriculture coincides with a raft of new US tariffs on countries, including in Europe, and the threat of more.

Trump promised to lower egg prices on his first day in office but prices increased 59% on a year-on-year basis in Feb, the first full month of his administration.A letter reviewed by Reuters showed that a representative of US department of agriculture in Europe had sent formal inquiries to egg producing countries in late Feb seeking information on their ability and willingness to export eggs to the American market.""We're still waiting to get more guidance from Washington on next steps, but do you have an estimate of the number of eggs that could be supplied to the United States (assuming they meet all the import requirements),"" a follow-up letter to the Danish egg association in early March said. ""Washington is trying to get an estimate of the amount they could feasibly source,"" said the letter, received last week.The Danish Egg Association said they would look into it but that there is no surplus of eggs in Europe. ""There is a shortage of eggs everywhere on a global scale because consumption is increasing and many are affected by bird flu,"" he added.The spokesperson said they had requested more details on the conditions of such an agreement, highlighting that egg exports to the US were challenging due to regulations related to hygiene and other factors.Turkey said in Feb it had started exporting around 15,000 tonnes of eggs to the United States. US department of agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced the plan to seek imported eggs as part of a $1 billion effort to combat the bird flu.

What is the US government shutdown?

Senate Democrats weigh GOP stopgap bill as government shutdown looms

The US government will attempt to prevent a shutdown on Friday, which will take effect if the Senate fails to pass the continuing resolution for funding.The bill which sailed through the Congress faces a tough battle in the Senate with the GOP needing at least eight Democrat votes.Democrats oppose the bill, arguing that it grants President Donald Trump excessive control over spending decisions. They face a choice between blocking it or allowing a government funding lapse.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, however, made it clear on Thursday that he will not allow a government shutdown. ""While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,"" Schumer said.In US, a government shutdown occurs when a funding gap forces the partial or full closure of federal agencies and operations.Government shutdowns typically happen when lawmakers fail to agree on budget allocations before the current funding cycle expires.The US government is at risk of a shutdown starting at 11.59 pm on Friday (local time) unless Congress can reach an agreement on funding.If an agreement isn’t reached by then, federal employees could be furloughed without pay, though some will still be required to work. Federal contractors, however, will not be obligated to work and are not assured back pay for the duration of the shutdown, according to ABC news.Certain ""mandatory"" programs will continue operating. Social Security and Medicare payments will still be distributed, as they are classified as mandatory spending.Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) warned that a government shutdown would give the president greater control over federal operations. ""If you shut down the government, the president is the person who decides what is essential,"" he said, as quoted by the New York Post. ""He decides what part of the government stays open, so you are actually giving him even more power,"" he added.","The US government is at risk of a shutdown starting at 11.59 pm on Friday (local time) unless Congress can reach an agreement on funding.

"Watch: SpaceX, Nasa launches new crew to ISS, paving way for return of Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-spacex-nasa-launches-new-crew-to-iss-paving-way-for-return-of-suni-williams-butch-wilmore/articleshow/119026018.cms,"NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 Launch (Official NASA Broadcast)

SpaceX launched a fresh crew to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday night, setting the stage for Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.The new team—Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov—blasted off from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX capsule as part of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program. Their arrival, expected late Saturday, will allow them to replace the existing crew, including Williams, Wilmore, Nasa’s Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The transition will enable Wilmore and Williams to hand over operations before their scheduled departure next week, pending weather conditions.Wilmore and Williams originally launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner capsule in June for what was meant to be a short test mission. However, technical issues, including helium leaks and thruster failures, forced Nasa to delay their return, eventually deciding to bring them back on a SpaceX mission. Their homecoming was further postponed due to battery repairs on a new SpaceX capsule, prompting the agency to use a refurbished one to speed up the process.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams continued ISS maintenance, including fixing a toilet, watering plants, and conducting experiments. Williams also set a record for the most spacewalking time by a female astronaut.The delay became politically charged when President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed the previous administration had stalled the astronauts' return. However, Wilmore and Williams have consistently backed Nasa’s decision-making.With their return now imminent, both astronauts expressed excitement about reuniting with their families. Wilmore, a church elder, looks forward to resuming in-person ministry, while Williams is eager to walk her Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention … but I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.","Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.

Why Democrats backed down



Trump praises Schumer

WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday managed to avert a government shutdown with hours to spare for the midnight deadline, as the Democrats dropped plans to block a funding bill supported by Donald Trump , and voted to keep the lights on through September.The backing down by the Democrats cleared the path for the bill to be approved by the Senate, dominated by the US President-led Republicans. The proposal, drafted by the Republicans, was passed earlier this week by the House.Ted Cruz, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, accused the Democrats of attempting to 'delay the inevitable.'""In their typical fashion, Senate Democrats engaged in political theater to delay the inevitable and cause instability,"" Cruz said.""Americans voted for change under President Trump and Republican leadership after four years of chaos. The government is funded, let's get back to work,"" he added.Ahead of the crunch vote, Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the upper chamber, shocked his rank and file by announcing he would back the proposal.Despite pressure from their own grassroots to defy Trump, 10 Democrats, apprehensive they could be blamed over a shutdown with no obvious exit to it, backed down, and allowed the bill to advance to a final floor vote, where it only needed Republican support.Earlier, Schumer had warned a shutdown could play into the hands of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, and distract from DOGE's most unpopular actions, which now include firing half the Education Department's workforce.""Under a shutdown, the Trump administration would have wide-ranging authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff members with no promise they would ever be rehired,"" Schumer wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times defending his decision to support the package.This was not enough to pacify the grassroots Democrats, who accused the veteran campaigner of 'betrayal' and 'caving.'More than 100 demonstrators gathered early outside Schumer's Brooklyn residence and raised slogans against him and the Democrats.Meanwhile, taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump praised Schumer for having 'guts.'""I appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing. Really, I'm very impressed by that,"" he told reporters later.(With AFP inputs)","US averts government shutdown with hours to spare for midnight deadline.

Who is Ranjani Srinivasan? Why did the US revoke the Indian scholar's visa?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-ranjani-srinivasan-why-did-the-us-revoke-the-indian-scholars-visa/articleshow/119028610.cms,"Screeengrab

Who is Ranjani Srinivasan?

Ranjani is an Indian national and doctoral student at Columbia University.

She is accused of being involved in activities supporting Hamas.

She is a Fulbright scholar with a strong academic background.

She holds an M.Phil in Urban Planning from Columbia University, a Master’s in Design from Harvard University, and a Bachelor’s in Design from CEPT University, India.

Her research is on land-labour relations in peri-urban India, political economy, and spatial politics.

Why was her visa revoked?

The US government accused Ranjani of advocating for violence and terrorism, through her support of Hamas

Her visa was cancelled by the US Department of State on March 5, 2025, due to ""security concerns.""

The revocation is part of a wider crackdown on foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism in the US.

Another student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested for overstaying her visa. She had previously been detained in 2024 for participating in protests at Columbia University.

Also, the arrest and potential deportation of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, has sparked national outrage and raised concerns about the rights of green card holders in the US.

President Donald Trump has warned that colleges failing to align with his policies could lose federal funding. His targets range from transgender athletes in women's sports to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. On Friday, his administration announced investigations into 52 universities as part of its crackdown on DEI initiatives.

The administration has also withdrawn $400 million in federal grants and contracts, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Ranjani Srinivasan , an Indian doctoral student at Columbia University , has ""self-deported"" after her visa was revoked.The US government accused her of supporting Hamas and advocating violence. Her visa was cancelled on March 5, 2025, and she used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that living and studying in the US is a privilege and should not be extended to those who support terrorism.“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathisers use the CBP Home App to self-deport,” she said.","Ranjani Srinivasan is an Indian national and doctoral student at Columbia University.

The plane had been diverted mid-flight due to engine vibrations before landing safely.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the American Airlines flight 1006 was traveling from Colorado Springs to Dallas-Fort Worth when the crew reported engine trouble. Upon landing in Denver at around 5:15 p.m., an engine caught fire as the plane taxied to the gate.Passengers scrambled to exit, some using slides while others climbed onto the left wing as black smoke billowed from the right-side engine. “I chose to stay calm,” passenger Hani Levi, a former military airplane mechanic, said. She described thick smoke filling the cabin as some passengers panicked. “A mother screamed that she needed to get off with her two children, one of whom tried to run toward the front of the plane.”Another passenger, Daniel Friedman, recalled the chaos. “Really, I just wanted to make sure we got here safe and didn’t know if it was going to happen or not,” he told WRAL-TV. “I don’t wish that upon anybody.”Twelve passengers were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, according to airport officials. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched an investigation into the incident. American Airlines thanked first responders and crew members for their swift action but did not clarify the exact cause of the fire. The damaged plane was later seen parked behind a hangar at the airport.A replacement aircraft transported passengers to Dallas-Fort Worth, arriving early Friday morning. Aviation experts said engine fires are rare but typically not catastrophic. “A pilot going to work for an airline today could likely fly for 30 years and never experience an engine failure,” said Steven Wallace, a former FAA accident investigations director.The incident comes amid growing concerns over air travel safety following a series of recent aviation mishaps, including a Japan Airlines plane clipping a parked Delta jet in Seattle and a Toronto flight overturning upon landing. However, former NTSB Chairman James Hall cautioned against drawing conclusions. “Given the past history, you can classify it as unusual,” he said, “but I don’t know if you have enough information to draw any conclusions.”Boeing declined to comment on the incident, while CFM International, the engine manufacturer, did not immediately respond to inquiries. The FAA and NTSB will continue investigating the cause of the fire.",A Boeing 737-800 carrying 172 passengers and six crew members caught fire while taxiing to a gate at Denver International Airport.

""Here's the thing. The cameras are all on; anything I say, no matter how crazy, she has to smile, laugh, and celebrate it,"" JD Vance said as Usha Vance actually smiled and laughed.Social media went berserk at the comment and started advising Usha to run from her marriage with JD.""His attempt at humor is always tasteles...or is that just me?"" one wrote.""That sounds like a threat.

USAID Classified Documents: Judge won't block destruction of old USAID classified documents as the building is cleaned out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-wont-block-destruction-of-old-usaid-classified-documents-as-the-building-is-cleaned-out/articleshow/119019458.cms,"Judge won't block destruction of old USAID classified documents as the building is cleaned out (Picture credit: AP)

WASHINGTON: A federal judge refused Friday to block the destruction of classified documents as part of the building cleanout at the US agency for international development, finding that records slated for shredding or burning are old or no longer needed.The documents don't appear to be related to the ongoing court battles over the near-dismantling of USAID by the Trump administration, US district judge Carl Nichols found as he refused to grant a temporary restraining order.A second federal judge is expected to consider a separate lawsuit over the document destruction Friday afternoon.The cases come as the Trump administration dismantles USAID , cutting off most federal money and terminating 83% of humanitarian and development programs abroad. All but a few hundred staffers are being pulled off the job and the agency's Washington headquarters is being shut down.A union for USAID contractors had asked Nichols, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump, to intervene to stop the destruction of possible evidence after an email ordering staffers to help burn and shred agency records became public.The Trump administration said the email had been taken out of context as trained USAID staff cleared out the agency's building. The classified documents slated for destruction were largely copies of those held by other agencies or derived from other classified material, Erica Carr, acting executive secretary at USAID, said in court documents.Any personnel records or those related to current classified programs are being retained, she said.She also pledged to contact the plaintiffs before any more documents are destroyed.The collection, retention and disposal of classified material and federal records are closely regulated by federal law.The classified documents at USAID emerged as an issue last month when the Trump administration put the agency's top two security officials on leave after they refused to grant members of Elon Musk's government-cutting teams access to classified material.",Judge won't block destruction of old USAID classified documents as the building is cleaned out.

Foreign weapons, deadly assault

Terror links & Kurram crackdown

Compensation & safe city project

Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed announced on Friday. The development comes as investigators analyze CCTV footage and forensic evidence to track the origins of the attackers.The Bannu attack, which claimed the lives of five soldiers and 13 civilians, involved foreign weapons and a well-planned assault. Investigators have traced the vehicles used and are working to determine how the attackers infiltrated the region. Sixteen militants were killed during the attack, but questions remain about their network and handlers.Meanwhile, a powerful blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania, a renowned madrassa in Akora Khattak, left a top cleric and four worshippers dead, with several others injured.Authorities are probing whether the suicide bombers had links outside Pakistan and how they managed to cross borders undetected. In a separate operation, security forces arrested over 100 suspects linked to recent violence in Kurram, an area plagued by sectarian and militant activity.Acknowledging the role of terrorism in the Kurram violence, IG Hameed assured that a new security strategy was being developed to prevent further attacks. He expressed confidence that ""sustainable peace will soon be established.""Families of the Bannu attack victims have been given PKR 1 million each in compensation. In a broader move to tighten security, authorities have approved the Safe City Project, expected to be completed within months.As investigations continue, Pakistan remains on high alert, with officials bracing for further threats amid rising militant activity.","Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks.

A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.According to the news agency ANI, the blast occurred at 1:45 pm (local time) at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque on Azam Warsak Bypass Road. According to district police officer (DPO) Asif Bahader, the improvised explosive device (IED) was planted inside the mosque’s pulpit, reported Dawn.""In the explosion, Abdullah Nadeem, the district chief of JUI, was seriously wounded,"" Bahader told Dawn. He added that three other injured individuals—Rehmanullah, Mullah Noor and Shah Behran—sustained minor injuries.All victims were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for medical treatment.""The police have also reached the site of the blast and are collecting evidence,"" Bahader said, adding that an investigation was underway.According to ANI, mosques in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have frequently been targeted, particularly during Friday prayers, when large congregations gather.Just last month, a suicide blast killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others at the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Nowshera.In a deadlier attack on January 30, 2023, a bomb ripped through a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines area, killing at least 59 people and injuring 157 others, as per Dawn. The death toll later rose to 101, according to the KP health department. The suicide bomber detonated the explosives inside the mosque, collapsing parts of the prayer hall while nearly 400 worshippers, mostly police officers, were present.Similarly, in 2022, a suicide bombing at Jamia Masjid Koocha Risaldar in Peshawar’s old city killed multiple worshippers. The bomber first shot police personnel at the mosque’s entrance before detonating himself inside the hall where a large congregation was offering Friday prayers, reported Dawn.Security officials in South Waziristan have begun examining the blast site to determine who was responsible for planting the IED inside the mosque. While no group has claimed responsibility yet, authorities remain concerned about the rising attacks on religious places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.

In the desert town of Mithi, Pakistan, an extraordinary display of religious harmony unfolded as Hindus prepared meals for fasting Muslims, while the Muslim community welcomed a Holi procession, marking a rare moment of unity in a country often marred by religious discrimination.According to AFP, while religious tensions are prevalent across Muslim-majority Pakistan, Mithi, a city in Sindh province with rolling sand dunes and mud-brick homes, stands as an exception.The city, home to around 60,000 people, is one of the few places in Pakistan where Hindus form the majority.""All the traditions and rituals here are celebrated together,"" said Raj Kumar, a 30-year-old Hindu businessman. ""On Holi, Hindu youth are joined by Muslim youth, celebrating together and applying colours on each other"", Kumar added.This year, Holi and the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan coincided, bringing both communities closer. Hundreds of Hindus took part in a procession through the streets of Mithi, where they were warmly received by Muslim neighbours at the city square, reported AFP.""We have learned to live together since childhood. This has come to us through generations, and we are following it too,"" said Mohan Lal Mali, a 53-year-old Hindu resident, who arranged a meal for Muslims to break their fast.Muslim cleric Babu Aslam Qaimkhani, while applying Holi powder to Hindu MP Mahesh Kumar Malani, revealed the close bond between the communities and said, ""Today, you might not see colours on me, but in the past, they would drench me in colours.""According to AFP, the local imam even includes both faiths in his prayers, ending the call for prayer with, “Peace to Hindus and Muslims.”Mithi remains unique in Pakistan, where freedom of religion is often threatened. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, religious violence and discrimination are on the rise and state authorities often fail to control unrest.However, Mithi has seen little religious violence, and even during Hindu celebrations, there is no need for armed security, unlike in other parts of Pakistan, AFP noted. Muslims and Hindus vote for each other, and there are no beef shops in the city out of respect for Hindu beliefs.Instead, Muslims sacrifice only goats during festivals.""There are no divisions among us. We all are humans, and we all are equal,"" said Amaan Ullah, a 19-year-old Muslim labourer.Despite this peaceful coexistence, residents fear an outside influence might disrupt the harmony. The city's remote location in the Tharparkar desert shielded it from Partition violence in 1947, when India and Pakistan were created.However, as Mithi develops, an influx of outsiders has introduced radical elements into the city.A large banner for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a radical Islamist group that champions blasphemy laws, now hangs in the city’s central square, AFP reported.""People coming from outside the city are causing some doubt and a slight sense of fear,"" said Padma Lodha, a Hindu school headmistress.For now, though, Mithi remains a rare symbol of interfaith harmony, where Muslims, Hindus, and even Christians coexist, celebrating their traditions side by side.","Holi and the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan coincided, bringing both communities closer.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement on Friday rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighboour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'During a press briefing on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan presented evidence of calls traced to Afghanistan regarding the hijacking. When questioned about Pakistan's stance shift from India to Afghanistan concerning terrorist attacks, he maintained their position, stating there was no policy change and reaffirmed their belief in India's involvement in terrorism against Pakistan.Since Tuesday's attack, Pakistan's military, government and media allies have implicitly suggested Indian involvement in the train assault, whilst overlooking significant security lapses by their military and intelligence services.MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Meanwhile, Afghanistan's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement rejecting Pakistan's claims, urging them to address their internal security concerns rather than making unfounded accusations.The Jaffar Express incident on March 11, involving over 450 passengers, resulted in 58 fatalities, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organisation.Pakistan consistently accuses India of supporting groups like the BLA to create unrest in Balochistan, allegations that New Delhi firmly denies.The Balochistan insurgency, rooted in local issues of poverty and political marginalisation, has continued for decades. Indo-Pakistani relations, which deteriorated following the 2019 Pulwama attack, continue to be strained with minimal prospects for diplomatic engagement.","Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan.

Militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours. The Pakistani military later announced on Wednesday that a successful rescue operation had ended the standoff, freeing the hostages and eliminating over 30 militants.Earlier on Tuesday, Mehboob Hussain was travelling when an explosion damaged the tracks beneath the front carriage. The nine-coach Jaffar Express came to a stop in the isolated Bolan Pass of central Pakistan, an area devoid of internet and mobile connectivity. Subsequently, gunfire erupted.""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Hussain told BBC Urdu. He and roughly 440 fellow passengers were travelling from Quetta to Peshawar through Balochistan province when armed militants launched their attack, bombing the tracks, shooting at the train and boarding the carriages.Officials report that 300 passengers have been rescued, whilst 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel lost their lives. However, fate of several passengers remains uncertain, with reports from Reuters and AFP suggesting some militants departed with an unknown number of hostages.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province, quickly claimed responsibility for the train hijacking, threatening to kill hostages unless Pakistani authorities released Baloch political prisoners.BBC interviewed several witnesses who recounted the terrifying events aboard the train during the attack. ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor a passenger said.A railway police officer aboard the train told the outlet that, contrary to initial official statements, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" during the attack.The BLA has shared purported footage of the train explosion. The video displays an exposed track section alongside a substantial rocky incline. The footage shows BLA fighters positioned at the summit of this incline.The officer detailed to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to resist the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, speaking anonymously, stated.He mentioned being accompanied by four railway police and two Frontier Corps (FC) paramilitary members. ""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained.""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless,"" he added.After the gunfire from the Jaffar Express subsided, armed militants descended from the mountains and began evacuating passengers. The officer described how they conducted identity checks and segregated hostages based on their ethnicity alongside the train.According to the passengers, the militants issued threats speaking in Balochi stating their demands to the government and warning of severe consequences, including burning the vehicle if their demands weren't met. The officer noted that the militants received instructions to execute people, targeting both military personnel and civilians from the segregated groups.The militants permitted certain groups to leave unharmed, including women, children, elderly individuals and Balochistan residents, according to Noor.Noor Muhammad, who was amongst those released, described how armed men entered the train after an hour of gunfire, demanding passengers to exit under threat.Muhammad and his wife were escorted off the train and instructed to walk straight ahead without looking back. They reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900 after a challenging journey through wilderness. His wife recounted their rescue by Pakistan military personnel who transported them safely to Machh and subsequently to their waiting children in Quetta.The police official, speaking anonymously, described how numerous BLA militants began departing as night fell. ""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.Violence erupted again around 10pm when some attempted to flee. ""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official added.Mehboob another passenger further recounted continuous gunfire throughout the night and described how a person near him, a father of five daughters, was shot.""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.Another passenger, Allahditta, recounted how the BLA killed his cousin before his eyes. He mentioned that his cousin begged for his life, citing his young daughters, but ""his life was not spared"".The rescue operation began during Wednesday morning prayers when FC forces engaged the militants. Amidst the chaos, several hostages managed to escape.The police official described fleeing with his injured companion, carrying him beyond the firing range with assistance from another person. Mehboob, Allahdita, the police official and his companion survived the ordeal during the FC's intervention.The Balochistan Liberation Army has been fighting for an independent Baloch state and has intensified attacks in recent years, targeting security forces, infrastructure, and foreign investments, particularly Chinese projects.While the group has a history of attacking military camps, railway stations, and trains, this marked the first time they had hijacked a train.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp in Jandola area of Tank district, in the country’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Thursday, killing 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The assault on the FC (a paramilitary force), which began with a massive explosion and turned into a fierce gun battle, marks the second major militant attack in Pakistan this week, underscoring growing security threats in the region.The attack commenced in the early hours when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives near the perimeter of Jandola base in the restive tribal district near the Afghan border. The blast tore through the camp’s defences, paving the way for an armed assault by TTP fighters. Security forces responded swiftly, engaging the attackers in a prolonged exchange of heavy gunfire. By mid-morning, the military declared the situation under control, reporting that all assailants had been neutralised.“The brave soldiers of the Frontier Corps stood their ground and eliminated the threat with precision,” said a spokesperson for the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Ten terrorists were sent to their deaths in this operation, proving once again our resolve to protect the nation.”While official statements did not disclose casualties among security personnel or civilians, unverified reports circulating on social media platforms, including X, suggested significant damage to the camp and hinted at dozens of potential casualties. Authorities have yet to confirm these claims, and details remain scarce as the area has been cordoned off.The TTP, a militant group seeking to overthrow Pakistani governance in the tribal regions, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. The assault comes just two days after another deadly attack in Balochistan, where Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked the Jaffar Express train, killing 21 hostages and four soldiers before being eliminated by security forces.Analysts see the Jandola attack as part of a broader resurgence of militancy in Pakistan’s border regions, fuelled by instability in neighbouring Afghanistan and the TTP’s renewed aggression. “This is a clear escalation,” said security expert Ayesha Khan in Islamabad. “The TTP is testing the military’s defences, and the proximity to the Afghan border only complicates the response.”Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion followed by hours of gunfire, with some describing the scene as chaotic. “We hid in our homes, praying it would end soon,” said Javed Khan, a shopkeeper near Jandola. “The army fought hard, but it’s a reminder that we’re never far from danger here.”",Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp. 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed.

ISLAMABAD: Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down after the 17-member Afghan delegation walked out, accusing Pakistan of not taking the negotiations seriously, official sources said on Thursday.The cross-border movement of people via Torkham border crossing, a critical trade and transit point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was abruptly suspended on Feb 21 after Pakistani and Afghan security forces developed differences over construction activities on both sides of the border. The situation worsened this month when eight people, including six troops, were injured after Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces traded fire at the border. A number of houses, a mosque and some clearing agents’ offices were hit by artillery, and cross-border firing continued for three days.To address the issue, both sides had formed their jirgas — traditional assemblies of tribal elders and representatives — which held its first meeting this week in which both sides agreed to a ceasefire. The talks, however, broke down on Wednesday when the Afghan delegation, led by Younus Mohmand, chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, walked out.The Afghan delegation was surprised to find that Pakistan had expanded its delegation list without prior consultation. Instead of the agreed 17 members, Pakistan presented a list of 70 individuals, many of whom the Afghan side considered irrelevant to negotiations.After waiting two hours for a response, the Afghan jirga left for Kabul, expressing frustration with Pakistan’s approach. Mohmand criticised Pakistan’s actions, stating that the addition of unrelated individuals reflected a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute.The collapse of talks highlights the fragile state of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations , especially over border issues like the Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not officially recognise. Pakistani customs officials at Torkham said the border closure was causing a loss of around $1.5 million daily as exports to Afghanistan have stopped. Additionally, $2 million in revenue has been lost due to suspension of imports from Afghanistan.","Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down.

However, the BLA accused the military of misleading the public, according to a Reuters report.

He condemned the rising threat of militancy, calling it an existential danger to Pakistan.“Pakistan’s peace and prosperity are linked with eradicating terrorism. There will be no prosperity without peace,” he said at a high-level meeting.Death toll figures have varied, with the military reporting that “21 innocent hostages” and four soldiers were killed in the operation. However, a railway official in Balochistan said that 25 bodies were retrieved from the scene and transported to the nearby town of Mach.“Deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified,” an anonymous railway official told AFP.A senior local military officer overseeing the operation confirmed these details.Passengers who survived the ordeal shared chilling testimonies of the massacre.

DHAKA: Amid growing protests against attacks on women and rising incidents of rape, Bangladesh police on Thursday imposed restrictions on all kinds of meetings, rallies, gatherings, processions and showdowns in key locations for an indefinite period.Areas under restriction include the official residence of chief adviser Mohammad Yunus, the secretariat and nearby locations. Bangladesh has witnessed intensified demonstrations in recent days, with protesters demanding resignation of the home adviser for failure to ensure safety and security of citizens, especially women and girls.Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council issued a press note stating that 92 incidents of violence targeting minorities and indigenous peoples occurred in the first two months of this year. It is worth noting that in the five months — from Aug 4 to Dec 31 of last year — there were 2,184 attacks targeting minorities, the group said.","Bangladesh police impose restrictions on all kinds of meetings, rallies, gatherings, processions and showdowns in key locations for an indefinite period.

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18.

LONDON: The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to be certified to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.The Indian authorities are seeking to extradite Bhandari (62), a defence middleman residing in London, to face criminal charges of money laundering and wilfully evading taxes in India by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income on his Indian income tax returns, claiming he evaded Rs 197 crore in taxes, contrary to Sec 51 of the Black Money Act.In the tax years 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 Bhandari, an Indian national, declared he had nil foreign assets despite having amassed Rs 731 crore of foreign assets, the charges state.On Feb 28 two high court judges, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn, ordered Bhandari’s discharge on two grounds, namely that his extradition him to India would be a breach of both Articles 3 (torture) and 6 (fair trial) of the ECHR ( European Convention on Human Rights ).The judges said he would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by violence, from other prisoners, and also from prison officials inside Tihar jail — where he would be detained — as he was “perceived to be rich”.They commented that “incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly” in Tihar jail and the risk was not removed by India’s assurances, amounting to an ECHR Article 3 breach.They also said because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, this was a flagrant denial of his rights under Article 6.A high court official told TOI: “An application was filed on Wednesday by the respondent (Indian govt) to certify two points of law of general public importance; and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to those two questions.”TOI understands that Delhi’s argument is that reversing the burden of proof is not a “flagrant denial of justice” as per Article 6. Delhi also claims that it should have been asked to provide further assurances about Bhandari’s treatment in Tihar jail rather than the extradition being turned down under Article 3.Bhandari, represented by Edward Fitzgerald KC, had appealed in the high court under six grounds, but the other four grounds were dismissed.","The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.

LONDON: UK’s govt is to abolish the £200 billion NHS England to cut bureaucracy and duplication with the department of health and bring it back under govt control, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced in a speech on Thursday.Starmer said this would shift money back to the front line and bring the NHS “back into democratic control”. “That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations and GP appointments”, not on an arms-length body, he said.“By abolishing NHS England, that will put the NHS back at the heart of govt where it belongs, freeing it to focus on patients with less bureaucracy and more money for nurses,” he explained.The news follows the departure of senior leaders at NHS England in recent weeks, including NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard.Health secretary Wes Streeting told the Commons that NHS England was “the biggest quango in the world” and there were twice as many staff in NHS England and the health department as in 2010 when the NHS had the shortest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction.“Today NHS delivers worse care for patients but is more expensive than ever before,” Streeting said. “The budget for NHS England staff has soared to £2 billion.”“Such bloated and inefficient bureaucracy cannot be justified. Frontline NHS staff are drowning in micromanagement subjected to by vast layers of bureaucracy,” he said.Streeting said there are 15,300 staff in NHS England and 3,300 in the department of health and social care. “Across both we’re looking to reduce the overall headcount by 50%. That will deliver hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings.” It will mean “fewer checkers and more doers”, he said.Integration of NHS England and his department has begun and will be complete in two years. The Tories welcomed the announcement.But Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), was taken aback by the decision which he said had been taken without consulting staff and questioned whether it had been done with proper thought.“There have been several reorganisations of the NHS over the years and bureaucracy creeps in all the time. It is a sad state of affairs that every new govt brings changes and there is no continuity.” He agreed the NHS was in the worst state it has ever been, with long waiting times and huge patient dissatisfaction, and said workforce management was “chaotic”.“Will abolishing NHS England resolve all this? If politicians run the NHS, that is not good news. It should be run by professionals. The issue is it never has enough money,” Mehta said.",UK's govt is to abolish the £200 billion NHS England to cut bureaucracy and duplication.

UK’s Queen Camilla sent a private letter of support to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot , recognising her “extraordinary dignity and courage”, reported Newsweek quoting a palace aide.""She was tremendously affected by the Madame Pelicot case in France and that lady’s extraordinary dignity and courage as she put herself in the public eye,"" a palace source was quoted as saying by the news outlet. ""Because, as she rightly put it, why should she be made to feel like a victim or hide away in shame?”, the source added.According to Newsweek, The Queen wanted to reach out personally to acknowledge Pelicot’s resilience and the impact she has made in highlighting a significant societal issue.""So, as a long-term supporter of survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, the Queen wrote to Madame Pelicot privately. It was very much her instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level,"" the source said.Pelicot, 72, endured nearly a decade of horrific abuse at the hands of her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, who drugged, raped, and filmed her, while also enlisting dozens of other men to do the same.The abuse, which occurred between 2011 and 2020, was uncovered when Dominique was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities discovered a hard drive containing over 200 videos documenting the crimes.Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2024 after standing trial alongside 50 co-defendants, most of whom were also convicted of rape or sexual assault. The scale of the abuse made it France’s largest-ever rape trial, drawing widespread media attention.Gisèle Pelicot made headlines for waiving her anonymity and choosing to face her 51 alleged rapists in court. She explained her decision as an effort to make the ""shame swap sides"", ensuring that perpetrators, not victims, carried the stigma of sexual violence. Her bravery earned her praise across France and internationally, with supporters lining up outside the court to applaud her and present her with flowers, BBC reported.Queen Camilla has been an active advocate against domestic and sexual violence for years. In November, ITV aired a documentary following her campaign work, where she urged for a cultural shift to end violence against women and open conversations on abuse.She has also visited numerous charities supporting survivors. In February, she visited Brave Spaces in Exeter, England, which is a two-year test and learn project and supports women facing multiple disadvantages, homelessness, trauma, and domestic and sexual violence. There she met women rebuilding their lives after domestic violence.""The Queen is a great advocate for women,"" Newsweek quoted Afnan Tellesy, 37, after meeting Camilla at the charity.","Queen Camilla writes to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot in a gesture of support.

What is NHS England?

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Thursday that NHS England will be abolished, bringing the National Health Service (NHS) back under direct government control.“I’m bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control, by abolishing the arms-length body NHS England,” Starmer said.In a speech, he explained: ""We're going to cut bureaucracy across the state. Focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line.""He further said, ""Amongst the reasons we're abolishing it is because of the duplication. So if you can believe it, we've got a communications team in NHS England, we've got a communications team in the health department of government. We've got a strategy team in NHS England, a strategy team in the government department. We're duplicating things that could be done once. If we strip that out, which is what we're doing today, that then allows us to free up that money, to put it where it needs to be, which is the front line.""Also read: NHS England announces large-scale cuts as part of government shake-up Starmer arugued that politicians should oversee the NHS rather than an independent body.

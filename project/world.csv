NEW DELHI: The Pentagon in its annual report to the US Congress on China's military expansion said that Beijing is pushing ""to modernize, diversify, and expand its nuclear forces rapidly"".The report said that China's stockpile of operational nuclear warheads has increased from more than 500 to over 600 in 2024 and it will reach up to 1,000by 2030.Citing intelligence and open source data, the report added that China would be able to ""target more US cities, military facilities, and leadership sites than ever before in a potential nuclear conflict"".Beijing is also developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that will ""significantly improve"" its nuclear-capable missile forces and require increased nuclear warhead production, the Pentagon in its report said.The country also ""probably completed"" the construction of three new silo fields in 2022, which would contain at least 300 new ICBM silos where it has loaded some of the missiles.Beijing may also be exploring the development of conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems that could threaten the United States, it added.The report said that the Chinese navy has more than 370 ships and submarines, up from the approximately 340 that the Pentagon said China had in its 2022 report.The Pentagon also warned about the growing capabilities of the Chinese navy and said that it has continued to grow its ability to perform missions beyond the first island chain including Japan's Okinawa, Taiwan and Philippines.The People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s air force is ""rapidly approaching technology"" up to US standards, the report said.It is ""modernising and indigenising"" its aircraft, as well as unmanned aerial systems.Pentagon suggested that Beijing is looking to expand its overseas infrastructure and logistics to project and sustain military power at greater distances"" beyond its base in Djibouti.The PLA has likely considered having military logistics facilities in countries from Myanmar, Pakistan and Bangladesh to Kenya and Nigeria, among others.A global Chinese military logistics network could ""disrupt"" US operations, the report added.China ""amplified"" its diplomatic, political and military pressure against Taiwan in 2023, the report said.The country ""continued to erode longstanding norms in and around Taiwan by employing a range of pressure tactics"", it added.Citing data from Taiwan's ministry of national defense, the Pentagon reported an increase in Chinese airplanes crossing the Taiwan Strait centerline in 2023.","The Pentagon in its annual report to the US Congress on China's military expansion said that Beijing is pushing ""to modernize, diversify, and expand its nuclear forces rapidly"" China's stockpile of operational nuclear warheads has increased from more than 500 to over 600 in 2024 and it will reach up to 1,000by 2030.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116487033,imgsize-1237405,width-400,resizemode-4/116487033.jpg"
Pakistan developing missiles that could eventually hit US: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pakistan-developing-missiles-that-could-eventually-hit-us-official/articleshow/116486559.cms,"White House flags Pakistan's missile advances

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Economic impact

A spending bill supported by Donald Trump was rejected in the US House of Representatives, as numerous Republicans defied the president-elect.The package failed by a vote of 174-235 just hours after it was hastily assembled by Republican leaders seeking to comply with Trump's demands. A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world's richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.Now the United States government is racing toward a shutdown, just days before Christmas, as Trump and Musk scuttled a cross-party deal to keep federal agencies running. With the Friday midnight deadline approaching, millions of Americans, including federal workers, are bracing for disruptions that could stretch into the holiday season. Federal workers, essential services, and the economy as a whole will feel the weight of this impending crisis.A shutdown would likely affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers. An estimated 875,000 could be furloughed, while 1.4 million essential workers, including those in air traffic control and law enforcement, would continue working without pay.The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) warned that these essential workers would face financial strain, as pay is only issued retroactively after the shutdown ends. Contractors, however, may not be guaranteed back pay.The shutdown would significantly disrupt the lives of federal employees. Many of the over 2 million federal workers, including clerical and administrative staff, would face delayed paychecks. This has caused anguish in past shutdowns, with workers struggling to afford basic necessities. Long lines at food banks were reported during the 2018 shutdown, which lasted over a month. In addition, many workers who are furloughed or required to work without pay will not have financial protections, especially contractors like janitors and cafeteria workers.While Social Security and Medicare benefits will continue uninterrupted, certain government services will be affected. National Park Service (NPS) sites, including parks and monuments, would close to visitors, as seen in previous shutdowns. Similarly, inspections of critical infrastructure, like chemical factories and water treatment plants, may be paused, leading to concerns about public safety.The US Postal Service will not be impacted, as it operates independently of government funding. However, the shutdown would severely affect other public services, including routine food safety inspections, which may slow down. For some low-income Americans who rely on food assistance programs, like WIC and food stamps, a prolonged shutdown could halt access to benefits.During a shutdown, federal agencies are required to prioritize essential functions. For instance, the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) would keep 50,000 employees working, while furloughing more than 40,000. Critical services, such as the National Institutes of Health’s clinical care and the Food and Drug Administration's monitoring of foodborne illnesses, would continue, but other functions, like routine food safety work, would be reduced to emergency responses.The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with 59,000 out of 62,000 employees deemed essential, would continue screening travelers during the busy holiday season. However, TSA spokesperson Carter Langston warned of possible delays due to higher volumes of passengers and limited staffing.The shutdown could last up to two weeks, a typical pay period for federal employees. Pressure would build for a resolution as workers miss paychecks, causing increasing stress on the federal workforce. A longer shutdown could have broader economic consequences, as shutdowns have historically reduced US economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points, according to Thibault Denamiel of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The longest shutdown in US history occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days under the Trump administration. While markets typically remain stable during shutdowns, experts warn that such disruptions could cause wider economic anxiety.A shutdown’s ripple effect extends beyond federal employees. The broader economy could face a slowdown, with reduced growth and increased uncertainty. Thibault Denamiel noted that private sector impacts could be significant, though markets have proven resilient in the face of past shutdowns. Nonetheless, the potential for a debt default could heighten market anxiety, especially with Trump's upcoming second term, raising concerns about future economic stability.",A spending bill supported by Donald Trump was rejected in the US House of Representatives.

Russia's economy is overheating, says Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is ready for a ""missile duel"" with the United States. He added that this would represent how their latest Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile could easily defeat any American defence system. Addressing the Syrian Civil War, he said that he has not met Assad in Moscow but plans to. During his annual press-conference, he asserted that he is ready to talk to US President-elect Donald Trump.In response to Western doubts about the Oreshnik, Putin recommended that each side should choose a specific target to be safeguarded by American missiles.""We're ready for such an experiment,"" Putin said.Putin additionally noted that whilst the Oreshnik is a contemporary weapon, it incorporates elements from previous Russian missile designs.Russia initially deployed the Oreshnik missile against Dnipro, a Ukrainian city, on November 21, which Putin described as retaliation for Ukraine's inaugural use of American ATACMs ballistic missiles and British Storm Shadows to attack Russian soil with Western authorisation.Putin has indicated his intention to inquire about the whereabouts of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in Syria 12 years ago, during discussions with former Syrian President Bashar Assad. The matter of locating Tice remains a key priority for the Biden administration.Putin confirmed that while he has not yet had a meeting with Assad, who has received asylum in Moscow, he intends to raise the question of Tice's disappearance when they meet.""We also can pose the question to people who control the situation on the ground in Syria,"" Putin said.He acknowledged that Russia's economy is experiencing signs of overheating, leading to concerning levels of inflation.During his annual phone-in session with Russians, Putin expressed support for the central bank's stringent monetary policies, whilst suggesting that more prompt action might have been beneficial.The central bank is anticipated to implement a substantial interest rate increase of 200 basis points to 23% at its Friday meeting, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. This strict monetary approach has faced significant opposition from the business sector.""There are some issues here, namely inflation, a certain overheating of the economy, and the government and the central bank are already tasked with bringing the tempo down,"" said Putin.Prior to the phone-in, Putin revealed his discussion with central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, who projected inflation rates of 9.2%-9.3% for 2024, exceeding the central bank's forecast of 8.5%.Putin indicated that the combination of strict monetary policies and government measures to moderate economic activity would result in reduced growth rates in 2025 compared to this year's 4%.""I think the (growth rate) next year should be somewhere around 2-2.5%, a sort of soft landing in order to maintain macroeconomic indicators,"" Putin concluded.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is ready for a ""missile duel"" with the United States.

Natalie 'Samatha' Rupnow, the 15-year-old suspect in the Wisconsin Abundant Life Christian School shooting, called her parents 'scum' in the alleged manifesto doing the rounds on social media. She described her relationship with her parents as ""extremely difficult"" as she spoke about her loneliness.Court documents now reveal that her parents divorced 10 years ago leading to custody chaos which might have made Natalie's life difficult.According to court documents, Rupnow was placed in the primary care of her mother Mellissa Rupnow following their divorce in 2014. For the next eight years, the parents fought over the custody which also involved a remarriage and a second divorce, and in 2022, the primary custody of Rupnow was earned by the father, Jeffrey Rupnow.The parents got remarried in 2017, according to one document which then asked to set child support to zero and adjust the custody of Nataliue to equal shared placement. The couple filed for a second divorce in 2021 and agreed to a shared placement of Natalie. In a mediated agreement filed in July 2022, Natalie's father Jeffrey was granted primary placement of Natalie and the parents agreed that their goal was to work toward equal placement.A teacher and a student of the school died and six people were injured after Natalie shot up a room filled with study-hall kids before shooting herself. A combination of factors has been blamed for the shooting spree including her very disturbed family life.The cops are also probing an angle of bullying and the exact motive is not yet known. “On the question of bullying, we’re talking to students to understand whether bullying was one of those multiple factors that I mentioned earlier,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said adding that the authenticity of the manifesto was yet to be ascertained.“I’ve grown to hate people, and society, it’s truly not my fault though, it never was. but all of you and the world have done to me is pick and tease me, you’ve pushed me into a corner with no help whatsoever,"" the manifesto read.","Natalie 'Samatha' Rupnow, the 15-year-old suspect in the Wisconsin Abundant Life Christian School shooting, called her parents'scum' in the alleged manifesto.

Federal government shutdowns can be disruptive, with thousands of workers furloughed and most of them not getting paid on time. Taxpayers won’t get calls returned, there may be longer lines at airports during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year and many national parks will close.And yet many of the routine functions of government — things like national defense, benefit checks and mail delivery — continue as usual.The uniquely American phenomenon of the partial government shutdown — a symptom of divided government, a dysfunctional budget process and a constitutional system that requires the House, Senate and president to agree on a spending plan — affects every federal agency differently.In principle, a law dating back to the 19th century prohibits federal agencies from spending money “exceeding an amount available in an appropriation” from Congress. Because Congress usually only appropriates money year-to-year, that means there’s a threat of a shutdown every October 1, when the new fiscal year begins. This year, as in many recent years, Congress passed a short-term extension into December.But there are exceptions. Government agencies responsible for health, safety and protection of property can continue, which includes military personnel, homeland security and food inspections.The president must continue to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. So much of the White House Office, the Office of the Pardon Attorney and the US Trade Representative will remain open.And a number of federal entities — including the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — aren’t funded by annual appropriations from Congress and can continue running off their own funding sources.Good news for those looking to travel by train or send a last-minute package for the holidays: Amtrak and the US Postal Service are also among those entities that will continue operations during the shutdown.The Office of Management and Budget requires every executive agency to submit a contingency plan in the event of a shutdown — technically known as a “lapse in appropriation.” Here are some highlights:About four in 10 federal employees will be furloughed and barred from doing any work under a law that prohibits agencies from accepting volunteer labor. Essential employees will work without pay.High-ranking federal officials confirmed by the Senate are always exempt from furlough.Before the 35-day shutdown that began in December 2018, Congress passed a law codifying the practice of retroactively paying federal workers — both furloughed and essential workers — after the shutdown ends. But paychecks would be suspended in the meantime, often resulting in higher rates of absenteeism.And constitutional officers — like the president, members of Congress and judges — must be paid under the Constitution.The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration provide essential safety functions and would continue. But travelers could still face delays: Air traffic controllers and TSA officers would be without pay, which has led to higher rates of no-shows during past shutdowns.US consulates and passport offices will operate as long as they can on their fees.Most national parks would likely be shuttered, turning away visitors and crippling businesses in the $800 billion outdoor recreation economy. Easily accessible sites would generally remain so but without customary staffing and resources, potentially resulting in uncleaned toilets and increased litter.Museums including the Smithsonian and National Gallery of Art could close in a protracted shutdown.Cemeteries, monuments and visitor centers worldwide housed under the American Battle Monuments Commission would also shutter.The inauguration of a new president is mandated under the Constitution, and would go on even if the lapse in spending lasts to the January 20 event. Congress has already appropriated $3.7 million for inaugural ceremonies, and all of the heightened security around them would be also be exempted from a shutdown. Inaugural balls and other festivities are privately funded through the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, which has already gotten pledges of million-dollar donations from corporate sponsors like Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., and personal support from Citadel Securities’ Ken Griffin and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.Medicare benefits would continue, as would new and continuing Social Security checks. But some administrative actions — things like benefit verifications, corrections to earnings records and replacement cards — would be delayed.The National Institutes of Health’s hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, would remain open to care for current patients, and research activities would continue where shutting them down would disrupt ongoing clinical trials.Safety-net food assistance programs would continue.Medical care at veterans hospitals and clinics would go on, as would suicide prevention programs, medical and prosthetic research and burial benefits.But other benefits for veterans could be delayed, including those for education, job training and loans.Uniformed personnel are exempt from furloughs and would continue to report for duty without pay. Most civilian Defense Department employees would be furloughed.The Pentagon could continue many contracting activities to support service members under a Civil War-era law called the Feed and Forage Act. Burials and tours at Arlington National Cemetery would continue.Spy agencies give scant details on how they would be impacted, but the Director of National Intelligence has provided guidance to employees that they’re not automatically exempt from the shutdown.Among the Department of Labor agencies that would completely shutter is the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the shutdown continues through Inauguration Day, it could delay monthly reports like the employment and job openings surveys, inflation indexes and import reports. Data-dependent policymakers and investors would have to look to third parties to fill in the blanks on the health of the economy.Health and safety-related functions, like workplace inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, would continue. Many benefits programs would also be uninterrupted because they have permanent appropriations, including black lung benefits and coronavirus relief.The US Treasury building in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, March 13, 2023. US authorities took extraordinary measures to shore up confidence in the financial system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, introducing a new backstop for banks that Federal Reserve officials said was big enough to protect the entire nation's deposits. Photographer: Al Drago/BloombergThe Treasury Department broadly outlined that work would continue for those supporting the White House on market and economic updates, policy work and other items required to fulfill the president’s constitutional authorities.Many research and regulatory agencies are funded through user fees and would continue. Those include the Office of Financial Research, the Office of Recovery Programs and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Processing of cases in front of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States would cease. That could leave the fate of US Steel in limbo, if the recommendation on whether to block its sale to Nippon Steel isn’t on President Joe Biden’s desk by then.The IRS would stop picking up the phone and answering the 46,000 calls it receives on average daily, while most tax administration functions stop.The Treasury would keep working to implement tax credits created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act. A shutdown doesn’t postpone tax withholding or deadlines for any estimated tax payments due.The Federal Trade Commission would stop “the vast bulk of its competition and consumer protection investigations.”The Securities and Exchange Commission wouldn’t review or approve registrations from investment advisers, broker-dealers, transfer agents, rating organizations, investment companies and municipal advisers.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission relies on a 1995 legal opinion that its market-supervision functions are essential to prevent “massive dislocations of and losses to the private economy, as well as disruptions of many aspects of society and of private activity generally, producing incalculable amounts of suffering and loss.”The Consumer Product Safety Commission could still issue recalls where there is “an imminent threat to the safety of human life,” but more routine monitoring would cease.Most emergency relief workers would stay on the job. But disaster relief checks are already imperiled and could be delayed even further. The agency projects a $39 billion hole for the Disaster Relief Fund in 2025 without more funding.The Department of the Interior may issue some permits for offshore oil and gas drilling, but they could depend on factors like safety and the government’s property interest in the well.The Environmental Protection Agency can continue some Inflation Reduction Act-funded programs and activities with other funding sources, like cleanup at Superfund sites.The Energy Information Administration, which publishes snapshots of US oil inventories and fuel demand, would continue to collect and publish data on schedule, at least initially.The National Nuclear Security Administration would focus on maintaining and safeguarding nuclear weapon and deployed naval reactors.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission would stop licensing, certification and permitting and inspection activities, along with emergency preparedness exercises.Mortgage programs administered by the Federal Housing Administration and Ginnie Mae will continue. Many Housing and Urban Development block grants have already been obligated to states and won’t be disrupted.Subsidized housing including public housing and Section 8 housing choice vouchers don’t rely on annual spending bills but are at risk of running out of funds.“Nearly all” fair housing work would stop, according to the contingency plan.The availability of loans would depend on how they’re funded. Many disaster and Covid-19 relief programs would continue, while more traditional loan applications would be delayed. Programs supporting veteran-owned businesses, exports and mentorship would also cease.Most judicial functions can continue during a brief shutdown, using money from filing fees and other sources.Federal Reserve activity would be unaffected, meaning the central bank could still lower interest rates, regulate banks and conduct economic research.While Congress’s authority to fund itself would also run out, it also has to function to be able to end the shutdown. The 27th Amendment to the Constitution says members of Congress can’t change their rate of pay during during their terms, so they’ll still get paid.

Elon Musk flexes his political strength as US government shutdown looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-flexes-his-political-strength-as-us-government-shutdown-looms/articleshow/116486387.cms,"Elon Musk

WASHINGTON: When President-elect Donald Trump picked ""the Great Elon Musk ,"" the world's richest man, to slash government spending and waste, he mused that the effort might be ""the Manhattan Project of our time.""By Thursday, that prediction looked spot on. Wielding the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022, Musk detonated a rhetorical nuclear bomb in the middle of government shutdown negotiations on Capitol Hill.In more than 150 separate posts on X, starting before dawn on Wednesday, Musk demanded that Republicans back away from a bipartisan spending deal that was meant to avoid a government shutdown over Christmas. He vowed political retribution against anyone voting for the sprawling bill backed by House Speaker Mike Johnson , who called Musk on Wednesday to ask that he stop posting about the bill.Musk also shared misinformation about the bill, including false claims that it contained new aid for Ukraine or $3 billion in funds for a new stadium in Washington. By the end of Wednesday, Trump issued a statement of his own, calling the bill ""a betrayal of our country.""It was a remarkable moment for Musk, who has never been elected to public office but now appears to be the largest megaphone for the man about to retake the Oval Office. Larger, in fact, than Trump himself, whose own vaunted social media presence is dwarfed by that of Musk.The president-elect has 96.2 million followers on X, while Musk has 207.9 million. (Musk is also far richer than Trump. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he is worth $458 billion, while the president-elect is worth a mere $6.61 billion.)This week also marked the first time Musk has been able to use his website as a digital whip, driving lawmakers to support his desired outcome. His actions had prompted a backlash from some lawmakers who recoiled at his interference in the legislative process. Some even accused him of acting more like the president or vice president than a billionaire executive.""Democrats and Republicans spent months negotiating a bipartisan agreement to fund our government,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has long criticized the power of wealthy business executives, wrote on X. ""The richest man on Earth, President Elon Musk, doesn't like it. Will Republicans kiss the ring? Billionaires must not be allowed to run our government.""Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., the chair of the Agriculture Committee, told reporters that he ""didn't see where Musk has a voting card.""Trump sought to reclaim control of the political debate for himself on Thursday morning, issuing a threat of sorts to Johnson that he must not give in to Democrats as he tries to find a way to keep the government operating without incurring the wrath of Musk.""If the speaker acts decisively, and tough, and gets rid of all of the traps being set by the Democrats, which will economically and, in other ways, destroy our country, he will easily remain speaker,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital.On Thursday evening, Trump endorsed a new effort by Johnson to avoid a government shutdown with a spending plan that suspends the nation's debt limit for two years. In a social media post, the president-elect wrote that ""all Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote 'YES' for this Bill, TONIGHT!""Hours later, that spending deal failed to pass in the House, with 38 Republicans voting against the measure.Trump tasked Musk to rein in an out-of-control bureaucracy when he named him to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with Vivek Ramaswamy , another billionaire. Both men are among a string of tech billionaires who have flocked to Trump's Florida estate in recent weeks to cultivate their relationships with the president-elect.Trump dined with Musk and Jeff Bezos , the world's two richest men, at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night, as Musk's posts were roiling Washington. Bezos, the Amazon and Blue Origin founder who also owns The Washington Post, recently gave $1 million to the committee planning Trump's inauguration. Musk was not initially expected to be part of the dinner but joined as it was underway, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private dinner.Many House Republicans have been left deeply frustrated by Musk's involvement in spending negotiations and legitimately concerned about his threat to find primary challengers to take on any lawmakers who vote for a spending bill he doesn't like. Lawmakers said they were alarmed and that they have never seen a donor outwardly exact so much influence on policy after his preferred candidate won an election.They are also stuck taking their cues from Musk's social media feeds, where he is promoting members who are in agreement with him. Despite his occasional presence on the Hill and in his role leading DOGE, Musk does not interact directly with many members of Congress. Ramaswamy has been the one talking directly with them.On the House floor Thursday, lawmakers were fuming that Musk is not a member of Congress and is exerting too much influence on their proceedings. Thompson, who was deeply involved in negotiating direct payments for farmers that are now effectively dead because of Musk, added, ""I'm not sure he understands the plight of the normal working people right now.""As their offices were flooded with calls, appropriators and lawmakers from rural areas were livid that Musk had spent the day posting on social media to effectively kill the bill. Members were glued to his nonstop feed as they walked to and from votes, and some privately expressed concerns about their own political futures if he went through with his threats.Conservative Republicans, however, rallied behind Musk's barrage of posts. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., told Fox News, ""this is exactly what the American people voted for when they voted for Donald Trump.""After Musk threatened on X to ""vote out"" any member who voted for the spending bill, Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., cheered. ""In five years in Congress, I've been awaiting a fundamental change in the dynamic,"" he wrote online. ""It has arrived.""Some Republicans even went so far as to suggest that the party should replace Johnson with Musk as speaker, noting that speaker candidates don't have to be a sitting member of Congress to win the gavel.""I'd be open to supporting @elonmusk for Speaker of the House,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga., wrote on social media. She added: ""The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday. This could be the way.""That kind of lavish praise could come back to haunt Musk, though people close to Trump say there is no evidence of any kind of a rift between the president-elect and his richest supporter.Still, the president-elect gets famously irritable when the people in his orbit outshine him. Steve Bannon , once the chief strategist in the White House during his first term, abruptly departed after journalists focused attention on the power and influence he wielded. (One ""Saturday Night Live"" skit weeks into his presidency featured Bannon as the Grim Reaper standing behind the president and calling the shots in the Oval Office.)One of Musk's first posts about the spending bill came at 4:15 a.m. Wednesday in Washington.""This bill should not pass,"" the billionaire wrote.Between posts about his own video game antics and SpaceX's satellite internet service, he used his X account to call the bill ""criminal,"" spread misinformation about its contents and issue a rallying cry to ""stop the steal of your tax dollars!""His posts followed a similar pattern of past activity on X, where he can become hyper-fixated on a single issue that bothers him. As the most popular user on X, Musk has used his feed as a bullhorn to drive conversation on the platform and beyond.By Wednesday afternoon, House representatives and senators -- some of whom had already voiced their disapproval of the bill before Musk's outbursts -- were falling in line.""Any Member who claims to support the @DOGE should not support this 'CR of Inefficiency' that does not have offsets!!,"" Rep. Ralph Norman , R-S.C., wrote on X, using shorthand for a continuing resolution to keep federal funding flowing. ""Don't get weak in the knees before we even get started!""On Wednesday, narrative eclipsed truth. ""The terrible bill is dead,"" Musk posted just before 4 p.m. in Washington, closing his post with the Latin phrase ""Vox Populi, Vox Dei,"" which translates to ""the voice of the people is the voice of God.""He has used the refrain before, most notably when restoring Trump's Twitter account in November 2022, shortly after buying the company. This time, the man who spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars this election cycle to support Trump's campaign used it to frame his own actions as the will of American citizens.""No bills should be passed Congress until Jan. 20, when @realDonaldTrump takes office,"" Musk wrote on X. ""None. Zero.""","Elon Musk, the world's richest man, is using his social media platform to influence Congress. He is demanding that Republicans back away from a bipartisan spending deal. Musk has 207.9 million followers on X, while Trump has 96.2 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116486407,imgsize-1764227,width-400,resizemode-4/116486407.jpg"
"US House rejects Trump-backed Republican Spending Bill, government shutdown looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-rejects-trump-backed-republican-spending-bill-government-shutdown-looms/articleshow/116485932.cms,"Despite strong backing from President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, the bill faltered due to significant opposition within the Republican ranks.

Republicans divided, Democrats oppose

A shifting political landscape

The US House of Representatives on Thursday rejected a Republican-led spending bill that would have provided a temporary solution to avert a looming government shutdown , leaving lawmakers scrambling as a Friday midnight deadline nears.The bill, which aimed to extend government funding and suspend the national debt ceiling, failed by a vote of 174-235. The rejection comes just one day before the federal government is set to run out of cash, threatening widespread disruptions, including potential delays in holiday travel.Despite strong backing from President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, the bill faltered due to significant opposition within the Republican ranks. A total of 38 Republicans voted against the measure, aligning with almost all Democrats, who rejected the proposal in protest.With the government facing shutdown, federal operations could grind to a halt, affecting everything from national parks to border enforcement, and leading to pay freezes for over 2 million federal workers. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) also warned that air travel during the holiday season could be impacted by longer-than-usual wait times at airports.The bill, which resembled a previous version that Trump and Musk had criticized, included provisions to fund the government until March, when Trump will officially take office, and Republicans will control both chambers of Congress. It also proposed $100 billion in disaster relief and aimed to lift the debt ceiling for two years.However, the bill's supporters, including Trump, viewed it as a necessary step to ease the path forfuture tax cuts and spending decisions. Trump had pushed for the suspension of the debt ceiling, arguing that it would help lay the groundwork for significant tax reductions, including a promised $8 trillion tax cut. Critics, however, argued that this would further exacerbate the national debt, currently at $36 trillion.Ahead of the vote, both Republican and Democratic leaders warned that the other party would bear responsibility for a potential shutdown. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking before the vote, claimed the bill was vital for preventing a shutdown and for future spending cuts. ""Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well,"" Johnson remarked.However, the bill faced fierce opposition from Democrats, who criticized it as a giveaway to wealthy individuals like Musk, without addressing critical spending issues. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it ""a cover for a budget-busting tax cut"" that would largely benefit the rich, adding to the nation’s growing debt. “How dare you lecture America about fiscal responsibility?” he said during the floor debate.Many Republicans also voiced concerns over the bill's implications for the national debt, with Representative Chip Roy expressing his frustration: ""I am absolutely sickened by the party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility,"" he said.Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced significant challenges in the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority. The White House reiterated that President Joe Biden did not support the measure, further complicating any potential resolution.The failure of the spending bill also places a spotlight on the ongoing political instability within the Republican Party. Speaker Mike Johnson, who ascended to the role last year after a leadership shake-up that ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has struggled to unite his party around key issues. In the face of such divisions, Johnson had turned to Democrats for support on previous votes, but his efforts fell short this time.With the new year approaching and Trump’s inauguration set for January 20, Republicans face mounting pressure to come to a resolution. The government shutdown, if it proceeds, could have serious political and economic consequences, particularly as the country enters the holiday season. Meanwhile, Trump’s promise of sweeping tax cuts, without significant cuts to entitlement programs, poses a long-term challenge for fiscal responsibility.The political turmoil surrounding the government funding crisis could also undermine Johnson’s leadership, with some Republicans suggesting they may not support him as speaker when Congress reconvenes in January. This threat could set the stage for another leadership battle in the weeks leading up to Trump’s return to office.","The bill, which aimed to extend government funding and suspend the national debt ceiling, failed by a vote of 174-235.

Pakistan slams US missile sanctions as ‘biased’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-us-missile-sanctions-as-biased/articleshow/116480917.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme. Additional sanctions were imposed in Oct on China-based firms for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.",The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi.

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

Sri Lanka wins agreement with IMF for tax relief: President Dissanayake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-wins-agreement-with-imf-for-tax-relief-president-dissanayake/articleshow/116436701.cms,"COLOMBO: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday announced that Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime, something that was part of his election promise. Also, import of private cars -- banned from 2020 -- would be allowed from February 2025, Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Finance, told the parliament.Speaking about the agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during its third review of the USD 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the president said his government has been able to raise the tax threshold.""We have been able to raise the tax threshold of pay as you earn (PAYE tax) so that those who have bigger incomes pay more while those who earn pay less,"" Dissanayake said, adding there would be other VAT exemptions and withholding tax on interest incomes for the retired.""An income of Rs 1,50,000 per month will be tax free,"" Dissanayake said referring to the current free amount upto only Rs 1,00,000.Fresh from his return from an official visit to India, Dissanayake said the ban on vehicle imports would be gradually lifted.""From December 14, we have allowed the importation of the first category - vehicles for passenger transport and cars for special purposes.""From February 2025 all imports of private cars would be allowed.Sri Lanka had stopped vehicle imports from 2020 during the Covid19 outbreak due to the dwindling foreign reserves.With the economic recovery through the IMF bail out since 2023, the IMF had allowed vehicle imports by preventing any adverse impact on the need to build forex reserves.He said all such proposals would be incorporated in the 2025 budget to be presented in mid-February.There will be concessions to improve the small and medium scale industries for whom there will be debt restructuring relief based on a cap of the loan amounts.Dissanayake's government has just concluded its third review of the IMF bail out and is awaiting the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion facility.Sri Lanka had on November 26 announced that it has ratified the agreement for debt restructuring for USD 14.2 billion, compulsory to maintain debt sustainability by the IMF through an exchange of new bonds for the existing bonds.A week prior to it, the National People's Power (NPP) government got the IMF approval for a staff-level agreement to secure the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout package, something that President Dissanayake backed despite his pre-presidential election rhetoric to renegotiate with the global lender to water down tough conditions.The NPP was highly critical of the cost recovery based utility tariffs and high taxes, which came conditional to the bail out.The debt restructuring agreement was reached in the last week of the then President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime in September, days before the presidential polls.He highlighted that the exchange would provide substantial debt relief, free resources for development and ensure long-term fiscal stability.Sri Lanka had plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Wickremesinghe took over and the negotiations with the IMF began soon after. His government then clinched the bailout a year later in March 2023.As of July 2024, Sri Lanka's external debt stood at a total of USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt was USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds.","Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime.

A total of 10 truckloads of weapons were seized in April 2004 despite alleged efforts of certain ""influential quarters"" for its safe passage to United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) hideouts in northeastern India through Chattogram, which was then spelled as 'Chittagong'.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition, 1,100 sub machine guns and 11.41 million bullets.The two-member High Court bench commuted the punishment of ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who was sentenced to death after a trial in absentia --- now assumed to be living in China --- and sentenced him to life imprisonment, said a government attorney at the bench.The High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar acquitted former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who were handed down capital punishment following the death reference hearing, he added.The five others to escape the gallows are former director general of forces Intelligence (DGFI) retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of a state-run fertilizer plant (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former additional secretary of industries ministry Nurul Amin and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The plant site was said to have been used for trans-shipment of weapons for ULFA.Former chief of Bangladesh 's National Security Intelligence ex-brigadier general Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director as well, was also sentenced to death but he died a normal death in prison as the appeal and death hearing process was underway.Nizami, a former minister in the past Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat alliance government, however, was hanged several years ago on charges of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War siding with the Pakistani troops while his party was opposed to the country's independence.Babar's lawyer Shishir Manir earlier told the bench that his client had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons and the prosecution could not produce any credible evidence or trustworthy witness in support of the charges brought against him.The former junior minister was also sentenced over a 2004 grenade attack on the now deposed prime minister and the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and her top party leaders when 24 people were killed and hundreds wounded but another High Court bench acquitted him after death reference hearing on December 1.Earlier on January 30, 2014, a special tribunal in the northeastern port city of Chattogram handed down the death penalty to 14 people, including two former ministers of the past BNP government, two ex-army generals and a top ULFA leader in the arms haul case.The trial or lower court verdict had come nearly a decade after the accidental seizure of 10 truck loads of smuggled-in weapons destined to the ULFA hideouts in northeastern India through Bangladesh territory.The two politicians to get the capital punishment were Babar and Nizami, the former Jamaat ameer and then industries minister in the same cabinet, while ULFA's fugitive military wing chief Barua was one of the convicts to be awarded the death penalty.But the case was shelved for years during the past BNP-led four-party government with Jamaat being the key-ally while police officers who seized the weapons were allegedly exposed to professional harassment.The subsequent military-backed interim regime in 2008 ordered the re-investigation amid allegations that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the then administration to suppress facts to weaken the case.The supplementary chargesheet said the weapons were brought for ULFA under the supervision of some DGFI and NSI officials while the consignment was unloaded at a government jetty in Chittagong to be reloaded in trucks destined for northeastern frontiers.Officials familiar with the investigation said their extended probe found Chinese firm NORINCO to have produced the weapons but they could not identify the ship that carried the illegal consignment to Bangladesh territory.","A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment.

Bangladesh HC gives legal validity to Yunus govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-hc-gives-legal-validity-to-yunus-govt/articleshow/116414228.cms,"Bangladesh HC restores caretaker govt system & referendum provision

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim. The HC also reinstated the provision for holding referendums on constitutional amendments.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court.The Bangladesh high court scrapped on Tuesday a section of the 15th Amendment Act of the constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that the current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category.Also, in a significant step, the court revived the provision of holding referendums in case of bringing any amendment to the constitution.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court under Article 106 of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter. The court, however, did not interfere with the provisions of the 15th Amendment Act that deal with state principles, including secularism, socialism, state region, nationalism, Father of the Nation, and number of reserved seats for women in parliament, saying that future govts will take decisions on these issues.BNP said the restoration of the caretaker govt system fulfilled people's expectations. The party alleged Hasina had scrapped the system to serve her party's interests, paving the way for ""one-party rule"".","Bangladesh HC scrapped section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution.

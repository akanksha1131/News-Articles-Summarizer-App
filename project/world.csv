‘Significant positive impact’: Australia to ban children from YouTube; how will the govt restrict underage accounts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/significant-positive-impact-australia-to-ban-children-from-youtube-how-will-the-govt-restrict-underage-accounts/articleshow/122987348.cms,"Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese (AP)





Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December. This comes after the federal government reverses its earlier stance to exempt the platform from national social media restrictions for under-16s, reports the Guardian.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and communications minister Anika Wells are expected to formally announce the decision on Wednesday, the same day YouTube is set to host a major event for MPs at Parliament House, a move likely to spark tension with the Google-owned giant.“Social media has a social responsibility and there is no doubt that Australian kids are being negatively impacted by online platforms so I’m calling time on it,” Albanese stated. “Social media is doing social harm to our children, and I want Australian parents to know that we have their backs.”This decision follows a recommendation from the internet regulator last week, urging the government to reverse YouTube’s exemption. A survey earlier revealed that around 37 percent of minors encountered harmful content on the platform, reports Reuters.Apart from YouTube, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others are on the list of age-restricted social media sites.The move comes after eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant highlighted findings from a recent survey of 2,600 children, revealing that nearly 40% had encountered harmful content on YouTube making it “the most frequently cited platform in our research”.The under-16 bans are set to take place in December, with platforms facing penalties of up to $49.5m if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to prevent children from creating accounts. Some major tech companies have expressed concerns over what constitutes “reasonable steps"" to comply with the new rules.The legislation only limits children from holding accounts, they will still be able to watch YouTube, notes Inman Grant.“The Albanese government is giving kids a reprieve from the persuasive and pervasive pull of social media while giving parents peace of mind,” said Anika Wells. “There’s a place for social media, but there’s not a place for predatory algorithms targeting children.”“There is no one perfect solution when it comes to keeping young Australians safer online – but the social media minimum age will make a significantly positive difference to their wellbeing,” she added.“YouTube is a video sharing platform, not a social media service, that offers benefit and value to younger Australians,” a YouTube spokesperson said on Sunday, reports the Guardian.",Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December.

A convicted felon out on parole has been charged with capital murder in the fatal shooting of a sheriff’s deputy in Kansas City, Kansas. Shawn M Harris, 38, who had previously served time for aggravated robbery and other crimes, allegedly opened fire on officers responding to a routine call, killing Wyandotte county deputy Elijah Ming.Authorities say the shooting occurred Saturday when officers responded to a “standby” call, a routine police presence to keep the peace, after a woman reported that Harris had threatened friends who were helping her move out of his home.As deputy Ming and a Kansas City police officer approached the residence, Harris allegedly opened fire, striking Ming multiple times. The deputy died later at a hospital.“We do thousands of these types of calls a year,” Kansas City Police chief Karl Oakman said during a news conference on Tuesday as quoted by AP.In addition to the capital murder charge, Harris is also charged with violating a Kansas law that prohibits people with felony records from possessing firearms. The charges were filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by district attorney Mark Dupree Sr.Harris made his first court appearance Tuesday. District Judge Daniel Cahill set his bond at $2 million. He is currently being held in neighboring Johnson County.Dupree said he will consult with Ming’s family before deciding within the next 10 days whether to pursue the death penalty. The only alternative sentence would be life in prison without the possibility of parole. Kansas currently has nine men on death row, but the state has not carried out an execution since 1965, according to AP.The state’s death penalty defense unit has been appointed to represent Harris, as he could not afford an attorney.Harris was paroled in Kansas in October 2023 after pleading guilty to seven felony charges between 2012 and 2013 in both Kansas and Missouri. His convictions include aggravated robbery, attempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and felony theft in Wyandotte County, as well as felony tampering with a motor vehicle in Lafayette County, Missouri.He was transferred from Kansas to Missouri in 2013 to face additional charges and pled guilty to assault while serving time there. Harris returned to Kansas in 2021 and was released on parole two years later.","Shawn M Harris, 38, allegedly opened fire on officers responding to a routine call, killing Wyandotte county deputy Elijah Ming.

Julia Hyman, Aland Etienne, Wesley LePatner and Didarul Islam were identified as the four victims of the ghastly NYC shooting at 345 Park Avenue. They all worked separately but Monday evening, all four of them were in front of the crazed gunman Shane Tamura at some point. While Didarul Islam was a Bangadeshi-origin police officer, Aland Etienne was a security guard, Julia Hyman worked for Rudin Management, the company that owns the Midtown skyscraper, and Wesley LePatner was a senior executive of Blackstone which has its office in the same building.Julia Hyman was a 27-year-old Cornell grad who had been working as a Rudin associate for less than a year. The killer reportedly took a wrong elevator and reached the floor of Rudin Management, where he encountered Julia Hyman and shot her dead. Investigators believe Shane Tamura, the shooter, wanted to attack the NFL's office but accidentally ended up on a different floor.Hyman was the last person to be killed before the killer shot himself.“The Rudin family and everyone at our company are devastated by yesterday’s senseless tragedy,” a Rudin rep said in a statement.“Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured and lost last night, including our cherished Rudin colleague, a brave New York City police officer, a beloved lobby security guard and an employee at a tenant firm.Aland Etienne, 46, was identified as of four innocent victims killed by Tamura as he entered 345 Park Avenue.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out attending the G20 summit in South Africa this November, citing what he described as “very bad policies” and repeating widely discredited claims that white citizens in the country are being systematically targeted and killed.Asked aboard Air Force One whether he would travel to the leaders’ summit in November, Trump said, “No, I think maybe I'll send somebody else, because I've had a lot of problems with South Africa. They have some very bad policies... A lot of people are being killed. So I think I probably won't. I'd like to, but I don't think I will,” as quoted by AFP.Trump has repeatedly criticised South Africa during his second term, promoting claims that white citizens, particularly farmers, are being targeted. The claims were amplified by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa.The Trump administration has also taken issue with South Africa’s land expropriation law, signed in January, which aims to address land ownership inequalities rooted in the apartheid era.Washington has opposed the law, arguing it could lead to arbitrary confiscations of white-owned land. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has rejected that interpretation, defending the policy as part of broader efforts at economic justice.In May, Trump stunned South African officials during a White House meeting with Ramaphosa by playing a video he claimed showed a ""genocide"" of the white minority, with reporters present.The Trump administration has cited the persecution claims in granting asylum to South Africa’s Afrikaner minority. The US also imposed 30 per cent tariffs on South African goods starting August 1.Earlier this year, US secretary of state Marco Rubio also boycotted a G20 foreign ministers’ meeting held in Johannesburg.","US President Donald Trump ruled out attending the G20 summit in South Africa this November.

"Republican Guv Ron DeSantis calls H-1B visa a scam, says it's not illegal but...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republican-guv-ron-desantis-calls-h-1b-visa-a-scam-says-its-not-illegal-but-/articleshow/122981835.cms,"Florida Guv Ron DeSantis called H-1B visa program a scam.





Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the H-1B visa program a total scam as Americans are getting laid off, making way for foreign workers. H-1B is the visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign workers. It has become a contentious issue as US big techs including Microsoft, Intel announced major layoffs. Republicans want H-1B to end while the Donald Trump administration is planning major changes in the program.“They’re laying off all these American workers and then they’re importing H1B visa people to work for cheaper. I think that’s a total scam. I don’t think that’s good. Yes, it is legal the way they’re doing it. I acknowledge that. They’re using something that’s on the books. But is that good policy for us as a country to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H1B (visas)? And then they do chain migration from the H1B. So the H1B is bringing in other folks,” DeSantis said.DeSantis compared the dynamic to indentured servitude, citing how H‑1B workers are tied to a single employer, which companies exploit to cut costs. Earlier in January 2025, he called out broad issues with the H‑1B system, sharply criticizing practices where Americans train H‑1B workers who then replace them, asking how such a system could even be acceptable.The comment came as recently vice president JD Vance spoke about the H-1B issue and said the displacement of American workers makes him worried. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me.""""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bullshit story,"" he said.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the H-1B visa program a total scam.

The father of NYPD officer Didarul Islam, who lost his life in the deadly Manhattan shooting that claimed the lives of five people Monday evening, grew so distraught when he learned of his son’s death at the hands of a gunman that he suffered a stroke.Islam’s cousin, Muhammad Mainul Islam, told the New York Post that the news also deeply affected the officer’s pregnant wife, who was rushed to the hospital by police on Tuesday morning.“They are all crying,” the cousin said. “There is no brother- only him. The family is really feeling a big problem. His wife had the doctor’s appointment. I heard one police officer from the precinct, she took [her] to the hospital.”“His father went last night to see him. When he heard the message, he had a stroke, feeling bad. So he had a stroke so the hospital did not release him,” he added as quoted by The New York Post.Didarul Islam, a married father of two, was shot and killed Monday evening by 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura of Las Vegas. The shooting occurred around 6.30 pm inside a 44-story building on Park Avenue.According to police, Tamura exited a double-parked car with an M4 rifle and immediately opened fire.He killed four people, and injured one other before taking his own life on the 33rd floor.The shooting took place during the evening rush hour, prompting a large emergency response. The NYPD’s bomb squad, drone units, and heavily armed officers were deployed. Multiple ambulances and helicopters were also present.Officer Islam was fatally shot in the building’s lobby. He had served for over three years with the NYPD’s 47th Precinct in the Bronx. Originally from Bangladesh, he had moved to the US seeking a better life.US President Donald Trump condoled the incident in a post on Truth Social, saying, “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love. I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence. My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice.

A US federal court on Monday blocked the Donald Trump administration from enforcing a provision in a recently enacted tax and spending bill that would strip Planned Parenthood and its affiliates of Medicaid funding, ruling the measure is likely unconstitutional.District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued the decision, expanding on an earlier order that had only protected certain affiliates. The new ruling ensures Medicaid payments continue for all Planned Parenthood clinics.“Patients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable,” Talwani wrote in her order, as reported by news agency AP. “In particular, restricting Members’ ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs. ”She added that the court was “not enjoining the federal government from regulating abortion and is not directing the federal government to fund elective abortions or any healthcare service not otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage.”Planned Parenthood federation of America, along with member organisations in Massachusetts and Utah, filed the lawsuit earlier this month against health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, warning that nearly 200 clinics in 24 states could close if Medicaid funding were withdrawn, potentially leaving over 1 million patients without care.“We’re suing the Trump administration over this targeted attack on Planned Parenthood health centers and the patients who rely on them for care,” said Planned Parenthood’s president and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement Monday. “This case is about making sure that patients who use Medicaid as their insurance to get birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment can continue to do so at their local Planned Parenthood health center, and we will make that clear in court. ”The provision in question, part of a tax bill that took effect on July 4, directed the federal government to withhold Medicaid payments for one year from abortion providers receiving more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in 2023. Though Planned Parenthood was not named directly, the organization said it was the clear target, with nearly 600 clinics in 48 states affected.Talwani emphasized that the court is not requiring the government to fund abortions or services not normally covered by Medicaid. Her ruling blocks the government from excluding organizations like Planned Parenthood that have shown a strong case in court.A spokesperson for the department of health and human services criticised the ruling, saying it “undermines state flexibility and disregards longstanding concerns about accountability.”Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides healthcare coverage to millions of low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly half of Planned Parenthood’s patients rely on Medicaid for their healthcare.","A US federal court on Monday blocked the Donald Trump administration from enforcing a provision in a recently enacted tax and spending bill that would strip Planned Parenthood and its affiliates of Medicaid funding.

Trump Vs Netanyahu Fight; U.S. President Shames Israel On Gaza Starvation, Busts Bibi's Lie





Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a prominent supporter of US President Donald Trump and a vocal figure in the MAGA movement, has become the first member of her party in Congress to describe the situation in the Gaza Strip as a ""genocide. ""Her comments mark a significant departure from the stance held by the vast majority of Republicans, who have consistently voiced unconditional support for Israel.In a post on X Monday evening, Greene said, ""It's the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7 in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza.""Her statement was the strongest in a recent string of increasingly critical remarks about Israel’s conduct in the ongoing war, reflecting a growing concern among some on the right over the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza, reported The New York Times.On Sunday, Greene said, ""I can unequivocally say that what happened to innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th was horrific. Just as I can unequivocally say that what has been happening to innocent people and children in Gaza is horrific.""Greene’s remarks were seen as a direct rebuke of fellow Republican Rep Randy Fine of Florida, who has come under fire for his comments regarding the suffering of Palestinians.Fine had referred to images of starving children in Gaza as part of a campaign of ""Muslim terror propaganda"" and wrote, ""Release the hostages… until then, starve away.""Responding to this, Greene in her recent post added, ""A Jewish US Representative calling for the continued starvation of innocent people and children is disgraceful.

‘Hamas Is Capable’: Iran RAGES After Trump Accuses Tehran Of Stonewalling Gaza Ceasefire Talks

.





Following the tragic shooting in Manhattan that resulted in the deaths of five individuals, including a New York police department officer, US President Donald Trump expressed his deep condolences on Monday evening. He urged law enforcement agencies to to carry out a thorough investigation into the incident.Taking to his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love. I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence.”“My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice. God Bless the New York Police Department, and God Bless New York!” he added.The shooting took place at 345 Park Avenue, a high-rise corporate building that houses major firms including the NFL and Blackstone.According to police, the gunman, identified as 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura of Las Vegas, exited a double-parked car outside the building armed with an M4 rifle and immediately opened fire.Tamura continued through the building, killing three civilians and injuring one more, before taking his own life on the 33rd floor.NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed the shooter was “neutralised” and that “the scene has been contained.” Authorities also revealed that Tamura had a documented history of mental illness.Surveillance footage showed that he allowed one woman to leave unharmed while indiscriminately firing at others, including a security guard and a person on the upper floors.The incident occurred during the height of the evening rush hour, prompting a swift and large-scale emergency response. NYPD’s bomb squad and drone units were deployed, while heavily armed officers secured the building. Multiple ambulances and helicopters were also present at the scene.The NYPD officer, Islam, mentioned by Trump in his post was fatally shot by Tamura in the lobby before continuing through the building,Officer Islam, the fallen officer mentioned in Trump’s post, was fatally shot by Tamura in the lobby before continuing through the building.

He is survived by his wife, who is eight months pregnant, and their two young sons.Mayor Eric Adams paid tribute to the slain officer, describing him as, “a true-blue New Yorker, not only in the uniform he wore but in his spirit and energy of loving this city,” in his post on X.","Shooting took place at 345 Park Avenue, a high-rise corporate building that houses major firms including the NFL and Blackstone.

Who are the victims of the Manhattan shooting?



Wesley LePatner

Didarul Islam

The killing of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner in a crazed shooting by Shane Tamura at Park Avenue office in Manhattan Monday evening leaves many questions about the shooting unanswered. LePatner was one of the five people killed in the shooting that included an NYPD officer. Tamura was also found dead at the site.The office building where Shane Tamura opened fire randomly houses many offices making it initially unclear whether it was a targeted killing or a random one. The shooter had a mental condition as well and a there was note found on him in which NFL was blamed for his brain condition.Tamura was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy which often times is often caused by head trauma, possible in sports like football. But Tamura did not play football professionally.Evidence pointed to the NFL office as the possible target but after Jewish Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner was identified as a victim, the case took a different turn as many social media theorists claimed that it was an anti semitic attack, made to look like a random attack with NFL appearing like a missed target.NYC mayor Eric Adams said Tamura intended to target the NFL headquarters but took the wrong elevator and went to the 33rd floor to Rudin Management, which owns the building.He shot and killed one person there. Wesley Patner was said to be caught in the crossfire but for many commentators, this is not a convincing explanation as to why a senior Blackstone executive was killed.""Wesley LePatner wasn’t just another real estate executive. She controlled billions in capital flows, strategic asset classes, and sensitive data involving real estate-backed securities, which are known laundering channels for sovereign wealth, off-ledger assets, and covert financial networks,"" one wrote on X, claiming that probably she was the target.The NFL offices are on floors 5 through 8 of the 44-story building.Wesley LePatner, Blackstone executive, was killed in crossfire. LePatner joined Blackstone in 2014 after more than a decade at Goldman Sachs, according to Blackstone. While overseeing BREIT, a trust with a real estate portfolio totaling more than $53 billion in property, LePatner was also a member of Blackstone’s real estate investment committee. She served on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Abraham Joshua Heschel School, the UJA-Federation of New York and the Yale University Library Council.New York Police Department officer Didarul Islam, 36, was killed in the shooting. Islam had worked as a police officer in the city for three and a half years and was one of two New York police officers working as paid security detail in the building.The third victim has been identified as Julia Hyman, a Cornell University grad who worked for the management company that owned the Midtown skyscraper. Two other victims have not been identified yet.","Shane Tamura opened fire at Park Avenue office in Manhattan Monday evening.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.

They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

Pakistan Flood Fury: Watch Moment Journalist Gets Washed Away While Reporting In Rawalpindi





At least 54 people have died in the past 24 hours across Pakistan, pushing the monsoon-related death toll to around 180 since late June, the government's disaster management agency reported on Thursday.Pakistan's Punjab region has been lashed by relentless rain since Wednesday morning, triggering urban flooding and widespread disruption in several low-lying areas.Officials have ordered residents near the river flowing through Rawalpindi — next to the capital Islamabad — to evacuate following a sudden surge in water levels.Authorities have advised residents in vulnerable areas to prepare emergency kits with food, water, and essential medicines for three to five days, in case of worsening conditions.A spokesperson for the national disaster management authority (NDMA) told AFP that 54 people were killed and around 227 injured across Pakistan in the past 24 hours. The death toll was recorded as of 8:00 am (0300 GMT) on Thursday, she added.Since June 26, around 180 people — including 70 children — have died, and nearly 500 have been injured.The meteorological department has warned that heavy rainfall will continue until Friday.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Trump Praises Farage, Starmer Stares; High Drama At Bilateral Meet | Watch





In a major policy shift, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday announced that the United Kingdom will formally recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September, unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza and takes steps toward a lasting peace process.Chairing a rare summer Cabinet meeting on the crisis, Starmer told ministers that recognition would move ahead unless Israel ""takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, reaches a ceasefire, makes clear there will be no annexation in the West Bank, and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two-state solution,"" according to the news agency Associated Press.He also added that Hamas must release all hostages, agree to a ceasefire, “accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza, and commit to disarmament.” Starmer said his government would assess “how far the parties have met these steps” before making a final decision on recognition in September.The UK has long backed a two-state solution, with Palestinian and Israeli states existing side by side, but had previously maintained that formal recognition of Palestine should come only as part of a negotiated peace deal. The recent escalation in Gaza, however, appears to have shifted the government’s stance.Starmer’s declaration comes amid mounting international and domestic pressure. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would become the first G7 nation to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN in September. That decision has galvanised calls across Europe, including within Starmer’s own Labour Party, to follow suit. Recognition of Palestine had also been part of Labour’s election-winning manifesto in 2024.According to news agency AFP, Starmer presented elements of the UK’s Gaza peace plan to US President Donald Trump during their meeting in Scotland on Monday. The UK plan, unlike Macron’s move, is said to be conditional, aimed at pushing Israel to halt hostilities and commit to a peace roadmap.""The continued captivity of hostages, the starvation and denial of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, the increasing violence from extremist settler groups, and Israel's disproportionate military escalation in Gaza are all indefensible,"" Starmer said last week, adding that he is ""working on a pathway to peace"" which includes recognising a Palestinian state.""I am unequivocal about that,"" he said, as per AFP.Trump has publicly taken a softer stance on Starmer’s position than on Macron’s, telling reporters, “I don’t mind him taking a position.” Trump also signalled a shift in his own approach toward Gaza, acknowledging that “Israel has a lot of responsibility” and saying he would press Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure humanitarian aid reaches civilians: “I want him to make sure they get the food,” Trump said.The UK, France, and Germany have all criticised Israel for withholding essential humanitarian aid in Gaza. Starmer has committed to joining Jordan-led airdrop missions to deliver relief to the enclave, where over two million people are facing what UN agencies have described as ""a deadly wave of starvation and malnutrition.""According to the AP, the UK’s conditions for recognising Palestine include not just a ceasefire, but also Israel’s agreement to halt any further annexation of West Bank territory, and a commitment to negotiating a two-state solution without the involvement of Hamas.A source cited by AFP said that London remains firm on “no role for Hamas” in any future Palestinian government.Meanwhile, Macron’s announcement has drawn criticism from Netanyahu, who called the decision “a grave mistake” and accused France of ignoring the threat posed by Hamas. The Israeli PM warned that his country would not accept “moral lectures” from countries that “reject independence in their own territories”.Despite such backlash, nearly 150 nations already recognise Palestine. The latest diplomatic push from Western powers reflects growing outrage over Israel’s actions in Gaza and concern over the long-term viability of the peace process.Starmer is expected to present his plan to allies in the coming days. “Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps,” he reiterated, calling it essential to any sustainable resolution to the conflict.Starmer said that despite the set of conditions he set out, Britain believes that “statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people.”","British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the UK will recognise Palestine at the UN in September.

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors. Though there was no set agenda, both sides “had things to talk about”.","Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.

When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

Food crime: Cardiff men jailed for selling fake halal meat to restaurants; nearly 3 tonnes seized in raid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/food-crime-cardiff-men-jailed-for-selling-fake-halal-meat-to-restaurants-nearly-3-tonnes-seized-in-raid/articleshow/122899671.cms,"



Two men from Cardiff have been sentenced after running a fraudulent meat supply operation that misled restaurants and takeaways into believing they were being sold halal chicken.Hamil Miah, 46, who ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited, was jailed for four years and eight months after being found guilty of fraud and trading while bankrupt. Noaf Rahman, also 46 and from Cardiff, pleaded guilty before the trial and was given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in the offences.The fraud was uncovered after a 2019 investigation led authorities to a warehouse in Cardiff, where 2,840 kg of frozen meat was seized. Officials from Cardiff and Vale Shared Regulatory Services discovered serious breaches of food hygiene, with meat transported in filthy vans, expiry dates tampered with, and no clear traceability of products.The court heard that, over five years, the pair supplied chicken to eateries across south and west Wales under the pretence that it was halal. In reality, much of it was not, and even where halal meat was purchased, it became contaminated in the warehouse, which was also used to process non-halal meat.Prosecutor Alex Greenwood told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court that customers “were in fact consuming non-halal products as a result of the criminality of these two defendants.”The businesses buying the meat were unaware of the fraud, believing they were dealing with legitimate suppliers behind the “corporate veil,” BBC reported.Judge Vanessa Francis condemned the operation saying Miah and Rahman had a ""cavalier attitude"" and were equally responsible.She described the misconduct as a “disaster waiting to happen” and highlighted the widespread impact of their actions, noting, that the “harm in my view is extensive” and there were ""flagrant breaches over a significant period of time"".""This was a disaster waiting to happen and it is a matter of relief that it never did with the unsafe meat sent out of your premises,"" BBC cited the judge.The names of affected restaurants were not disclosed in court due to the sensitive nature of the case.","Hamil Miah, 46, and Noaf Rahman, also 46, ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited.

"Visa boost for desi professionals, chefs in trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/visa-boost-for-desi-professionals-chefs-in-trade-agreement/articleshow/122891211.cms,"NEW DELHI: Independent professionals as well as business visitors, company executives and investors can expect a more predictable visa regime to the United Kingdom once the trade deal signed Thursday is implemented.The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors attending meetings and conferences, experienced employees, graduate trainees, investors, as well as musicians, chefs and yoga teachers. The British govt will, however, closely monitor eligibility norms to avoid a large influx.For instance, senior executives of service sector companies with branches in India and UK will get visas for three years. Contractual service providers across more sectors will be eligible for business visas of up to 12 months.Govt sources said the UK has agreed not to impose numerical limits on Indian business mobility and won't require Indian companies to advertise locally before applying for these visas. Last year, the UK granted 25,117 visas under the Global Business Mobility route. The deal provides for 1,800 annual visas to Indian musicians, chefs and yoga teachers.Indian nurses, accountants and other professionals can look forward to academic qualifications being recognised in the UK, as the deal pushes for mutual recognition agreements.India has kept legal services out of bounds but agreed to let British accounting and audit firms set up shop here, provided the UK offers reciprocal access. Like in the Australian ECTA, architectural services are now open to British firms. The UK has made offers across 12 major services sectors and 137 sub-sectors. India will open 11 sectors and 108 sub-sectors.While India has locked in 100% FDI in telecom, insurance and aviation, it refused to ease cap on British banks opening more branches.The deal also facilitates Indian educational institutions & hospitals expanding into UK.","The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors.

"With zero duty access, India eyes boom in key exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/with-zero-duty-access-india-eyes-boom-in-key-exports/articleshow/122891051.cms,"Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal and his British counterpart Jonathan Reynold during the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), in the UK.





NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports.

Trump Says He Spoke To PM Modi On Diwali, Repeats Russian Oil Remark





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said India is not going to be buying “too much oil” from Moscow, suggesting that he had received assurances from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that New Delhi would be tapering Russian oil purchases without completely stopping the transactions.“I spoke to Prime Minister Modi today and we just have a very good relationship. He's not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war (between Russia and Ukraine) end as much as I do. They're not going to be buying too much oil,"" Trump said at a White House Diwali event at which he lit a diya (lamp) in the Oval Office.""So they've cut it way back, and they're continuing to cut it way back..."" he added.The US President appeared to dial down his earlier claims that India would halt buying Russian oil completely (“a big stop” he called it), with the latest comments providing some wiggle room for both sides to press ahead with direct talks on trade and tariffs. Oil trade circles are not reporting any significant tapering in Indian oil purchases from Russia, much of which is routed through private players with future contracts.“I love the people of India. We're working on some great deals between our countries,” Trump said, as he greeted the people of India on Diwali while celebrating the festival of lights in the White House with a flock of Indian-Americans in the administration and corporate world, seeming also to want to repair some of the self-inflicted damage to his ratings in a country where he had a high approval numbers before the tariff tantrums.The two leaders could meet as soon as early next week on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Malaysia where Trump is heading to over the weekend. PM Modi’s trip has not been announced and could depend on whether the two leaders have something substantive on hand beyond mere optics, handshakes, and hugs.Leaders of Russia, China, and India appear to be leery of meeting Trump because of what some diplomats say is lack of serious preparation by US interlocutors and his penchant for grandstanding before the media.Trump also dropped a clanger at the Diwali event by disclosing he and Modi talked about “let’s have no war with Pakistan.” New Delhi prefers to deal with Islamabad on a bilateral basis and has made it clear that Pakistan cannot inflict terror attacks on India under a nuclear umbrella.“He’s a great person and he’s become a great friend of mine,” Trump said of Modi, in line with his personalized approach to countries he is at odds with, including China, Russia, and Brazil.At the same event, he also reeled back a meeting he had announced with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest, saying it would be a waste of time and he did not want an unproductive meeting.Trump wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire at current battlefront, but Moscow has indicated it needs guarantees that Ukraine will remain neutral and not be drafted into NATO, conditions that are unacceptable to Kiev and its European partners who fear future Russian transgressions.",US President Donald Trump said India is not going to be buying “too much oil” from Moscow.

'Hamas Has 20K Fighters': Israel's Shock Reveal After Claiming Destruction Of Group's Military Wing





A 55-year-old Palestinian woman was hospitalised after a masked Jewish settler struck her on the head while she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank and was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Nathaniel said the settler struck the woman unconscious with a stick and hit her again as she lay on the ground. He rejected claims that Israeli soldiers intervened, saying, “no Israeli forces showed up to the attack at any point.”According to Nathaniel, soldiers had been present before the assault and had “lured” him and others into an “ambush” before driving away moments prior to the settlers’ attack.Footage shows the assailant wielding a large wooden stick with a knotted end, resembling a club, which he swings overhead before striking Abu Alia.""It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,"" Nathaniel was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.""The assault was part of a larger incident involving at least 15 masked settlers who threw stones and attacked Palestinian olive harvesters and activists, including Nathaniel. One car was set on fire, and several others had their windows smashed.The UN and rights groups have warned that Palestinian farmers face increasing risks as the olive harvest season begins.“Settler violence has skyrocketed in scale and frequency,” stated Ajith Sunghay, the head of the UN Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territory on Tuesday.Turmus Ayya, a predominantly Palestinian-American village situated in a valley surrounded by Israeli settlements, has long been targeted by settler violence, which residents say has escalated amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.The United Nations reports that the first half of 2025 saw 757 settler attacks resulting in casualties or property damage, marking a 13 percent increase compared with the same period last year.During the opening week of the olive harvest, more than 150 attacks were recorded, with over 700 olive trees reportedly uprooted, damaged, or poisoned, according to Muayyad Shaaban, head of a Palestinian Authority office monitoring the violence, as cited by AP Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East War.

Psaki vs Vance clash timeline





A month after former White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Vice President JD Vance clashed over the deadly Minneapolis school shooting, the two seems to face off once more—this time on a more personal stage.MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Tuesday joked about the perceived threat posed by Vice President JD Vance during the ""I've Had It"" podcast. Psaki and the podcast hosts expressed concern over Vance's role in the Trump administration.“I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you okay? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you.”She continued, “And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him.”Psaki's comment on Vance and his wife didn't go well with a lot of netizens, one of them calling her statement ""disgusting."" Another user commented, ""What an awful thing to say.She should read the book. She's part of the reason JD is JD.""A user also said, ""Funny how “feminism” suddenly stops applying when the woman in question doesn’t vote the right way. Guess empowerment has party lines now.""Several users shared the videos on their X accounts and criticised Psaki's comments as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"" for mocking Vance's marriage and suggesting someone was worse than the ""worse than Hitler"" Trump.""Not a good person. At all,"" Fox News contributor Joe Concha remarked.The Libs of TikTok X account wrote, ""Unhinged Jen Psaki is now smearing JD Vance, suggesting that his wife, Usha, wants to leave her husband and offers to 'save' her. She also thinks JD Vance is 'scarier' than Donald Trump. @MSNBC should be ashamed to pay her salary.""On August 27-2025, following the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis, Jen Psaki and JD Vance engaged in a public exchange over the role of prayer in the aftermath of such tragedies.A prayer was held at the church-cum-school to mourn the victims, during which Psaki, in a post on X, questioned if offering a prayer after a shooting was appropriate.""Prayer is not freaking enough,"" she wrote. ""Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers.”In response, JD Vance criticised Psaki in an X post, calling her comments the ""most bizarre"" of ""all the weird left wing culture wars.""Earlier, in 2024, Psaki took aim at Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio senator JD Vance, accusing him of ""inauthenticity"" on the campaign trail.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M. Cuomo tightens considerably when Republican Curtis Sliwa is excluded from the contest, according to a new poll.A new poll from AARP and Gotham Polling indicates that Democrat Zohran Mamdani maintains a lead in the New York City mayoral race with 43.2%.Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo follows in second place at 28.9%, while Republican Curtis Sliwa holds third place with 19.4%. The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers. Andrew Cuomo is spending it speaking about the other candidates.""

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?



How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet Najah Al Masaeed reveals she lost $7 million to a financial scam.

What’s the buzz about the Orionid Meteor shower?

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

Sanae Takaichi made history on Tuesday, winning Japan’s parliamentary vote to become the nation’s first female prime minister. Her victory was met with enthusiasm in domestic stock markets.Takaichi secured 237 votes in the first round in the 465-seat Lower House, eliminating the need for a runoff, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her election follows a weekend agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party to form a coalition government.Takaichi will succeed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political deadlock following the Liberal Democratic Party's poor showing in the July elections. Ishiba, who served only one year, resigned along with his Cabinet earlier Tuesday, clearing the way for his successor.“Political stability is essential right now,” Takaichi said at Monday’s signing ceremony with JIP leader and Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura. “Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy.”A candidate who secures a simple majority in both the lower and upper houses of parliament is elected prime minister.If no candidate achieves this, a run-off is held between the two with the most votes from the first round. In the run-off, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority, as cited by Reuters.If the two chambers disagree, the lower house’s decision takes precedence.After being elected prime minister, Takaichi is expected to form a Cabinet including several allies of LDP kingmaker Taro Aso and other supporters from the party leadership vote.Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have opposed measures for women’s advancement. She supports male-only succession in the imperial family, opposes same-sex marriage, and is against allowing married couples to have separate surnames, as cited by AP.A protégé of the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to follow his policies, including strengthening the military and economy and revising Japan’s pacifist constitution.Takaichi, who admires Britain’s first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher and calls herself Japan’s ""Iron Lady,"" has drawn criticism for her hardline conservative views.Opponents, including former Premier Kishida, have labeled her ""Taliban Takaichi."" She is a wartime history revisionist, takes a hawkish stance on China, and frequently visits the Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of militarism. However, she has not confirmed if she will continue this practice as prime minister.PM Modi on Tuesday congratulated Sanae Takaichi on her election as Japan’s prime minister and said he looked forward to working together further to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries.""I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sanae Takaichi upon her appointement as Prime Minister of Japan. I look forward to working closely together to further evolve the special strategic global partnership that Japan and India have built.

Economic goals



Who will benefit/suffer



Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children. The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy. An average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124672273,imgsize-81514,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Why did the Colombian court acquit Uribe?





What was the case against Uribe?





Uribe charges deepen US-Colombia rift









A Colombian court on Tuesday overturned convictions against former President Alvaro Uribe for bribery and witness tampering.Uribe, who served as Colombia's president from 2002 to 2010, was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after being found guilty in August.Last month, Colombia's supreme court ordered Uribe's release from detention until his appeals were heard.He was the first former Colombian president to be convicted of criminal charges.The Bogota High Court said that the charges had not been demonstrated ""beyond reasonable doubt.""""It was not proven directly or indirectly that Alvaro Uribe instigated the crime of bribery in criminal proceedings ... therefore, the court will overturn the sentence imposed on Alvaro Uribe Velez,"" judge Manuel Antonio Merchan said.The court concluded that the initial sentence had ""methodological errors, fallacies of interpretation and biased evaluation of evidence,"" adding it had amounted to ""inferences"" without ""objective support.""In 2012, Uribe accused leftist senator Ivan Cepeda of bribing former paramilitary members, who have since been jailed, to tie the ex-president to the right-wing groups.But the supreme court rejected Uribe's allegation and instead accused him of having pressured witnesses.Cepeda has said he would appeal Tuesday's ruling, which will take the case to Colombia's top court.Uribe's time in office was marked by a military campaign against left-wing guerillas and drug cartels.The paramilitaries were founded by cattle ranchers, landowners and merchants to fight leftist guerilla groups such as the FARC.They have been accused of killing over 450,000 between 1985 and 2018.Uribe has alleged that the charges were born out of political persecution against him.US secretary of state Marco Rubio expressed his support for the embattled former right-wing president, saying that the case was an example of ""weaponization"" by Colombian judges.In response, left-wing President Gustavo Petro called for Washington to respect the independence of Colombia's judiciary.It comes amid a broader rift between the two countries, with US President Donald Trump threatening tariffs against Colombia over accusations of involvement of drug trafficking.","Colombian court overturns convictions against former President Alvaro Uribe.

‘I’m not a secret Nazi’: Graham Platner says he will remove tattoo resembling Nazi symbol — what is the ‘Totenkopf’?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-not-a-secret-nazi-graham-platner-says-he-will-remove-tattoo-resembling-nazi-symbol-what-is-the-totenkopf/articleshow/124731511.cms,"What is Totenkopf ?



Who is Graham Platner?







Graham Platner, the Democratic Senate hopeful from Maine, expressed regret over getting a tattoo that appears similar to a Nazi symbol nearly two decades ago and posted it on Reddit, which has resurfaced.Platner said that he planned to remove the tattoo after questions were raised, including from a former top campaign staffer, about how he could have been unaware of its connotations.Platner’s campaign sought to preempt opposition research regarding his tattoo, which resembles a Nazi skull and crossbones, during an appearance on the liberal podcast Pod Save America on Monday. His campaign shared a video of him dancing shirtless. Platner stated that he was unaware of any Nazi link when he got the tattoo.He emphasized in the interview that he was “not a secret Nazi” and pointed to his Reddit comment history as evidence of his opposition to Nazism, antisemitism and racism. “I would say a lifelong opponent,” he stated.The tattoo revelation came after Platner apologized last week for a series of offensive Reddit posts spanning 2013 to 2021. On Friday, he issued a video apology for posts like calling police officers “bastards”, questioning why Black people tip less, and appearing to agree with characterizations of rural white voters as “racist” and “stupid”.“It was not until I started hearing from reporters and DC insiders that I realized this tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol,” Platner said in a statement to POLITICO on Tuesday.“I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that — and to insinuate that I did is disgusting. I am already planning to get this removed.”Platner reiterated that he obtained the tattoo while out drinking with fellow Marines in Croatia, choosing the skull and crossbones off a wall at the tattoo parlor.He claimed the similarity to Nazi iconography never arose, including during physical examinations mandated by the US Army, which prohibits tattoos of identified hate symbols. “In the nearly 20 years since, this hasn’t come up,” Platner said.The tattoo in question resembles the Totenkopf, or “death’s head” symbol. “Totenkopf” is a German word typically referring to an image of a skull and crossbones. During the Nazi era, one form of the image was adopted by Hitler’s SS during the Nazi era and became particularly associated with the SS-Totenkopfverbande, the branch responsible for guarding concentration camps, according to the Anti-Defamation League.Graham Platner is a Marine and US Army veteran, oyster farmer, and chair of the Sullivan Planning Board, now running for US Senate in Maine to challenge Susan Collins and reclaim the seat for working Mainers.After graduating high school in 2003, amid the Iraq War, Graham secretly took his birth certificate from his father’s office to enlist in the US Marine Corps. Following infantry training, he joined Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion 8th Marines, and deployed to Al-Anbar Province, Iraq, in January 2005, operating primarily east of Fallujah. In 2006, he served as a machine gun section leader in Ramadi’s Government Center and returned for a third deployment in 2007.Using the GI Bill, Graham enrolled at George Washington University after his deployments, but his military service wasn’t over. In 2009, he joined the Maryland Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 as a rifle team leader.Returning from Afghanistan in 2011, Graham resumed studies at George Washington University but struggled with undiagnosed PTSD and combat-related physical challenges. He eventually withdrew and moved back to Maine, where he used VA resources to get the support he needed.After four overseas tours and growing disillusionment with America’s foreign policy, Graham shifted his focus to serving his local community. In 2018, he began working at a friend’s small oyster farm in Sullivan, Maine, and eventually took it over, growing it into a thriving business. He also started a diving and mooring service for the bay and serves as Sullivan’s Harbormaster and Planning Board Chair.In 2023, Graham met Amy Gertner, fell in love, and married her soon after. The couple lives in Sullivan—just three doors down from where Graham grew up—with their two dogs, Gryffin and Zevon, and their cat, Neptune.","Graham Platner, the Democratic Senate hopeful from Maine, expressed regret over getting a tattoo that appears similar to a Nazi symbol nearly two decades ago and posted it on Reddit.

A man from New York, who was pardoned by US President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York State Police said.34-year-old Christopher Moynihan was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with making terrorist like threats. He is the first pardoned Capitol rioter to face arrest over alleged political violence, reports ABC News.Investigators said Moynihan sent threatening text messages last week to an unidentified recipient. One message read, “Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.” Another said, “Even if I am hated he must be eliminated. I will kill him for the future.” The complaint said the messages “placed the recipient in reasonable fear of the imminent murder and assassination of Hakeem Jeffries by the defendant. ”Moynihan appeared in the Town of Clinton Court and was sent to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center with $10,000 cash bail. He is due to appear in Dutchess County State Supreme Court on Thursday.Jeffries said in a statement on Tuesday, “I am grateful to state and federal law enforcement for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out.”Moynihan was convicted in 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding after breaking through a security perimeter and entering the Capitol on January 6. Prosecutors said he went into the Senate Gallery, looked through a notebook on a senator’s desk, and took photos with his cellphone. During the riot, he reportedly said, “There’s got to be something in here we can f---ing use against these ----bags.” He was sentenced to nearly two years in prison in February 2023 before receiving a pardon from Trump, along with more than 1,500 others who were convicted or charged in connection with the attack.Jeffries warned of rising political violence but said he would not be intimidated. “When it comes to these extremists out there, you better watch how you talk when you talk about me,” he said, adding, “we're living in a moment of extreme political violence” affecting public servants.","34-year-old Christopher Moynihan was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with making terrorist like threats.

​3 Migrants DEAD in 12 Days: Trump’s ICE Detention Nightmare Exposed Amid Allegations of Abuse





A US Marshal and an undocumented immigrant were shot during a federal operation in South Los Angeles on Tuesday, reports Fox 11.Both sustained injuries that are not considered life-threatening and were taken to the hospital for treatment.The incident occurred around 8:50 am in the 400 block of E. 20th Street in the Historic South-Central neighbourhood. Federal agents had surrounded a vehicle containing the suspect. Sources told Fox News that officers opened fire when the suspect allegedly rammed federal vehicles in an attempt to escape.The marshal was reportedly shot in the finger while the suspect was hit in the left arm. The Los Angeles police department confirmed that none of its officers were involved in the shooting.

The [undocumented immigrant] weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots. The [undocumented immigrant] was shot in the elbow and one law enforcement officer was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet. Both are in the hospital.""The statement added, ""These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge [undocumented immigrants] to resist arrest. Resisting arrest puts the safety of [undocumented immigrants], law enforcement, and the public at risk. Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicle rammings by [undocumented immigrants].

The plane was only about 40 miles into its 1,300-mile trip when the incident occurred.The misunderstanding began when the pilots lost contact with the cabin crew due to a glitch with the intercom system. “After landing, it was determined there was a problem with the inter-phone system and the flight crew was knocking on the cockpit door,” the Federal Aviation Administration said.Hearing banging on the cockpit door and static over the intercom, the pilots feared a hijacking attempt. They swiftly turned the plane around and landed safely at Eppley Airfield in Omaha around 7:45 pm local time. Law enforcement was seen boarding the aircraft shortly after landing.The captain later apologised to passengers over the intercom. “We weren’t sure if something was going on with the airplane, so that’s why we’re coming back here,” he said.“It’s gonna be a little bit.

Late-night host Stephen Colbert and former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a tense exchange onon Monday night over Joe Biden ’s health and claims that the Democratic Party turned its back on him, reports Fox News.Jean-Pierre appeared on the show to promote her new book, where she spoke about feeling let down by how Democrats handled Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race. But Colbert pressed her about the former president’s visible decline in the months leading up to the June 2024 debate.“It was very personal for those of us who watched it too, because it was a shock to our system to see that,” Colbert said. “Because — I mean, you’re talking to a guy who helped raise $25 million for Joe Biden in March of that same year. And three months later, I saw a guy who I had not seen backstage at the benefit that I did. It seemed like a dramatically different person. And at 81 years old, that’s not entirely unexpected. You can imagine why people got so worried. ”Jean-Pierre defended Biden, saying she saw him daily and believed he was fully capable of leading.She added that she grew disillusioned with the party’s actions after the debate, saying she could no longer “stomach” being part of it.But Colbert didn’t let up. “I’m not questioning his heart or his policies, but it takes more than that to be the president of the United States,” he said. “And in a moment of great pressure on stage, we saw someone shock us and worry us. And nothing could assuage that worry. So I don’t think it was necessarily a betrayal of Joe Biden as other people saying, ‘We don’t think we were shown the Joe Biden that you saw.’”Jean-Pierre admitted that Biden’s debate performance was “disappointing.” Colbert replied, “Disappointment is such a light term. It was harrowing.”Earlier in the day, Jean-Pierre appeared on, where hosts Tony Dokoupil and Gayle King also challenged her defence of Biden. Dokoupil asked why she was “angry at the people who tried to push him out,” while King said she found it “hard to understand” how Jean-Pierre, who was on the plane to the debate, hadn’t noticed signs of decline.","Stephen Colbert and former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a tense exchange on Monday night over Joe Biden’s health and claims that the Democratic Party turned its back on him.Jean-Pierre appeared on the show to promote her new book, where she spoke about feeling let down by how Democrats handled Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124728127,imgsize-868721,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties





Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

A new kind of threat







An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser.

‘Evidence Clear’: Afghanistan Condemns Pakistan Over Airstrike That Killed 3 Players in Paktika





Afghanistan’s defence minister, Mullah Yaqoob, has denied claims that India played any role in the recent clashes between Afghanistan and Pakistan In an interview with Al Jazeera, Yaqoob called the allegations baseless. “These claims are baseless. Afghanistan has never allowed its territory to be used by another country. We are an independent nation, and our relations with India and Pakistan are guided solely by national interest,” he said.Violence erupted on October 11, just days after explosions in Kabul during a rare visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to India. Soon after, Taliban fighters launched attacks along the southern border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad's response.Pakistan blamed India for the border incidents with Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, saying that the Taliban leadership was “sitting in India’s lap” and warning of a “heavy price” for cross-border terrorism.Responding to this, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures.Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.

PM Sushila Karki Vows Stability and Transparency While Briefing Diplomats on Nepal’s Polls





Nepal’s deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Sunday accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” and claimed it was not serious about conducting the general election scheduled for March 5, 2026.During his first interaction with editors and senior journalists in Kathmandu since his ouster, Oli said his party, the CPN-UML, would seek reinstatement of the dissolved House of Representatives. He alleged that the government was attempting to arrest him “by hook or crook,” despite lacking sufficient grounds.Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government over corruption and a ban on social media. Former top judge Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister on September 12, and President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved parliament on her recommendation. The next general election is scheduled for March 5, 2026.Referring to his removal from office, Oli said that after he was rescued by the Nepal Army from the Prime Minister’s residence at Baluwatar following the attack by protesters, his mobile phone was seized for a few days.He also criticised the government for withdrawing some of his security personnel, saying it had failed to ensure a secure atmosphere for free and fair elections.The former prime minister claimed that during his tenure, “the law and order situation was better and the press was more secure,” adding that now “the media has become insecure and they have started self-censorship.” He accused the media of ignoring “the vandalism and arson done in the name of the Gen Z group that destroyed many important government buildings, including the Prime Minister’s Office at Singhdurbar, the Supreme Court, Parliament Building and the anti-graft body,"" as quoted by PTI.Oli alleged that the violence during the Gen Z protests was caused by “infiltration of external elements,” though he did not specify who they were. The Gen Z protesters had demanded the arrest of then Prime Minister Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, holding them responsible for the excessive use of force during the agitation.Commenting on the “Nepo-kids” movement launched by Gen Z youths alongside their protests, Oli said, “I couldn’t accept the Nepo-babe campaign launched by the Gen Z youths, which created terror among the Nepalese people.” The campaign had targeted the children of influential leaders for their lavish lifestyles allegedly funded by corruption.Unlike other top leaders, including Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-Maoist Centre chair Pushpakamal Dahal “Prachanda,” who resigned from their party posts, Oli said he had no plans to step down as CPN-UML chair. “I may come back to power if people vote for me. The country and my party still need me, and I am still capable of contributing to the country and the society,” he said.After hiding in an army camp outside Kathmandu following his ouster, Oli stayed in Gundu, Bhaktapur district, for a few weeks before reappearing publicly during a central committee meeting of his party recently, reported PTI.",Nepal's deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government.

US added to global watchlist over 'significant deterioration' in civic conditions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-added-to-global-watchlist-over-significant-deterioration-in-civic-conditions/articleshow/118868488.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

The United States has been added to the Civicus Monitor Watchlist , alleging decline in civic freedom under Trump administration. Civicus, a global civil rights watchdog that tracks civic freedoms across 198 countries, released its first watchlist of 2025 on Monday, citing 'significant deterioration' of civil liberties in the US.The US inclusion stems from what Civicus describes as systematic challenges to democratic principles and international cooperation under the Trump administration, reported the Guardian. The organisation cited specific actions, including widespread federal employee dismissals, strategic appointments of Trump supporters, withdrawal from international bodies, aid freezing, and attempts to dismantle USAID.The organisation expressed particular concern about restrictions on pro-Palestinian demonstrations and unprecedented control over media access to presidential briefings.Alongside the US, the latest list includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Italy, Pakistan, and Serbia. Previously, it listed nations such as Zimbabwe, Argentina, El Salvador and the United Arab Emirates. According to Mandeep Tiwana, co-secretary general of Civicus, the watchlist evaluates nations where civic space conditions are deteriorating, particularly regarding freedoms of peaceful assembly, association and expression. “Restrictive executive orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana said in a statment justifying the decision.Civicus characterised the behaviour of Trump after assuming presidency as an ""unparalleled attack on the rule of law"" unseen ""since the days of McCarthyism in the twentieth century"". The organisation further stated that such presidential actions undermine the fundamental democratic principle of checks and balances.Apart from the recent addition to watchlist, the US currently holds a ""narrowed"" rating on the Civicus Monitor's five-tier classification system (open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed and closed). Under Trump's previous term, the rating had declined to ""obstructed"" following responses to Black Lives Matter protests and restrictive environmental protest legislation. Though it improved under Biden's leadership, being back to ""narrowed"", Civicus now suggests the country may return to ""obstructed"" status.Tiwana claimed that while the US traditionally championed democracy and fundamental freedoms in its foreign policy, recent administrative actions risk emboldening authoritarian regimes globally.","Civicus, a global civil rights watchdog that tracks civic freedoms across 198 countries, released its first watchlist of 2025 on Monday.

"US stocks dive, Bitcoin stumbles as Trump’s ‘recession’ remark stokes fears",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-stocks-dive-bitcoin-stumbles-as-trumps-recession-remark-stokes-fears/articleshow/118867154.cms,"Trump refuses to rule out recession, says economy in ‘transition’ amid market turmoil



Economic indicators raise alarms



US markets suffered a sharp selloff on Monday as investor concerns deepened over President Donald Trump's economic policies , triggering steep losses in stocks and Bitcoin. The downturn followed Trump's refusal to rule out the possibility of a recession, unsettling markets already on edge over his tariff-driven trade agenda .All three major stock indices opened lower and extended their declines throughout the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points after earlier falling over 1,100 points. The S&P 500 lost 2.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 4%, marking its worst single-day performance since September 2022.According to a Reuters report, Trump’s tariff policies have rattled investors, wiping out $4 trillion from the S&P 500’s peak last month. Technology stocks bore the brunt of the selloff, pushing the Nasdaq deeper into correction territory. The S&P 500 closed 8.6% below its February 19 peak. Major tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), posted losses. Tesla tumbled 15.4%, extending its year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, amid falling sales in Europe and backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s ties to the Trump administration.""The stock market is losing its confidence in the Trump 2.0 policies,"" said Ed Yardeni, President of Yardeni Research. Market strategist Anthony Saglimbene of Ameriprise added, ""President Trump’s comments not necessarily taking a recession off the table unnerved investors who were already unnerved.""Bitcoin also saw a steep decline, plunging to around $78,000—its lowest level since November—as investors moved away from high-risk assets. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often called Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged to its highest level of the year.The White House sought to downplay market concerns, insisting that Trump’s economic policies would drive long-term growth. White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""Since President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs.""Despite these assurances, economic warning signs persist. The stock market has suffered its worst week since the November election, and consumer confidence has weakened as inflationary pressures mount. Trump’s recent decision to double tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 20%, along with a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum set to take effect on March 12, has heightened concerns. Additionally, he has threatened a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and further levies on lumber imports.Amid rising economic uncertainty, investors flocked to safer assets, pushing the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond down to 4.225%. Market analysts are now focused on key inflation data set for release later this week to assess whether price pressures remain persistent.A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The last US recession occurred in early 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to widespread job losses and economic contraction.Trump on Sunday declined to provide a clear answer on whether the country is headed for a recession, instead offering a vague response. ""I hate to predict things like that,"" he said in an interview on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo when asked about the possibility of an economic downturn in 2025. ""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big—we're bringing wealth back to America,"" he said. ""It takes a little time.""Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more direct in dismissing concerns. ""Absolutely not,"" he told NBC when asked whether Americans should brace for an economic downturn.However, economic challenges continue to mount. The stock market just wrapped up its worst week since the November election, and consumer sentiment has declined as shoppers worry about rising prices driven by Trump’s shifting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.Adding to uncertainty, mass layoffs persist across several government agencies, with billionaire advisor Elon Musk overseeing widespread job cuts. When reporters pressed Trump again about the possibility of a recession aboard Air Force One, he responded with a noncommittal remark: ""Who knows?""The Atlanta Federal Reserve now predicts a 2.4% contraction in GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025, which would be the worst performance since the Covid-19 pandemic.Kevin Hassett, Trump's chief economic advisor, suggested on ABC that tariffs might become permanent. He explained that their duration depends on how the targeted countries respond. If they fail to meet US demands, the tariffs could remain in place as part of a new economic equilibrium, he said.In his State of the Union speech, Trump told Americans to expect ""a little disturbance"" as tariffs take effect. ""We're okay with that. It won't be much,"" he insisted.However, economic experts remain cautious. Goldman Sachs raised its estimate of a US recession in the next 12 months from 15% to 20%. Morgan Stanley also predicted weaker growth than expected.A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The last US recession occurred in early 2020 during the Covid-19 crisis, when millions lost jobs.(Inputs from Reuters and ANI)","All three major stock indices opened lower and extended their declines throughout the session.

A heated exchange unfolded when billionaire and head of department of government efficiency (DOGE) Elon Musk labelled Senator Mark Kelly , D-Ariz, a ""traitor"" following Kelly's Ukraine visit and his subsequent support for continued US assistance in the Russia-Ukraine conflict .Kelly, whose background includes service as a Nasa astronaut and Navy combat pilot during Operation Desert Storm, toured Ukraine during the weekend. After meeting Ukrainian military personnel and medical staff, he expressed on social media that his observations reinforced the necessity to ""can't give up on the Ukrainian people."" ""Just left Ukraine. What I saw proved to me we can’t give up on the Ukrainian people. Everyone wants this war to end, but any agreement has to protect Ukraine’s security and can’t be a giveaway to Putin,"" said Kelly along with a series of post about his visit and ""why it’s important we stand with Ukraine.""In response to the post, Musk gave a short reply saying, ""You are a traitor"".Later, Kelly hit back at the owner of X saying, ""Traitor?

"Four flash sales in a day! China, world’s second largest economy, hit by deflation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/four-flash-sales-in-a-day-china-worlds-second-largest-economy-hit-by-deflation-heres-why-economists-are-worried/articleshow/118840941.cms,"Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board.

What is deflation and why are economists worried?

The ongoing price decreases have negatively impacted business earnings, employee compensation and government revenue. Sustained deflation could potentially result in diminished business investments and reduced consumer spending, says a Bloomberg report.

What’s causing deflation?

Four Flash Sales in a day in China



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Rising prices or inflation is a common headache for economies around the world. But what about falling prices? Believe it or not, a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation, is just as big a concern for governments, as is inflation. And, that’s the issue that the world’s second largest economy, China, is grappling with!Recent data indicates China's consumer price index declined by 0.7% year-on-year in February, falling short of projections, whilst producer prices decreased by 2.2%, continuing a downward trend since September 2022.China’s expanding industrial capacity has contributed to export growth, yet it is simultaneously creating deflationary pressures domestically.According to a Reuters report, February's consumer price index recorded its steepest decline in 13 months, alongside persistent producer price deflation. This downturn reflects reduced seasonal demand and consumer hesitancy in spending, influenced by employment and income uncertainties.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India Following Beijing's recent pledge to enhance consumption amidst escalating US trade tensions, analysts anticipate continued deflationary pressures in China's economy, the report said.Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board. During such periods, currency value increases with time. For many years, economists have expressed concerns about deflation.Whilst deflation appears advantageous for consumers, who can buy more with their income over time, the effects of falling prices are not universally beneficial. Economists worry about how price decreases affect different economic sectors.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch! China's deepening deflationary concerns may continue beyond temporary seasonal variations, unless governmental action addresses the surplus production capacity that's affecting price levels.Financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. express concern that consumer prices might remain near negative territory throughout the year if domestic production continues to exceed consumer demand.With the People's Bank of China currently focusing on maintaining yuan stability rather than implementing monetary stimulus, addressing deflation will likely depend on policymakers' success in managing excess production capacity, the Bloomberg report said.As noted by Citigroup economists, including Xinyu Ji, whilst rebuilding consumer confidence could require several months and largely depends on property market stabilisation, China's approach to supply-side reforms would be crucial for addressing factory-level deflation.China's rising youth joblessness, at 15.7%, is affecting consumer spending. With employment and income uncertainties, Chinese shoppers are increasingly patronising discount retailers, even as industrial production grows despite weak household spending.Financial experts indicate that the growth of such discount businesses is contributing to deflationary trends, which could impact economic growth as these shops gain popularity over traditional retailers, similar to Japan's experience in the 1990s.""The broader shift toward more value-for-money purchases will play a role in deflationary pressures,"" Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING was quoted as saying by Reuters.""This sort of intense price competition likely adds some pressure on more traditional retail models as well,” Song said.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know In its report, Reuters quoted an interesting example, symptomatic of China’s deflation.At the expansive Wankelai establishment in Beijing, manager Leo Liu conducts sales through a microphone, offering increasingly substantial discounts during flash sales until he successfully sells items including a cotton jacket and a ladies' undershirt.Reflecting China's deflationary economic conditions, Liu secured a buyer for the jacket at 20 yuan, a fraction of its original 239 yuan ($33) price tag. The 39-yuan undershirt had to be given away as no customers were willing to purchase it!The store, which offers clothing, snacks and everyday household items near Beijing's financial district, conducts these sales four times daily!Widespread price reductions have emerged across sectors, from eateries offering 3-yuan breakfast deals to automotive manufacturer BYD reducing one of its vehicle prices to under $10,000.Local coffee chain Luckin has overtaken Starbucks as the market leader by offering more affordable options.","Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board.

What did the university say?



Who is Mahmoud Khalil?



ICE agents have recently arrested Mahmoud Khalil , a Palestinian activist, who completed his graduate studies at Columbia University in December. On Saturday night when ICE agents arrested him, the Columbia University Apartheid Divest leader was inside his university-owned apartment, a few blocks away from the college. Khalil was arrested for leading disruptive protests on the campus last year.""We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented sharing an article about Khalil's arrest triggering questions about whether people with green cards and visas will also be deported by the Donald Trump administration.Attorney Amy Greer said Khalil was told that he was being arrested after his student visa had been revoked but she pointed out that Khalil is a permanent resident of the US. Greer told the arresting officers about Khalil's legal status but Khalil was detained anyway.Columbia put out a statement stressing that it won't cooperate with ICE's actions except where required by law. “Consistent with our longstanding practice and the practice of cities and institutions throughout the country, law enforcement must have a judicial warrant to enter non-public university areas, including university buildings,” the statement read in part. “Columbia is committed to complying with all legal obligations and supporting our student body and campus community.”A petition demanding Khalil’s immediate release posted on Action Network garnered more than 349,000 signatures by Sunday evening.An ICE agent reportedly told Khalil’s lawyer Greer that the agency was enforcing a State Department edict to revoke Khalil’s student visa as well as his green card , pursuant to Trump’s recent pledge to deport foreign student “agitators” responsible for fomenting campus unrest.A Palestinian-American, Mahmoud Khalil was reportedly raised in a refugee camp in Syria. Before studying in Columbia, he worked for the British Embassy in Beirut. His lawyer said he is a Green Card holder and did not come to the US on a student visa. According to reports, Khalil is married, and his US-citizen wife is eight months pregnant. The couple lived in the university-owned apartment, which was raided by ICE.","Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian-American, was reportedly raised in a refugee camp in Syria.

Canada unveils 2025 express entry changes: New education category and expanded in-Canada draws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-unveils-2025-express-entry-changes-new-education-category-and-expanded-in-canada-draws/articleshow/118839902.cms,"Representative image

Key changes to express entry for 2025

The updated Express Entry categories for 2025 are:

French-language proficiency (candidates must achieve at least NCLC 7 in all language abilities on the TCF or TEF exams) Healthcare and social services occupations Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) occupations Trades occupations Agriculture and Agri-Food occupations (now reduced to a single occupation: butchers – retail and wholesale) Education occupations (newly introduced)

Expanded Occupation Lists

Healthcare and Social Services : Renamed from “Healthcare” to reflect the inclusion of additional roles such as animal health technologists, veterinary technicians, and cardiology technologists.

: Renamed from “Healthcare” to reflect the inclusion of additional roles such as animal health technologists, veterinary technicians, and cardiology technologists. Trades : Expanded significantly to include occupations such as roofers and shinglers, heavy-duty equipment mechanics, and bricklayers.

: Expanded significantly to include occupations such as roofers and shinglers, heavy-duty equipment mechanics, and bricklayers. STEM: Adjustments made to the list of eligible occupations to better align with industry needs.

New education category

Elementary and secondary school teacher assistants (NOC 43100)

Instructors of persons with disabilities (NOC 42203) [previously in the Healthcare category]

Early childhood educators and assistants (NOC 42202)

Elementary school and kindergarten teachers (NOC 41221)

Secondary school teachers (NOC 41220)

How category-based draws work

Meet the baseline eligibility requirements of Express Entry (FSWP, FSTP, or CEC);

Have at least six months of full-time experience in the last three years in a listed occupation or demonstrate French language proficiency.

Canada has announced significant updates to its Express Entry system for 2025 – this mechanism issues permanent residency invites to successful candidates. The focus of the update is to address labour shortages and enhance economic growth. Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship (IRCC), recently revealed the latest changes, including the introduction of a new education category and an increased emphasis on inviting candidates with Canadian work experience.The Express Entry system, which manages applications for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC), will prioritize candidates with work experience in Canada. The goal is to transition more temporary residents to permanent status while meeting labour demands in high-priority sectors.Category-based draws, first introduced in 2023, will continue in 2025 with an updated structure. The six original categories—French-language proficiency, healthcare, STEM, trades, transport, and agriculture and agri-food—are being revised. The transport category has been removed, while a new education category has been added to recognize the demand for teachers and early childhood educators.As covered by TOI earlier, Canada has significantly dropped its permanent residency targets as compared to earlier years. It has cut it down to 11.4 lakh permanent residents for the three year period 2025-2027. It is likely that the year 2025 will experience fewer general category draws and more category based draws and draws for CEC category.Each occupational category includes a list of professions eligible for targeted Express Entry draws. Notable changes include:The full list of eligible occupations for the 2025 Express Entry draws spans across healthcare, STEM, trades, agriculture, and education, ensuring that Canada’s evolving labour market is well supported.The introduction of the education category marks a major shift in Canada’s approach to immigration. The following five occupations are now included under this category:Category-based selection allows Canada to invite candidates who meet specific economic priorities. To qualify, candidates must:The highest-ranking candidates within each category are invited to apply for permanent residency, with the lowest ranking score required for selection published after each draw.The main advantage of the category-based draws is that the qualifying Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score tends to be lower than for the general draws.The 2025 Express Entry changes signal a major shift in Canada's immigration strategy, with a continued emphasis on healthcare, education, and Francophone immigration. The introduction of the education category, adjustments to occupation lists, and increased focus on candidates with Canadian work experience reflect Canada’s commitment to a well-managed and sustainable immigration system. Time will tell how these changes impact selection scores and overall immigration trends, but for skilled workers worldwide, the opportunity to build a future in Canada remains strong.","Canada has announced significant updates to its Express Entry system for 2025.

A mystery without closure

The search for Sudiksha Konanki , a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who vanished in the Dominican Republic last week, has taken a tragic turn. Authorities now suspect she was swept away by a powerful wave while swimming off a Punta Cana beach in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to reports by New York Post. But questions remain—was it truly an accident, or is there more to the story?Konanki, a bright pre-med student and legal US resident, had traveled with five friends from Pitt for what was supposed to be a carefree spring break in the Caribbean. On Wednesday night, she and six others strolled along the beach at the Riu República Hotel . By the time the night wound down, most of the group had left—except for Konanki and one other person, reported ABC News.Surveillance footage captured her at 4:15 am, still on the sand with a young man whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. What happened next remains a matter of investigation, but according to a police report obtained by ABC News, the two decided to take a swim, only to be caught by a massive wave.Authorities now believe Konanki drowned. Yet, with no body recovered and no definitive evidence, her family refuses to accept this as the final answer.Rescue teams launched an all-out effort to find her, deploying helicopters, drones, and boats to scour the turquoise waters of Bávaro Beach. On land, investigators combed the white sands for any sign of the missing student.The young man last seen with her was questioned by authorities, though officials have not clarified whether he is also a Pitt student. His account aligns with the drowning theory, but Konanki’s family remains unconvinced.Sudiksha’s father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has been vocal in his doubts. He traveled to the Dominican Republic, pleading with authorities to expand the investigation beyond the water.“They’re only searching the ocean, but what if she was taken? What if this wasn’t an accident?” he said. “We don’t think she could survive this long in the water, but that doesn’t mean she drowned. We need answers.”A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office in Loudoun County, Virginia, where Konanki lived, echoed similar skepticism. “The idea of her drowning is based on her last known location near the beach, but there’s no hard evidence to support that conclusion at this time.”Konanki was last seen wearing a brown bikini, bracelets on both arms, and an anklet. Authorities say there’s still no trace of her.With pressure mounting from both US and Indian officials, investigators are facing scrutiny over whether they reached a conclusion too soon. Until evidence emerges to confirm what truly happened to Sudiksha Konanki, the mystery of her disappearance continues to haunt her family, friends, and the quiet shores of Punta Cana.","Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student, vanished in the Dominican Republic last week. Authorities now suspect she was swept away by a powerful wave while swimming off a Punta Cana beach in the early hours of Thursday morning. But questions remain—was it truly an accident, or is there more to the story?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118845203,imgsize-586096,width-400,resizemode-4/118845203.jpg"

'Hope we'll be in a different place very soon': State secretary Marco Rubio signals possible resumption of US aid to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hope-well-be-in-a-different-place-very-soon-state-secretary-marco-rubio-signals-possible-resumption-of-us-aid-to-ukraine/articleshow/118865978.cms,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with the media on his military airplane as he flies to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that US aid and intelligence support to Ukraine might resume if Ukrainian leadership demonstrates 'commitment to peace negotiations'.The US administration seeks to understand potential compromises Ukraine might consider during peace negotiations to conclude the conflict with Russia, according to Rubio. “We really want to sort of ascertain where they stand on this and what they’re willing to do in order to achieve peace,” he told reporters while heading to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for a key meet with Ukraine delegation.""My hope is we'll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place very soon,"" the secretary of state added, claiming that Tuesday’s meeting “will be key” to decision on resuming military aid and intelligence sharing. “I think if we emerge there with a good meeting that we feel good about and can report back to the president, then I think decisions will be made in regards to the pause,” he further said.With regards of sharing intelligence, CNN reported that while the US continues sharing defensive intelligence with Ukraine, it has reduced sharing intelligence that could be used for offensive operations against Russian forces, according to two US defence officials.The top US diplomat indicated that Rubio and Waltz will attend meetings with Ukraine's national security adviser, foreign minister and defence minister in an observational capacity.Rubio acknowledged the Ukrainian people's significant hardships and noted that whilst discussing concessions is challenging after such suffering, it remains the sole path to preventing further casualties. He emphasised that he would not impose conditions on Ukraine's decisions. The senior US diplomat noted that Ukraine's potential concessions might not align with Russia's expectations. ""That's what we need to find out. We're not going to find out on X. We're not going to find out, you know, on media, press conferences. We have to find out in rooms that are closed,"" Rubio stated.Rubio explained that whilst the discussions would not involve specific territorial negotiations, the US aims to understand potential Ukrainian concessions, their requirements, and Russia's position on these matters to assess the extent of disagreement between the parties.This comes after the US administration halted all assistance and intelligence support to Ukraine following a contentious White House exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.The confrontation involved direct exchanges where Trump and Vance emphasised repeatedly the significance of American support to Ukraine whilst demanding acknowledgment and appreciation. Former President Joe Biden had previously expressed similar concerns to Zelenskyy during a stern telephone discussion in 2022, shortly after the invasion and subsequent US support. Zelenskyy promptly expressed public appreciation for American assistance within hours.His response to the current administration took several days. He posted a message describing the situation as ""regrettable"" on X, shortly before Trump's inaugural second-term address to Congress.""None of us wants an endless war,"" Zelensky wrote. ""Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.""","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that US aid and intelligence support to Ukraine might resume if Ukrainian leadership demonstrates 'commitment to peace negotiations' The US administration seeks to understand potential compromises Ukraine might consider during peace negotiations to conclude the conflict with Russia.

"Trump looms over Greenland’s election, but voters have other concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-looms-over-greenlands-election-but-voters-have-other-concerns/articleshow/118866356.cms,"Trump’s attention has intensified conversation about Greenland’s independence from Denmark

On Tuesday, Greenlanders will cast their votes in what has to be the most closely watched election this island has ever held, as President Trump asserts again and again that he wants the US to take over Greenland. He has refused to rule out force, and in his recent speech to Congress, he made a direct plea to the Greenlanders themselves, promising, “We will make you rich.” All the attention he has paid has drawn a wave of journalists, diplomats, social media influencers and investors to the Arctic.Greenland’s leading political parties are presenting diffe rent visions for the future, and some are pushing for a new relationship with the US and quick independence from Denmark, which colonised Greenland hundreds of years ago and still controls some of its affairs.But for many of Greenland’s 56,000 residents — a tiny population on the world’s biggest island — geopolitics is not apriority. At a recent town hall debate and in interviews with voters, Greenlanders expressed much more prosaic worries, often about living costs, unemployment, schools and health care. “The geopolitical debates might dominate headlines, but for the average voter, daily life matters more,” said Rasmus Leander Nielsen, a political scientist.People on the island say they’re worried about higher housing costs and economic uncertainty. “This election is a test of where Greenlanders see their future — both in their everyday lives and on the global stage,” Nielsen said. “The question is whether voters will prioritise immediate economic concerns or the bigger geopolitical picture. It’s a tough call.”At the heart of the election is the question of control. For over 200 years, Greenland was ruled as a distant colony of Denmark, its Inuit population largely sidelined as Danish officials controlled its land and resources. Over time, pressure for self-rule grew, leading to greater autonomy and eventually a govt of its own. Today, Greenland controls most domestic af fairs, while Denmark still oversees defence, foreign policy and monetary matters. But full independence is a challenge. Denmark’s financial support covers more than half of Greenland’s budget, making economic stability a key hurdle to sovereignty.Nearly all major parties agree that Greenland should become independent — it’s just a question of when and how. They also differ on what the island’s ultimate relationship should be with the US and Denmark. No major politicians have expressed a desire to become an American state, and polls show that 85% of Greenlanders don’t want that. But some candidates, including Kuno Fencker, a member of the Naleraq party, believe that Greenland should establish close ties with the US.The US has maintained a military presence on Greenland since WWII. “The US is here to stay,” Fencker said. Other parties, including the Demokraatit, are more cautious. “We must not push for independence at the expense of our people,” said Bo Martinsen, a Demokraatit candidate. Trump’s attention has intensified the conversation about independence and what Greenland should do if it breaks off from Denmark.","Greenlanders will cast their votes in what has to be the most closely watched election this island has ever held.

The US Senate confirmed Lori Chavez-DeRemer as the labour secretary in Trump administration on Monday. In this role, she will enforce federally mandated worker protections whilst the White House aims to reduce government staff numbers.She will lead the Department of Labour, which is involved in legal challenges regarding Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency's authority over redundancies and data access.The Labour Department, with nearly 16,000 full-time staff and a proposed budget of $13.9 billion for fiscal year 2025, has extensive duties. These include publishing unemployment figures, workplace safety regulation, investigating wage disputes, and enforcing laws on union organisation.Major labour unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, supported Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. A former Republican congresswoman from Oregon and a Teamster's daughter, she developed a pro-labour reputation during her House term.The Senate approved her nomination 67-32, making her among the last of Trump's Cabinet confirmations.The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labour & Pensions voted 14-9 for her nomination. All Republicans except Sen. Rand Paul supported her, alongside three Democrats: Sens. John Hickenlooper, Tim Kaine and Maggie Hassan.During committee hearings, Republican senators questioned her about co-sponsoring legislation supporting worker unionisation and penalising resistant employers. She avoided directly addressing her stance on the Protecting the Right to Organize Act ( PRO Act ), explaining her co-sponsorship as a means to participate in labour discussions. She later affirmed support for state ""right to work"" laws.Chavez-DeRemer also supported legislation protecting public-sector workers' Social Security benefits from pension-related reductions. Regarding minimum wage, she acknowledged its stagnation at $7.25 since 2009 but expressed concerns about economic impact.Democratic senators have raised concerns about her independence under President Trump's administration, which has terminated numerous federal employees.","Lori Chavez-DeRemer is a former Republican congresswoman from Oregon.

US Border Czar Tom Homan on Monday criticised Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett for claiming that ""it’s not a crime to enter our country illegally,"" despite the act being a violation of federal law .""It’s really pathetic that any member of Congress doesn’t understand what the law says! It’s a crime to enter this country illegally, and we’re gonna enforce those laws,"" Tom Homan said in an interview on Fox News.These remarks came after the Democratic representative appeared on 'The Katie Phang Show' on MSNBC to discuss her role in a House Committee hearing on sanctuary city policies last week, where she told the viewers that illegally entering the United States is not a ""crime"" but rather a ""civil violation,"" arguing that undocumented immigrants should not be classified as criminals.""[Republicans] are so outraged by these immigrants and the crime that they’re bringing. And not to mention, city law enforcement, local law enforcement, they are always going after crime,"" Crockett said.""And they don’t say, ‘oh, you committed a murder, oh, but you’re an immigrant. Well, let me let you go.’ Right? So they are always focused on crime,"" she added.Crockett further elaborated on her position regarding illegal entry stating: ""They continue to say things like ‘the illegals’ and that they broke the law coming in. But what they’re not telling the American people is that it is a civil violation.""""It is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally. It’s not. It’s not criminal. It’s not a crime.

Three Sindhi barbers killed in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/three-sindhi-barbers-killed-in-balochistan/articleshow/118859410.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop in Panjgur district of Pakistan’s volatile southwestern Baluchistan province, police said on Monday.Baluchistan has in recent years witnessed a sharp increase in targeted killings of non-Baluch inhabitants, including barbers, commuters, and workers from other provinces, particularly Punjab. Ethnic Baluch separatist militants accuse non-Baluch residents of spying for the Pakistani military, against which they have waged an insurgency.The victims of the latest incident hailed from Mirpurkhas and Jacobabad districts in southern Sindh province“Three Sindhi barbers lost their lives in a targeted attack in Gowargo area of Panjgur district,” Muhammad Zaid, a police officer in Panjgur district, said. The gunmen arrived on a motorbike, entered the barber shop late Sunday evening, opened fire and then fled, police said.The victims’ bodies were moved to a local hospital for post-mortem examinations before being sent to their hometowns.Shahid Rind, Baluchistan govt spokesperson, described the attack as barbaric and intended to sow discord among provinces.No group has claimed the attack. The separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) had accepted responsibility for similar attacks in the past. BLA is the most active group in the region; it accuses outsiders of exploiting the rich resources of their province.Last month, militants had executed seven Punjabi labourers after stopping a bus on a highway in Baluchistan and identifying where the passengers were from.Eleven Punjabi labourers were killed after being abducted from a bus in the city of Naushki in April last year, while seven Punjabi barbers were killed a month later near Gwadar Port in the restive province.","Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop.

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

Trump's Rare Praise For Pakistan; Big Reveal On Killing Of 13 US Troops In 2021 Kabul Attack

US President Donald Trump in his first address to Congress mentioned Pakistan's cooperation in arresting Mohammad Shareefullah , a key terrorist involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.

In this effort, Pakistan has rendered great sacrifices, including the lives of over 80,000 of our brave soldiers and citizens,"" he said.""The resolve of our leadership and our people remains unflinching in eradicating the menace of terrorism from our country.

""This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, whom I actually got to know very well, whose children were murdered. What a horrible day,"" Trump said.The special mention of Pakistan came after the administration recently authorised $397 million for Pakistan for its F-16 fighter jet fleet -- signalling a possible shift in policy.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar.

Scuffle occurs outside Chinese Embassy in India as Tibetans mark uprising anniversary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/scuffle-occurs-outside-chinese-embassy-in-india-as-tibetans-mark-uprising-anniversary/articleshow/118845472.cms,"Tibetan scuffle breaks out with police outside Chinese embassy in India

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India.Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag. The demonstrators observed a minute of silence to remember Tibetans who lost their lives in the struggle against China. Monks, activists, nuns and schoolchildren marched across the town with banners reading, ""Free Tibet"" and ""Remember, Resist, Return.""Penpa Tsering - the president of the Central Tibetan Administration, as the exiled Tibetan government calls itself - accused China's leadership of carrying out a ""deliberate and dangerous strategy to eliminate the very identity of the Tibetan people.""""This marks the darkest and most critical period in the history of Tibet,"" Tsering told the gathering. ""As we commemorate the Tibetan National Uprising Day, we honor our brave martyrs, and express solidarity with our brothers and sisters inside Tibet who continue to languish under the oppressive Chinese government.""The Tibetan government-in-exile in India accuses China of denying the most fundamental human rights to people in Tibet and trying to expunge the Tibetan identity .China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but the Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent until China occupied it in 1950.The Dalai Lama denies China's claim that he is a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.","Tibetans living in exile mark the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

Bangladesh sees 'troubling' rise in cases of rape and assault on women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-sees-troubling-rise-in-cases-of-rape-and-assault-on-women/articleshow/118809920.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

A massive rescue operation is underway after an oil tanker and a cargo ship collided in the North Sea off the East Yorkshire coast on Monday, sparking a massive fire and injuring 32 people.According to the BBC, the incident occurred near the Humber Estuary, with HM Coastguard receiving the alert at 09.48 GMT. Multiple lifeboats and a Coastguard helicopter were dispatched to the scene.The incident, which took place near the port city of Hull, has resulted in 32 casualties being brought ashore, while some crew members remain unaccounted for, according to Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East. Boyers further described the incident as a ""massive fireball.""The vessels involved were identified as the US-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker , which had transported petroleum products from Greece, and the Portuguese-flagged Solong container ship, owned by German company Reederei Koepping, according to Marine Traffic data.Videos circulating online showed a massive plume of thick, black smoke and flames billowing from the site, located approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) offshore.Erik Hanell, chief executive of Stena Bulk, told BBC that all crew members aboard Stena Immaculate were safe and accounted for. Earlier, the RNLI reported ""that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships"".""It's too far out for us to see - about 10 miles - but we have seen the vessels bringing them in. They must have sent a mayday out - luckily there was a crew transfer vessel out there already,"" Boyers said.""Since then there has been a flotilla of ambulances to pick up anyone they can find.

FBI Releases Video Footage Of Charlie Kirk’s Killer; Trump Demands Death Penalty





At an emotional news conference on Friday, Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time since the assasination of her husband, conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.At the beginning, Erika addressed US president Donald Trump and said, “My husband loved you, and he knew you loved him too. Your friendship was amazing.”She thanked vice president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance for standing by her family. “You honoured my husband so well, bringing him home. You are tremendous,” she said, calling them “dear friends” of her husband.Erika, who fought back tears several times during her address, further said her husband “laid down his life for me, for our nation, for our children,” and prayed that “Charlie be received into the merciful arms of Jesus, our loving Saviour.”Speaking about his life, she recalled how Charlie wanted to be remembered for “his courage and his faith.” She said he loved America, nature, and sports, especially the Chicago Cubs and Oregon Ducks.But above all, “Charlie loved his children, and he loved me with all of his heart, and I knew that every day,” she added.Erika recalled how two days ago, her husband went to see ""the face of his saviour and his God."" ""One of the last conversations he had on this earth was witnessing for his lord and saviour, Jesus Christ,” she said.She also called out those responsible for his killing. “The evildoers who assassinated my husband have no idea what they have done. They killed Charlie because he preached a message of patriotism, faith, and God’s merciful love. If you thought his mission was powerful before, you have no idea what you have unleashed across this country and within this wife,” she said.“In a world filled with chaos, doubt and uncertainty, my husband’s voice will remain and it will ring out louder and more clearly than ever and his wisdom will endure,” she said.Erika also spoke directly to her late husband, saying, “Charlie, baby. Charlie, I promise, I will never let your legacy die. I won’t. I’ll make TPUSA the biggest thing this nation has ever seen. I promise. Charlie, I love you. I love you, baby. Rest in the arms of our lord.”Erika also shared the painful moment of telling her three-year-old daughter why her father was not coming home. “Where’s daddy?” What do you tell a 3-year-old? I said, “Baby, daddy loves you so much. He’s on a work trip with Jesus,"" Erika said.Erika praised local, state and federal authorities for moving quickly to capture the suspect in Kirk’s killing. “They worked tirelessly to capture my husband’s assassin so that he could be brought to justice,” she said.Charlie Kirk, co-founder of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon.","Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time since the assasination of her husband, conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.

The White House on Friday shared a tribute video for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed earlier this week in Utah.The post was captioned, “In loving memory of Charlie Kirk, a fearless patriot and man of unwavering faith who dedicated his life to America. ‘It’s bigger than you, I want you to remember that… It’s bigger than me – you are here to make somebody else’s life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom. ’”The video played clips of Kirk along with audio from his earlier speeches. He said, “Only in America is it possible to say, you know what, I don’t like the way the country is going, and to do something about it. Take that risk, take that leap of faith, stay involved, trust God, and act obediently.”He said that God uses all things for good for those who love him. He added, “It’s bigger than you. I want you to remember, it is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me. You are here to make somebody else’s life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom.”Kirk spoke about drawing strength from the “hundreds of thousands” who supported him. ""You are here to make somebody else's life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom.You know what gives me strength? The hundreds of thousands of you that say, Charlie, keep going.He also pointed to what he called “evidence” of Jesus Christ.

FBI Releases Video Footage Of Charlie Kirk’s Killer; Trump Demands Death Penalty





Police evacuated the neighborhood around Tyler Robinson’s family home in Utah on Friday, just hours after the 22-year-old was identified as the suspect accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a college event.According to Fox News, officers received “concerning information” from the residence, though investigators did not specify what triggered the response. Videos from the scene showed dozens of police cars, officers on the ground, and a helicopter circling overhead.The evacuation came the same day Robinson was taken into custody. He faces multiple felony charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and discharging a firearm causing serious injury, according to a probable cause affidavit.Authorities say Robinson shot and killed Kirk, 31, co-founder of Turning Point USA, while Kirk was speaking to students at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Kirk was rushed to a hospital and later died. The FBI and state officials said the attack was targeted, fueling concerns about political violence.Governor Spencer Cox confirmed Robinson “acted alone” and said the suspect had grown more political and increasingly hostile toward conservative figures in recent years.At the time of his arrest, he was wearing clothing that matched surveillance images released earlier in the week. Ammunition recovered at the scene carried engravings linked to internet meme culture and references to fascism, according to Cox.State and federal records show Robinson is registered to vote in Utah with no party affiliation. He was listed as inactive after missing the last two general elections and had no prior criminal history.Robinson grew up in a suburb of St George, about three and a half hours from the Utah Valley University campus. He was raised in a close household by parents who have been married for about 25 years, run a granite countertop business, and are registered Republicans. Robinson has two younger brothers, reported AP.","Police evacuated the neighborhood around Tyler Robinson's family home on Friday.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.","Albania has appointed an AI-powered minister to fight corruption.

US condemns decision, warns of response



Divided Brazil, inflamed politics



Bolsonaro’s future







Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Thursday after the country’s Supreme Court convicted him of attempting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The unprecedented ruling handed down by a panel of five justices, four of whom voted to convict, makes Bolsonaro the first former Brazilian leader found guilty of trying to overturn a democratic election. He was convicted on five counts, including plotting to abolish the rule of law, belonging to an armed criminal organisation, and inciting violence.Bolsonaro, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, remains under house arrest in Brasilia. He can still appeal the decision. The court now has 60 days to publish the ruling, after which his lawyers will have five days to file motions for clarification. Legal experts say such appeals rarely change outcomes.The ruling immediately sparked international backlash, most notably from Washington. US President Donald Trump said he was “very unhappy” with the conviction, calling Bolsonaro “outstanding.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio denounced the ruling as a “witch hunt” in a post on X, vowing the Trump administration would “respond accordingly.”The United States had already slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian goods earlier this year, citing the case against Bolsonaro — a move analysts say foreshadowed further sanctions.In Brazil, the trial has inflamed political tensions. Supporters of the far-right leader have taken to the streets, claiming the case is political persecution. His eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict a “supreme persecution,” insisting history would vindicate his father.Justice Cármen Lúcia, siding with the majority, said she was persuaded by evidence from the Attorney General’s Office. “He is the instigator, the leader of an organisation that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,” she said. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case, branded Bolsonaro the head of a criminal coup plot.President Lula said Thursday that “hundreds of pieces of evidence” showed Bolsonaro attempted a coup against Brazil’s democracy.Bolsonaro is already barred from running for office until 2030 in a separate case, but he remains an influential figure in Brazilian politics. Observers expect him to back a political heir to challenge Lula in the next election.Despite Thursday’s ruling, Bolsonaro will not immediately go to prison. But with appeals unlikely to succeed and diplomatic tensions rising, Brazil now faces a volatile period of political and international fallout.","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison.

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step. Here’s how the process works:","UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID in one step. Age-based validity auto-assigned through ICP’s digital platforms.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

Redestricting row: Missouri legislature approves new GOP plan; Trump hails 'show me state',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/redestricting-row-missouri-legislature-approves-new-gop-plan-trump-hails-show-me-state/articleshow/123860949.cms,"Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin, R-Shelbina, second from left, signs legislation at the dais in Jefferson City, Moi (AP)





Missouri’s state legislature has passed a plan to redraw the state’s congressional map, turning Democratic Rep Emanuel Cleaver’s district into a Republican-leaning seat. The move is part of a nationwide battle over redistricting ahead of next year’s midterm elections.The new map will carve up Cleaver’s Kansas City-area district in an effort to create a new Republican seat. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, is expected to sign the plan into law. Kehoe called the special session after US President Donald Trump encouraged Republican-led states to consider mid-decade redistricting to strengthen the party’s majority in the House.US President Donald Trump celebrated the new map, writing on Truth Social that he hoped it would yield an additional GOP seat. “It is wonderful to see Republicans in the “Show Me State” standing up to Save our Country, and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” he said.Democrats criticised the plan as an effort to boost Trump’s political margin and dilute Black voters’ influence in Kansas City. House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called the redistricting scheme a Trump-led effort, saying, “Missouri values, what a disingenuous notion… the only way he can win is to cheat.”Missouri is the third state this year to pass legislation for mid-cycle redistricting, following Texas, where Republicans redrew maps to gain additional seats. California Democrats have also moved to temporarily override the state’s independent commission in November, aiming to gain five seats. Other states, including Indiana, are considering similar proposals.Opponents of Missouri’s new map have already filed a lawsuit challenging the lines and are exploring a citizen referendum to reject the map in a statewide vote.The legislation passed quickly through the GOP-controlled House and Senate, despite protests from Democrats and outside groups in Jefferson City.

An ambitious and hardworking 50-year-old Indian-origin man's dream of setting up a hospitality chain in the US was snuffed out this week in a manner as ghastly as it was tragic. Dallas motel manager Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, whose roots are in Andhra Pradesh's Dharmavaram, was beheaded on Sept 10 in front of his wife and son, allegedly by a co-worker who took umbrage at his boss getting another person to translate instructions.The suspect, 37-year-old Cuban co-worker Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, has been arrested and charged with capital murder, according to the Dallas police department.Cobos-Martinez reportedly became enraged when Mouli asked another person to relay his instructions to Coboz over using a broken washing machine instead of addressing him directly.The workplace spat that ended Mouli's life occurred just as he was planning a trip to India in Oct to meet his mother and sibling.Mouli spent much of his life in Bengaluru, studying, working and trying his hand at several businesses in the city before moving to the US. He had been based in Dallas for the past five years, running the motel owned by an NRI from Gujarat.Suresh Kumar, a former neighbour at Bengaluru's RT Nagar, said Chandra Mouli never made a secret of his desire to go to the US.One morning in 2018, Mouli declared he was flying to US. From 2018 to 2021, he was in San Antonio before moving to Dallas.He would show his house and motel during regular video calls. Sometimes, Nisha (Mouli's wife) would speak to my wife and invite us to US,"" Suresh Kumar, a former neighbour told TOI.""Mouli dreamt of settling in Texas. I was shocked when someone knocked on my door at 7pm on Thursday to narrate what happened,"" he told TOI.Texas had been on Mouli's radar because his elder sister and brother-in-law were already running a hospitality business there. Sailas Nulaka, a classmate from primary school and a friend of three decades, said it was beyond belief that someone as gentle as Mouli, aka Molly, would be killed in such a brutal manner. ""He was the humblest friend I have known,"" he said.Abilash Reddy, another childhood friend from Thippasandra and a former corporator, described Mouli's family as ""highly respectable"" and loved. ""About two years ago, they renovated their house and turned it into a PG. They have always been kind and generous, which is why it is so shocking that something of this magnitude has happened to them.""A fundraiser on GoFundMe.com for Mouli's funeral and to support his 18-year-old son Gaurav's education - the teenager is set to enrol for an undergraduate course in hospitality management - mopped up over $85,000 in just over 48 hours.

A major political row started as Indian-American politicians were named and shamed on social media for not condemning the horrific incident that took place in Dallas where an Indian-origin man, Chandra Nagamalliah, was beheaded by his employee Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, an illegal Cuban immigrant. Martinez was asked not to use a particular broken washing machine but he was not directly asked. Another employee was asked to translate for him.Cobos-Martinez chased Nagamalliah with a machete and then decapitated him, and kicked the head. He was arrested. The killer has a criminal record and Cuba already told the US that they would not accept him. But he continued to remain in the US and was employed by Nagamallaiah.According to the affidavit, Cobos-Martinez admitted to the killing in an interview with authorities. The affidavit cited a video and said it captured Cobos-Martinez leaving the motel room, producing a machete and repeatedly cutting and stabbing Nagamallaiah.Screaming, Nagamallaiah fled to the motel's front office, but Cobos-Martinez followed and continued to cut him, according to the affidavit. At one point, the victim's wife and son tried to stop Cobos-Martinez, but he pushed them away and continued assaulting Nagamallaiah, it said.Cobos-Martinez removed a key card and a cellphone from Nagamallaiah's pockets and continued cutting the victim ""until his head was removed from his body"". He kicked Nagamallaiah’s head into the parking lot, then picked it up and put it in a dumpster, the affidavit said.Social media users questioned why the Indian-American politicians from both parties, including Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Shri Thanedar, Vivek Ramaswamy, did not condemn the incident. ""When it’s time for virtue signaling, they’re loud. When it’s time to stand up, they go silent,"" one wrote.""No outrage here, unlike Iryna Zarutska or Charlie Kirk, because the victim, Chandra Nagamalliah, was a Brown man of Indian origin and not of the favoured skin colour; otherwise, the USA would be jumping up and down,"" another wrote.The Consulate General of India, Houston, condoled the death of Nagamallaiah. ""We are in touch with the family and offering all possible assistance. The accused is in the custody of Dallas Police. We are following up on the matter closely,"" it said.","Indian-American politicians slammed for their silence over the gruesome beheading of Chandra Nagamallaiah in Dallas.

An immigration and customs enforcement officer fatally shot a man Friday in Franklin Park, a suburb about 18 miles west of Chicago.The department of homeland security said officers were trying to arrest the man, who had a history of reckless driving. The suspect refused orders and drove his car at them, hitting and dragging one of the officers. The officer then opened fire, perceiving a threat to his life.Both the officer and the suspect were taken to a local hospital. The suspect was pronounced dead, while the officer is being treated for injuries.“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, as quoted by The New York Post.The shooting occurred less than a week into “Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement operation ICE is conducting in Chicago.McLaughlin said that “viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement” have made officers’ work more dangerous.","Homeland security officers were trying to arrest the man, who had a history of reckless driving.

What is the Charlie Kirk show ?



Charlie Kirk's last 24 hours







Charlie Kirk's show went live Friday morning as his killer, Tyler Robinson, was taken into custody on several charges, including aggravated murder. ""Charlie would've wanted us to be here. He would've been upset if we weren't here. We've left his chair open and empty, because nobody could ever fill it,"" his friends said on the show, leaving his chair empty.The Friday episode of Charlie Kirk was a journey down memory lane about the 31-year-old Conservative activist -- by his friends Jack, Tyler, Blake and Andrew. They were all in tears as they were speaking about Charlie Kirk.Kirk was shot in the neck as he was speaking at Utah Valley University. He was taken to a hospital where he died. The manhunt went on for two days and finally Tyler Robinson was turned in to the police by his father after the shooter suspect confessed to having killed Charlie Kirk to his father. No clear motive has been established as Tyler has not been speaking to the cops. But his family members confirmed that he had grown more political recently. Tyler was openly voicing his dislike for KirkReports confirmed that Tyler was registered in Utah as an unaffiliated voter.He was also listed as ""inactive,"" indicating he had not participated in recent elections, including the November presidential contest, the first since he became eligible to vote.It is a daily podcast which used to be hosted by Charlie Kirk. Kirk used to comment on the latest news and any other culture and current events, along with a MAGA guest.Moments before he was shot dead, Charlie Kirk was speaking about the Bible. ""It’s not just intrabiblical evidence, but extrabiblical evidence that Jesus Christ was a real person, he lived a perfect life, he was crucified, died and rose on the third day, and he is Lord and God over all,"" Kirk said at the event where he was later shot.Charlie Kirk's last X post was on Iryna Zarutska, the Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train. ""If we want things to change, it’s 100% necessary to politicize the senseless murder of Iryna Zarutska because it was politics that allowed a savage monster with 14 priors to be free on the streets to kill her,"" he wrote.","Charlie Kirk's show went live Friday morning as his killer, Tyler Robinson, was taken into custody on several charges, including aggravated murder.

US President Donald Trump gave an unexpected response Friday morning when asked about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Kirk, 31, co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while speaking to students at Utah Valley University on Thursday. He was rushed to a hospital and later died. The FBI and state officials said the attack was targeted, heightening concerns about political violence.During an interview, a reporter asked Trump how he was holding up following the incident.“How are you holding up over the last three and a half days?” asked the reporter.Trump replied, “I think very good,” before quickly changing the topic to the White House ballroom. “And by the way, right there you see all the trucks; they just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House. Which is something they’ve been trying to get as you know for about 150 years, and it’s gonna be a beauty, it’ll be an absolutely magnificent structure.“And I just see all the trucks, they just started, so it’ll get done uh very nicely and it’ll be one of the best anywhere in the world, actually,” he added.Many observers noted that Trump focused on the ballroom rather than Kirk’s death.One person commented, “They are scrambling to change the subject now that the shooter was revealed to be a clean cut white kid from a conservative Mormon military and cop family.”Democratic influencer Joanne Carducci added, “I vehemently disagreed with every single thing Charlie Kirk ever said, and I was able to express more empathy than this.”Trump first announced plans for the new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which can seat 650 people, in July. The project is part of his broader plan to transform the White House with a style he has compared to his Mar-a-Lago resort.","US President Donald Trump gave an unexpected response when asked about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

A young white man from a conservative gun-loving Utah family was arrested on Friday on charges of assassinating right-wing icon Charlie Kirk, as Americans wrangled over his beliefs and what triggered him to undertake the killing.Authorities in Utah said Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody after he allegedly confessed to the shooting to a family member, who in turn told a family friend who then contacted local officials.News of the arrest was first broadcast to the world by President Trump, who aired it on Fox News even before local authorities announced it.Evidence gathered by local authorities from the scene of the shooting at the Utah Valley University campus presented a confusing picture about the background and motive of the young man, with several spent and unfired bullet casings inscribed with phrases such as “notices bulges,” “hey fascist!” “bella ciao” and ""If you read this, you are gay.”Utah governor Spencer Cox revealed at a press conference that investigators who interviewed a family member stated that Robinson had become more political in recent years and at a dinner prior to the killing talked about Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU and how much he disliked him. Authorities said Robinson will face the death penalty if convicted.Activists and trolls from the left spectrum expressed relief over the fact that the alleged assassin was ""Not registered Democrat Not transgender, Not an immigrant, and had no leftist ties,” while trolling the right because he is ""from a Christian household, a straight white male, a Republican background, and born American.”Family photos on social media also suggested he grew up around guns from a young age, providing fuel to anti-gun activists who gibed that the right would now focus on his mental state rather than act on gun laws. Trolls also posted unauthenticated photos of him wearing a Trump costume on Halloween to suggest he was a MAGA follower. MAGA faithful in turn alleged he had been radicalized by the left.The bitter exchanges came even as President Trump and his staff blamed “radical left political violence” for the killing and vowed to punish critics, even before Robinson’s arrest.Accusing the “radical left” for rhetoric that he said was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, “ Trump said his administration “will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.”","Tyler Robinson, 22, allegedly confessed to the shooting to a family member, who in turn told a family friend who then contacted local officials.

Suspect’s hostility toward Kirk’s views





Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, threatened to kill himself rather than surrender after his father confronted him, law enforcement sources said.Robinson’s father recognised him in photos released by authorities Thursday and questioned him when he returned home. According to sources, Robinson admitted to being the gunman but initially refused to turn himself in.He told his father he would rather die than face arrest. His father then persuaded him to meet with their youth minister, who also serves as a US marshals service fugitive task force officer. The minister contacted a deputy, and Robinson was taken into FBI custody, reported The New York Post.Family members told investigators Robinson had spoken negatively of Kirk in recent weeks. At a family dinner, he allegedly brought up the activist’s planned appearance at UVU and criticised his views.Utah governer Spencer Cox said Robinson had become more political and increasingly hostile toward conservative figures in recent years.US President Donald Trump announced the arrest Friday during a Fox News interview, calling it a “significant breakthrough” in what he described as a “political assassination.”“With a high degree of certainty, we have him,” Trump said, noting that someone close to Robinson helped identify him and turn him in.Kirk, 31, co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot once while addressing students at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. He was rushed to a hospital and later died. The FBI and state officials said the attack was targeted, raising new concerns about political violence.Authorities said campus surveillance footage, distinctive bullet casings, and digital evidence pointed to Robinson as the suspect.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that his country was prepared for a composite dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, but added that ""Pakistan will not beg for talks. """"Pakistan is ready for a composite dialogue with India in a dignified and respectful manner on all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as per its longstanding position on the matter,"" Dar said while speaking to the media, as quoted by PTI.India has maintained that it will only hold discussions with Pakistan on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and on the issue of terrorism.The composite dialogue process between the two countries began in 2003 during the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. It included eight baskets covering all major issues between India and Pakistan.The process broke down after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and has not been revived in its full form since.Dar, who is also Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, said that during the recent conflict, Pakistan’s position was acknowledged internationally through what he described as proactive diplomacy.India conducted precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.In retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10.

KATHMANDU: Sushila Karki took over as Nepal's PM Friday, after two days of discussions and a public vote held by Gen Z group protesters, but the latter decided not to be a part of the interim dispensation.Residents of Kathmandu TOI spoke to said the development had brought a ""sense of relief"". One of them, Niraj Lama, who runs a small hotel in Thamel, said, ""It will soon usher stability. We hope for cleaner governance too.""Abiskar Chhetri, 27, said, ""We are happy a person with proven integrity like Sushila Karki will lead the nation. The earlier gang of compromised leaders under Oli had to go.""""Congratulations! We wish you success, wish the country success,"" President Ramchandra Paudel said to Karki after the small swearing-in ceremony in the presidential palace, attended by diplomats and some former leaders. Karki, in a red sari dress, smiled, but did not make any speech.Born on June 7, 1952 in Shankarpur town of Biratnagar metropolitan city, Karki completed her BA from Mahendra Morang College in Biratnagar at the age of 20, heading to BHU after that to complete a master's in political science in 1975. She returned to Nepal thereafter to study law at Tribhuvan University in 1978.Karki started her career in 1979 before earning title of senior advocate in 2004.She went on to head Nepal's highest court, becoming first female chief justice of the country before retiring in June 2017. During her tenure, she was seen as a no-nonsense judge with ""zero tolerance towards corruption"". It was this, many said, endeared her to Gen Z protesters.Her time as Nepal's chief justice was, however, marred somewhat when the then govt led by Sher Bahadur Deuba moved an impeachment motion against her. It led to public anger, eventually forcing state to recall the motion. Karki is married to senior Nepal Congress leader Durga Subedi.","Sushila Karki took over as Nepal's PM Friday, after two days of discussions and a public vote held by Gen Z group protesters.

Kathmandu: They came with portraits clutched to their chests, tears on their faces, and hearts shattered by a tragedy that both enraged and numbed a nation. On Friday, families of young protesters killed in police firing during the Gen Z protests stood united at the Reporters' Club in Kathmandu, demanding justice and recognition for their loved ones.Sumitra Mahat, elder sister of 21-year-old Umesh Mahat, a college student, told TOI her brother dreamt of becoming a football star for Nepal. ""But like many young people, he too joined the protest to fight against the unending corruption, poverty and unemployment that's eating up the country. My parents had big hopes for him, but everything lies shattered now."" Struggling to hold her tears back, Sumitra added, ""The young souls who died that day made the supreme sacrifice for Nepal's betterment. They are martyrs, and govt should recognise them as such. Their families must also be supported so they don't face further hardship after this irreparable loss.""Among the dead was 19-year-old Rasik Khatiwada, who was hit by bullets in the chest and stomach. His aunt, Sneha, holding his portrait, said, ""It is tragic young blood is spilt because of the corruption of politicians. We ask the new govt to punish those responsible, including former PM KP Sharma Oli, in the strictest possible way.Our son is a martyr. We want a country where everyone is treated equally, without bias.""Also present was Ashish Khatri, 29, who flew in from the UK to stand with the bereaved families. ""It is unfortunate that this is the price one pays for raising a democratic voice against systemic corruption,"" he said.""People were fed up with leaders filling their pockets while ignoring the country's development. Gen Z protested for the right reasons, but the govt's response turned it into an unforgettable tragedy. Together, we will now build a better Nepal.""","Families of young protesters killed in police firing demand justice and recognition for their loved ones.

An attempt to ban social media in Nepal ended this week in violent protest with the prime minister ousted, the parliament in flames and soldiers on the streets of the capital.Now, the very technology the govt tried to outlaw was harnessed to help select the country's next leader, as more than 100,000 citizens met regularly in a virtual chat room to debate the country's future. After govt's collapse on Tuesday, the military imposed a curfew across Kathmandu, and restricted large gatherings. With the country in political limbo, Nepalese youth took to Discord, a platform popularised by video gamers, to enact the digital version of a national convention. ""Parliament of Nepal now is Discord,"" said Sid Ghimiri, 23, a content creator from Kathmandu, describing how the site became the centre of the nation's political decision-making.The conversation inside the Discord channel, taking place in a combination of voice, video, and text chats, was so consequential that it was discussed on national television and livestreamed on news sites. The channel's organisers were members of Hami Nepal, a civic organisation, and many of those participating in the chat were the so-called Gen-Z activists who led this week's protests. The army's chiefs had also met with the channel's organisers and asked them to put forth a potential nominee for interim leader.By the end of Wednesday, they said, after lengthy discussions and several polls, the Discord group had coalesced around Sushila Karki, and proposed her name for in-person meetings with the country's army. nyt","More than 100,000 citizens met regularly in a virtual chat room to debate the country's future.

Sushila Karki Sworn In as Nepal’s Interim Prime Minister

Who is Sushila Karki?



Who is Shushila Karki





NEW DELHI: Sushila Karki on Friday took the oath as Nepal's interim Prime Minister and is set to lead the government, days after the neighbouring nation witnessed massive violent protests against the KP Sharma Oli dispensation.Nepal's president Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office of secrecy to Karki at a ceremony at Sheetal Niwas, which is the President’s Office.The government has been mandated to hold elections within six months.

Karki, an alumna of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in India, was among four candidates before being finally selected following consultations involving President Poudel, Army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel, and representatives of the youth demonstrators, dubbed “Gen Z.”Also in the running were former Nepal Electricity Authority chief Kulman Ghising, Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, and Dharan mayor Harka Sampang.The ""Gen Z"" protests, initially sparked by a controversial social media ban, escalated into a broader rejection of corruption, nepotism and entrenched political elites. Soldiers remain deployed across Kathmandu after demonstrators torched government buildings, politicians’ residences and the parliament.Sushila Karki made history in July 2016 when she became Nepal’s first female chief justice. Her tenure, however, ended less than a year later after lawmakers filed an impeachment motion accusing her of “delivering biased verdicts” and ""interfering"" in executive jurisdiction.The move followed a Nepal Supreme Court ruling that struck down the government’s decision on police chief appointments, saying seniority had been unfairly bypassed.Although automatically suspended while the probe was pending, the impeachment failed to secure the two-thirds majority required before her retirement in June 2017.Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, the ex-jurist studied political science at BHU in 1975 and law at Tribhuvan University in 1978. Before becoming chief justice, she served as a Supreme Court justice, senior advocate and law professor. She is also an author on gender equality and has long been involved in human rights and women’s judicial organisations.Karki has been recognised with awards including the Sambhav Kanoon Puraskar (2004).","Nepal's president Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office of secrecy to Karki.

How Chucarosaurus reveals the secrets of titanosaur mobility and strength



Chucarosaurus diripienda highlights the scale and resilience of titanosaurs

When most people think of fossils, they imagine delicate bones carefully uncovered with brushes and small tools. However, a recent discovery in Patagonia, Argentina, challenged that perception. In the Río Negro province, paleontologists unearthed the remains of a colossal dinosaur, a newly identified titanosaur so massive that its fossilised bones actually cracked the road during transport. Named Chucarosaurus diripienda, this extraordinary dinosaur measured roughly 30 metres long and weighed tens of tonnes, making it one of the largest land animals ever discovered. Beyond its sheer size, the find is reshaping scientists’ understanding of how these long-necked giants evolved, moved, and survived in prehistoric ecosystems, offering fresh insights into their anatomy, growth patterns, and ancient environmental adaptations.The story began in 2018, when a research team exploring the rugged Patagonian terrain uncovered a series of immense fossilised bones belonging to an enormous herbivore from the Late Cretaceous period. Measuring roughly 30 metres (100 feet) in length and weighing an estimated 30 to 40 tonnes, Chucarosaurus diripienda would have been one of the largest land animals to ever walk the Earth. According to a study published in the journal Cretaceous Research , this new giant titanosaur from Argentina marks a significant addition to our understanding of these colossal creatures.As the bones were painstakingly excavated and transported to Buenos Aires for further study, their sheer mass caused an unexpected twist: the truck carrying them destabilised, and the immense weight fractured the asphalt beneath it. While the fossils remained intact and no one was injured, the incident left scientists and locals alike in awe of just how massive this creature must have been in life.Every dinosaur’s name tells a story, and Chucarosaurus diripienda’s is no exception. The genus name “Chucaro” comes from the Quechua word for “wild” or “indomitable,” while “diripienda” is Latin for “scrambled” or “scattered,” a nod to the bones that were thrown about during the transport accident. Together, the name symbolises both the immense power of the animal and the turbulent journey its fossils endured millions of years later, offering a poetic glimpse into the challenges of palaeontological discovery and the resilience of Earth’s prehistoric giants.Though Chucarosaurus doesn’t dethrone record-holders like Argentinosaurus or Patagotitan, it still ranks among the most imposing titanosaurs ever found. One of its femurs measures 1.9 metres (6.2 feet) long, an astonishing size that offers clues about the dinosaur’s physical capabilities. Interestingly, its bones show a combination of strength and slenderness not typical of other colossal sauropods, suggesting it may have been more agile than its relatives.This balance of size and mobility paints a picture of a dinosaur built not only for support but for efficient movement. With its elongated neck, Chucarosaurus could browse the highest treetops, while its massive tail may have served as both a counterbalance and a defensive weapon against predators.The discovery adds a valuable chapter to the evolutionary story of titanosaurs, the group of long-necked, plant-eating dinosaurs that dominated South America in the Cretaceous era. By comparing Chucarosaurus’s bone structure with that of other species, researchers can trace how these giants adapted to different environments, from dry plains to lush forests, developing unique limb proportions, joint structures, and movement patterns.The fossils also reveal how titanosaurs distributed their immense body weight and how their skeletons evolved to support such size without collapsing under pressure. These insights could help explain how sauropods became some of the most successful animals in Earth’s history, thriving across continents for over 100 million years.Chucarosaurus diripienda stands as more than just another fossil find; it’s a reminder of the sheer scale of prehistoric life and the challenges scientists face in unearthing it. From the dramatic discovery site in Patagonia to the cracked roads of Buenos Aires, this dinosaur’s journey mirrors its ancient story: powerful, resilient, and unforgettable. Its massive size and unique skeletal features provide crucial insights into sauropod evolution and how these colossal creatures adapted to changing environments.As research continues, this “indomitable giant” may yet reveal even more secrets about the age of giants, when the Earth rumbled beneath the weight of creatures that truly defied imagination and reshaped ecosystems millions of years ago.","Study reveals Chucarosaurus diripienda, a dinosaur 30 metres long and weighing tens of tonnes.

Scientists discover a new pink Sea Anemone that builds and expands shells for hermit crabs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/scientists-discover-a-new-pink-sea-anemone-that-builds-and-expands-shells-for-hermit-crabs/articleshow/125206736.cms,"Source: Royal Society Open Science

Two-way benefit: Sea Anemone feeds on crab waste while offering extra protection





A closer look at Paracalliactis tsukisome

Engineering precision in the deep sea





How a deep-sea partnership sheds light on the evolution of mutualism

Beneath the waves off Japan’s Pacific coast, scientists have made a discovery that seems straight out of a nature documentary: a pale pink sea anemone that actually builds homes for hermit crabs. Named Paracalliactis tsukisome, this elegant creature isn’t just another deep-sea oddity; it’s a living architect of the ocean floor. Found hundreds of metres below the surface, it forms an extraordinary partnership with hermit crabs, crafting shell-like structures that grow with their hosts. This surprising alliance challenges what we thought we knew about marine life, showing that even the simplest organisms can display astonishingly complex and purposeful behaviour in the dark depths of the sea.The relationship between Paracalliactis tsukisome and its hermit crab companion is an example of mutualism, where both species benefit from each other. The sea anemone secretes a carcinoecium, a hard, shell-like covering that reinforces and expands the crab’s housing. This unique structure grows as the crab grows, eliminating the need for the crustacean to constantly find new snail shells.In return, the anemone gains stability and mobility on the dark, food-limited seafloor.This relationship demonstrates an intricate balance of cooperation and shared benefit, a hallmark of ecological efficiency in extreme habitats.The research team, led by Associate Professor Akihiro Yoshikawa from Kumamoto University’s Aitsu Marine Station, has long studied deep-sea symbioses and shell-forming anemones. According to Yoshikawa, this discovery shows that “even simple animals like sea anemones can evolve surprisingly sophisticated behaviours.”To better understand the partnership, scientists used micro-CT scanning, a 3D imaging technique that reveals internal structures without cutting. The scans showed that Paracalliactis tsukisome consistently anchors itself near the shell opening. This precise placement allows the anemone to direct food toward itself and secrete new material in a single direction, a key trait in the spiral shell-building process.Stable isotope analysis, which tracks how different atoms move through food webs, revealed that the anemones and crabs share similar diets. The anemones had slightly higher nitrogen levels, suggesting they feed on a mix of crab waste and drifting particles. This supports a two-way exchange of resources rather than a parasitic relationship.Interestingly, hermit crabs living with Paracalliactis tsukisome grew larger than related species without such anemone partners. A stronger, custom-built shell likely provides extra protection, reducing the need for frequent shell swaps, an energy-intensive and risky task in deep waters.The research team compared tentacle counts, internal muscle arrangements, and stinging capsule types to confirm the anemone’s identity. They also analysed five genes, building evolutionary trees to determine their distinct position within the sea anemone family.Both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA confirmed that Paracalliactis tsukisome is a new species, separate from its closest relatives. To ensure scientific transparency, the researchers deposited specimens and genetic data in public collections for future verification.The species name “tsukisome” comes from a classical Japanese word for pale pink dye, a poetic nod to the creature’s delicate colour and enduring partnership with its crab companion.Unlike most sea anemones that attach randomly, Paracalliactis tsukisome grows its hard extension with directional accuracy. It secretes smooth material around the shell’s opening, keeping the entrance clear for the hermit crab. This controlled growth shows a surprising level of structural awareness in an organism without a central nervous system.The anemone’s precision suggests it can sense orientation and position, an ability previously thought to be limited to more complex animals. Future laboratory studies may explore how water flow and food availability influence its shell-building behaviour. The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science , not only introduces a new species but also highlights the intricate biological and behavioural adaptations that support survival in extreme environments.By combining micro-CT imaging, isotope analysis, and genetic sequencing, the researchers built a complete picture of how Paracalliactis tsukisome and its crab partner cooperate. The findings also offer insights into how mutualistic relationships evolve, and how marine life innovates under pressure.As deep-sea exploration continues, discoveries like this remind us how much remains unknown beneath the ocean’s surface. The delicate bond between Paracalliactis tsukisome and its hermit crab companion is not just a testament to survival but also a story of remarkable biological ingenuity.","Paracalliactis tsukisome is a new species of sea anemone found off Japan's Pacific coast.

Why can’t we see it with the naked eye?

Where did 3I/ATLAS come from?

Could it be artificial, as some scientists once speculated?

When will we get new data about it?

Astronomers and space enthusiasts across the world are gearing up for an extraordinary celestial encounter as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes its reappearance in the eastern sky before dawn on 11 November 2025, as reported by EarthSky.com. This rare interstellar visitor, which has captivated scientists and the public alike with its mysterious origins, recently completed its closest approach to the Sun or perihelion on 30 October, passing within 130 million miles (1.36 astronomical units) of our star.Experts from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are tracking its trajectory closely using advanced space instruments and live observation missions, hoping to uncover more about this fascinating traveller from beyond our solar system.Currently, 3I/ATLAS is positioned behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective, hidden from view due to the intense solar glare. However, astronomers predict that the comet will reappear in the eastern pre-dawn sky on 11 November 2025.Viewing conditions will be challenging, as reported, the comet will not be visible to the naked eye. Astronomers recommend using a large telescope of at least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter to glimpse this faint interstellar visitor.The comet is expected to appear low on the horizon before sunrise, near the constellation Sagittarius, in the same direction from which it entered our solar system.For those unable to view the event directly, live tracking and streaming are available through NASA, ESA, and several university-led observatories. Real-time sky maps and high-resolution imaging feeds are helping enthusiasts follow 3I/ATLAS as it continues its cosmic passage.Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.NASA scientists have confirmed that the comet follows a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Once it departs, it will continue its eternal journey into deep space, never to return, making this a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event for observers.At the time of its discovery, the comet was travelling at around 130,000 mph, accelerating to nearly 152,000 mph as it approached the Sun. ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft currently has one of the best vantage points for monitoring the comet as it becomes more active. Preliminary data from JUICE’s instruments are expected to arrive by February 2026, providing valuable insights into the comet’s structure and composition.As 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun, NASA’s Planetary Science Division observed that its frozen gases began to sublimate turning directly from solid to gas and releasing clouds of dust and ice. This activity created a faint, shimmering tail, which continues to change as the comet moves away from the Sun.The European Space Agency has deployed instruments aboard the JUICE spacecraft including spectrometers, cameras, and particle sensors to analyse these ejected materials. Early results suggest the comet is composed primarily of frozen water, carbon compounds, and dust, similar to comets native to our solar system. However, scientists have not ruled out the presence of more exotic materials formed in distant interstellar environments.The origins of 3I/ATLAS remain an area of active research. It is believed to have originated from a star system beyond the Milky Way’s central region, possibly ejected billions of years ago. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who previously proposed unconventional ideas about interstellar objects, suggested an artificial origin in early analyses. He has since clarified that 3I/ATLAS is “most likely natural”, though he acknowledges that alternative explanations cannot be completely dismissed.The comet will appear low in the eastern sky about an hour before sunrise, near the constellation Sagittarius.Go somewhere away from city lights to get a clearer view of the faint comet.3I/ATLAS will not be visible to the naked eye. You’ll need a telescope with at least an 8-inch (20 cm) aperture to spot it.3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, after ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Unlike typical comets, it originated beyond our solar system, likely from a distant star system.Despite being an interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS is too faint and distant for naked-eye viewing. Its brightness is limited due to its small size and the vast distance from Earth. Specialized telescopes are required to detect it.Astronomers believe it may have been ejected from a stellar nursery or planetary system near the Milky Way’s core billions of years ago. It has been traveling through interstellar space ever since.Early theories by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb proposed that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could be artificial. However, based on recent observations, he and other experts now agree it is most likely a natural comet, though its origin remains a subject of study.The European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft is monitoring 3I/ATLAS from an advantageous position near Jupiter. Early scientific data about its structure and composition is expected by February 2026.","Astronomers predict that 3I/ATLAS will reappear in the eastern pre-dawn sky on 11 November 2025.

‘She was struggling to breathe’: Federal agents pepper-spray 1-year-old girl in Chicago’s Little Village — video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/she-was-struggling-to-breathe-federal-agents-pepper-spray-1-year-old-girl-in-chicagos-little-village-video/articleshow/125211719.cms,"DHS denies allegations



DHS releases full statement: What it reads







US Border Patrol agents pepper-sprayed Rafael Veraza and his one-year-old daughter Arianna in the Sam’s Club parking lot in Cicero, just outside Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, during Operation Midway Blitz on Saturday morning.During the Saturday clash between federal officers and people in Little Village, days after a federal judge tightened rules on how immigration enforcement agents may use force under a preliminary injunction now being appealed by the Department of Justice, ABC news reported.The Department of Homeland Security said its agents had entered the parking lot after facing gunfire and other attacks.The viral video captured the moment Veraza said he and his family were sprayed. “He started spraying from the front of the car towards the back. Basically I got sprayed all over my face,” Veraza said.Veraza, who has had asthma since childhood, said the effects were immediate. “I’m asthmatic. I’ve been with asthma since I was a little kid. So the moment that it hit me, I couldn’t breathe.” He added that his daughter, who was riding in the back of the car, also inhaled the gas and both were briefly hospitalised.“My daughter was trying to open her eyes. She was struggling to breathe.”The US Department of Homeland security is once again justifying their actions. On Sunday, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on social media: “No. There was no crowd control or pepper spray deployed in a Sam’s Club parking lot. Though, over the weekend in Chicago, law enforcement was shot at, bricks thrown at them, they were rammed with vehicles and other attacks...”Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents had entered the parking lot shortly after deploying crowd-control measures on residents of Little Village. It said the actions followed gunshots fired from a black Jeep Wrangler “aimed directly at them”. “Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol’s vehicle,” a DHS statement read in part. “After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window. ”The department released images showing damage to its vehicles but offered no explanation for why Veraza and his family, who had abandoned their shopping trip after seeing the agents’ presence, were pepper-sprayed. “I’m not even doing a thing,” Veraza said. “I’m trying to exit.”In its statement, Homeland Security continued to label protesters as “rioters”, noting that Border Patrol arrested nine people on Saturday, eight of them U.S. citizens. It remains unclear whether charges have been filed.In response to the crackdown, the Indivisible Chicago Alliance held its second Chicagoland day of action on Sunday. The group gathered in West Town to assemble ICE watch packets containing whistles, buttons and informational pamphlets, and hosted sessions on knowing one’s rights.“Yesterday around 9:30 AM, in the Chicago neighbourhood of Little Village, U.S. Border Patrol was attacked while conducting immigration enforcement operations. Border Patrol was accosted by a hostile crowd that boxed them into a street and alleyway. As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds. He immediately fled the scene.“Attackers then began throwing bricks and even paint cans from a roof, damaging Border Patrol vehicles. Chicago Police Department successfully helped law enforcement evacuate the area as more bricks were thrown at the law enforcements’ vehicle. Fortunately, no Border Patrol agents were injured in this attack.“After clearing the scene of the first attack, Border Patrol then encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy at the intersection of Cermak and California, but was thwarted when a Controlled Tire Deflation Device was deployed. The Border Patrol convoy then proceeded toward an FBI facility and encountered two drivers trying to impede operations. After they were warned to stop, one of the drivers attempted to ram the convoy. The driver was arrested. Border Patrol reached the FBI facility when rioters attempted to breach security there. Chicago Police responded to help secure the perimeter.“Border Patrol then left the FBI facility and then encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski. As the rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects, Border Patrol deployed crowd control measures, cleared the area, and proceeded to a Sam’s Club parking lot. Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol’s vehicle. Three suspects were immediately arrested for assault.“After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window. The convoy became stuck at 26th and Kostner and sustained window damage along with a fourth vehicle ramming. The subject fled the scene and Border Patrol pursued. This driver remains at large.“As a result of yesterday’s multiple attacks-fuelled by sanctuary politicians and the media-Border Patrol arrested 8 U.S. citizens and one illegal alien. Thankfully, no Border Patrol agents were injured during these multiple attacks.“‘JB Pritzker and Brandon Johnson have fuelled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement,’ said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ‘In less than three hours in Chicago, Border Patrol faced gunshots, violent mobs at every stop, bricks and other objects thrown at them, and four vehicle rammings. The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented-These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media. Just last week, Chicago and national media falsely accused law enforcement of raiding a daycare centre. Now, they are silent when our agents come under gunfire.“‘Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence. To any Antifa terrorist in Chicago: You will not stop us. You will not slow us down. And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.’”President Donald Trump ordered in September to designate a decentralised movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation. Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organisation but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.","US Border Patrol agents pepper-sprayed Rafael Veraza and his one-year-old daughter Arianna in the Sam’s Club parking lot in Cicero, just outside Chicago.

NYC Mayoral: U.S. Democrat's SHOCK PREDICTION After Zohran Mamdani's Stunning Victory





New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani caught the attention of the public, especially Indians, for not just winning the polls but also for an recent video of his. The clip surfaced online just before the US city mayoral elections, showing him casually munching on Rajnigandha silver pearls during a street chat.The short video, recorded by Brooklyn-based content creator Nicolas Nuvan, shows Mamdani stepping out of a black SUV and being asked if he has eaten. “I did eat today,” he replies with a smile, before pulling out a pack of Rajnigandha — a saffron-blended cardamom seed mouth freshener widely popular in India — and adding, “I’ve also started having a lot of these… it’s like a mint.”He then offers some to Nuvan, who tastes it and exclaims, “Oh wow, that’s delicious… it feels like I’m consuming perfume.” Without missing a beat, Mamdani responds, “Perfume you can eat.”The light-hearted exchange has since gone viral and widely shared amid Mamdani’s election, with Indian users flooding the comments section with memes and quips. “No way he just ate Rajnigandha — South Asians will relate,” wrote one user while another, with play on the brand's tagline, replied, “munh mai rajnigandha, kadmon Mei NYC”.

SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday. Order follows challenge by cities and non-profit organisations.

Appointed as Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025, Handa played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw Mamdani defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens became the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, winning more than 50% of the vote in a contest that drew record participation. According to official figures, over two million New Yorkers cast ballots, nearly double the turnout from four years ago and the highest in more than five decades. Mamdani maintained a lead of around nine percentage points over Cuomo, who finished with just over 40%, while Sliwa trailed slightly above 7%. Voter engagement surged across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, reaching near presidential-election levels.Handa, a seasoned political strategist with deep roots in progressive organising, turned Mamdani’s underdog campaign into a citywide force that cut across class and community lines. Working largely behind the scenes, she used her sharp political instincts to refine and amplify Mamdani’s message, one centred on economic fairness, affordable living, and social justice, ensuring it reached and resonated with New Yorkers from every borough.Maya Handa’s rise as a political strategist culminated in her appointment as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager for his historic bid to become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. A seasoned political organiser with a deep commitment to progressive causes, Handa’s background has made her an invaluable asset in Mamdani’s pursuit of the mayoralty.Appointed to lead the campaign in July 2025, Handa replaced Elle Bisgaard-Church, who had served as Mamdani’s chief of staff and led his primary campaign. Her appointment marked a decisive shift in the campaign’s leadership structure. As Bisgaard-Church transitioned to serve as Mamdani’s chief adviser, Handa took over day-to-day campaign management, joining alongside Afua Atta-Mensah, who became political director, and Deandra Khan, director of labour and intergovernmental affairs.Handa’s résumé reads like a map of the modern progressive movement in the United States. She has worked on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Representative Mondaire Jones’ congressional run, and India Walton’s mayoral bid in Buffalo. She also managed Nida Allam’s campaign for North Carolina’s 4th congressional district and has collaborated with the influential Working Families Party, a central player in New York’s left-leaning political landscape.In addition to these national roles, Handa has worked with prominent local officials including Queens Assemblymember Claire Valdez and Brooklyn Councilmember Shahana Hanif, both noted advocates for social justice and inclusivity. Some of these roles were not formally listed on her public profile, but multiple reports, including those by The New York Times and CNN, have documented her deep involvement in community-centred politics.When Mamdani entered the mayoral race last year, few expected him to challenge, let alone defeat, political heavyweights like Cuomo and Sliwa. He had minimal name recognition, limited funding, and very little institutional party backing. Handa’s strategic arrival transformed those significant disadvantages into a disciplined, grassroots-driven strategy.Drawing on her extensive campaign experience, Handa reoriented Mamdani’s operation around ground-level outreach, emphasising neighbourhood canvassing, precise messaging, and inclusive communication. She prioritised genuine voter connection over traditional, advertising-heavy tactics, shaping a clear narrative around economic fairness, rent freezes, and affordable childcare.Her focus on authenticity rather than polish helped Mamdani build trust across the city, resonating with working-class families in Brownsville as much as with younger professionals in Manhattan.Handa also helped strengthen the campaign’s coalition. She brought in new advisers and operational leads, including Atta-Mensah, whose role focused on expanding Black voter outreach, and Mr Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who took charge of communications after the primary. Together, they built a tightly coordinated and disciplined campaign that remained true to Mamdani’s grassroots message while expanding its reach across the city. And though Mamdani was the public face of the movement, it was Handa who quietly engineered its success.","Maya Handa, 34, was appointed as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025. She played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw him defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Trump Takes One Last Jab at Pelosi, Calls Retirement “A Great Thing for the Country”

Nancy Pelosi's historic clashes with Trump









President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country'. Fox News reported Trump's reaction to Pelosi's retirement. ""She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I’m honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician,"" Trump said as reported by Fox's Peter Doocy.The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection. In a video, she said: ""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city. That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know. I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. ""“With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative. As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our Democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”There were speculations for days that Pelosi would soon announce her retirement and she was expected to leave Congress after this time, her first in decades as a rank-and-file member.Reflecting on her many roles on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Thursday: “I say to my colleagues in the House all of the time, no matter what title they had bestowed upon me – speaker, leader, whip – there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, ‘I speak for the people of San Francisco.’”In September 2019, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, citing his solicitation of foreign assistance and a betrayal of national security. The showdown entered public view in dramatic fashion in 2020 when, during Trump’s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up a copy of his speech immediately after, calling it a “manifesto of mistruths.” After January 6, 2021, Pelosi condemned Trump's role in inciting the the mob, describing his subsequent visit to the Capitol as “returning to the scene of the crime. ”","President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country' The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125137197,imgsize-906604,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-said-it39s-great-news-for-america-that-nancy-pelosi-is-retiring.jpg"
US Airport Shutdown: US losing $15bn each week; 40 airports to be closed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-crisis-deepens-us-losing-15bn-each-week-40-airports-to-be-closed/articleshow/125126785.cms,"Mayhem At US Airports: Americans Suffer As FAA Orders 10% Flight Cuts Amid Govt Shutdown | Watch

40 airports to face closures





Political stalemate continues









The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history. With no agreement between Republicans and Democrats, key services are now being disrupted and the economic impact is growing. Analysts estimate the shutdown is costing the economy about $15bn a week, as per Bloomberg.Air travel is the latest major sector to be affected. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will reduce flights across 40 busy airports from Friday because of severe staff shortages, and officials warn that delays and cancellations are likely to worsen if the shutdown continues.The congressional deadlock centres on funding for healthcare subsidies and broader government spending. Democrats insist that expiring health insurance tax credits must be renewed and cuts to Medicaid reversed before any agreement is signed. Republicans, who control both chambers but lack the Senate votes needed to pass a spending bill alone, are pushing for a short-term funding measure without concessions. Trump has refused to engage in negotiations until the government is reopened, and at the same time has threatened to permanently sack thousands of federal workers.Nearly 1.4 million federal employees are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Millions of Americans are already feeling the effects: food assistance has been disrupted, national parks shuttered, government-backed loans frozen, and key economic data suspended. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth could fall by up to two percentage points in the final quarter of the year — and that if the shutdown extends to Thanksgiving, around $14bn will never be recovered.The most alarming consequences are now being felt in US air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it will reduce flights by 10% across 40 major airports from Friday, citing severe staffing shortages. More than 400 shortages have been logged at FAA facilities since 1 October — four times higher than this time last year. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid for over a month, many forced into mandatory overtime while struggling to pay bills or even transport costs to work.“We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”Major aviation unions and airlines warn that hundreds, if not thousands, of flights could be cancelled. Bedford admitted the agency “can’t ignore” the impact of exhausted and unpaid workers, adding that even if the government reopens, normal operations cannot resume immediately. Transport Secretary Sean Duffy has issued some of the starkest warnings so far, saying controllers might miss a second full paycheque next week — a scenario he said could bring “mass chaos”, including the closure of airspace in parts of the country.During the past weekend alone, at least 39 flight control facilities reported potential staffing limits, compared to a pre-shutdown weekend average of just over eight. Travel industry leaders say confidence in America’s air system is being damaged, and the shutdown is “forcing difficult operational decisions” that could ripple across the global aviation network.Despite the mounting crisis, progress in Congress is limited. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims his “gut” suggests a breakthrough may be near, but Democrats and Republicans remain entrenched. Some moderates in both parties want a deal before Thanksgiving, though repeated Senate votes on a short-term funding plan have failed 14 times.The White House has adopted a more aggressive posture than in previous shutdowns. Trump has not only refused to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but has openly sought to permanently fire “non-essential” employees. A federal judge blocked the attempt to lay off around 4,000 workers, but the administration is appealing. “Back pay depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump told reporters. “Some workers don’t deserve to be taken care of. ”Essential services such as border control, hospital care and mail delivery continue, but many others are paralysed. National monuments are shut, government-backed loans stalled, and the suspension of economic reports has fuelled uncertainty among markets and policymakers.During the last shutdown in 2018–19, widespread flight disruptions finally forced an end to the blockade. Analysts warn history could repeat itself — but with air travel already at a breaking point and billions in economic losses mounting, the cost of political stalemate is rising fast. Whether Congress can reach a compromise, and whether the White House will sign it, remains the central unanswered question as the shutdown grinds toward a second month.","The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history.

A historical struggle for independence



Modern observance and Royal Decree





Article I: Amended Royal Decree 88/2022 to state, “National Day of the Sultanate of Oman: 20 and 21 November.”

Article II: The decree was to be published in the Official Gazette and became effective on issuance.

National Day celebrations





Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with vibrant patriotic and cultural events:• Students proudly sing the national anthem, Salâm as-Solṭâni, during school ceremonies.• Public festivities include lively parades, fireworks, camel races, equestrian shows, and a colourful marine festival.• Once every five years, a grand military show is added to the celebrations.• Cities and towns across Oman are beautifully decorated with flags and festive lights.The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in noticeably heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with strong community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day proudly serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a joyful celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese invaders centuries ago to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday nationwide, the observance deeply connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign, and enduring nation","Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country.

'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

'You Dispute, But...': Justice Alito Grills Dem Attorney On Trump Emergency Powers In Tariffs Case





DAYTON: Salman Rushdie was among the honorees Sunday at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio, receiving a lifetime achievement award after publishing his first work of fiction since being stabbed on a New York lecture stage three years ago.The prizes honour both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement.The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, ""The Satanic Verses,"" which prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding.He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant, who wasn't born when ""The Satanic Verses"" was published, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Authorities said his attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a US citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for Rushdie's death when he travelled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 110 kilometers southwest of Buffalo.Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, ""Knife,"" in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is ""The Eleventh Hour,"" which includes three novellas and two short stories.Other past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include former US President Jimmy Carter , Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, feminist movement icon Gloria Steinem and writers Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, and Studs Terkel.The lifetime achievement award, also known as the Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.Other honorees this year include Kaveh Akbar for his novel, ""Martyr!"" about a poet and son of Iranian immigrants dealing with a mysterious family past, and Sunil Amrith, for ""The Burning Earth,"" a history of how the global environment has been shaped by empires, wars and humanity's increasing freedom of movement.","Salman Rushdie is among the honorees at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio.

A man with life-threatening injuries and four juveniles with non-life-threatening injuries were rushed to hospital.Police Capt. Kevin Lee told the San Francisco Chronicle at the scene that the shooting stemmed from a fight. There were no arrests and investigators did not immediately release suspect information.“A fight broke out shortly before 9 p.m. which resulted in the shooting.

Transportation Secy accuses Schumer of 'playing politics' over shutdown



'Air travel be reduced to a trickle'







Flight disruptions climbed sharply across the US on Sunday, with cancellations and delays far exceeding normal levels amid mounting pressure on the aviation system from the ongoing government shutdown.Over 2,100 flights were cancelled on Sunday due to the shutdown and the FAA’s recent order to scale back air traffic, according to The Associated Press.The cancellations, which affected 40 US airports, were reported by the AP at 5 pm ET on Sunday, along with 7,000 additional delays. More than 1,500 flights were cancelled on Saturday, following over 1,000 cancellations on Friday.Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta recorded the most cancellations on Sunday, with 173, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, with 115. The FAA said staffing shortages at Newark and LaGuardia Airport in New York were leading to average departure delays of about 75 minutes.Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Michigan was mostly empty on Sunday morning, with minimal wait times at security checkpoints as delays and cancellations filled the departures and arrivals boards.In a social media post on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of “playing politics” over the govt shutdown and the travel-related issues that have arisen from it.In the X post, Duffy argued that the New York senator “voted 14 times to keep the government closed.”“14 times he refused to pay air traffic controllers,” Duffy’s post said. “14 times to keep Americans’ flights delayed. 14 times to use public pain as leverage. And then he says every day gets better!”Duffy also attached a video of a recent CNN clip where he explained his reasoning for reducing flights and air traffic controllers. “I have more complaints coming into the FAA from pilots who are saying that air traffic controllers are not as responsive, they seem stressed, or they’re not using the appropriate language because they’re under pressure,” the official said. “So I look at that data. That came from the safety team, and the trend line is going in the wrong direction. So I need to take action and make sure that we keep people safe.”In a November 7 X post, Schumer blamed Republicans for the shutdown and said that “the ball is in their court.” “Democrats made an offer to Republicans to re-open the government and extend the ACA tax credits for one year,” wrote Schumer. “We’re calling their bluff.”Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel across the US would worsen in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, noting that a “substantial” number of Americans may not be able to travel at all during the busy holiday.He made the remarks on CNN’s “State of the Union” as the govt shutdown hit day 40 – the longest in history.“To answer your question, it's only going to get worse,” Duffy said of air travel. “I look to the two weeks before Thanksgiving, you're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle.”When asked if there was numerical data estimating how many Americans may not be able to visit their families during the year’s busiest travel holiday, Duffy replied: “I think the number is going to be substantial,” adding that the air travel situation has “only gotten worse as we've gone through the shutdown.”Duffy said the shutdown had led to a shortage of air traffic controllers, which had directly impacted flights, and warned that the effects could last beyond the reopening of the govt. “I used to have about four controllers retire a day before the shutdown. I'm now up to 15 to 20 a day are retiring,” Duffy said. “So it's going to be harder for me to come back after the shutdown and have more controllers controlling the airspace. So this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up.”","Over 2,100 flights were cancelled on Sunday due to the shutdown and the FAA’s recent order to scale back air traffic.

'Exposing corrupt journalists': Donald Trump reacts to BBC boss Tim Davie stepping down over Jan 6 speech row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/exposing-corrupt-journalists-donald-trump-reacts-to-bbc-boss-tim-davie-stepping-down-over-jan-6-speech-row/articleshow/125209283.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Sunday responded to the resignation of Tim Davie as Director‑General of the BBC. The MAGA chief thanked The Telegraph for ""exposing corrupt journalists. ""On his social‑media platform Truth Social, he posted: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”Davie announced his departure on Sunday, effectively ending a 20‑year career at the corporation and five years in the top job. His exit comes amid a storm over a documentary broadcast by the BBC’s flagship series Panorama, which is alleged to have misled viewers by editing together different parts of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech so it appeared he encouraged a violent march to the US Capitol.In reality the sequence omitted later remarks in which Trump called for peaceful protest.An internal memo by former BBC‑standards adviser Michael Prescott accused the broadcaster of “serious and systemic” bias, including over the Trump speech, coverage of the Gaza conflict and transgender issues. It was the leak of that memo to a major British newspaper that triggered both threats of parliamentary action and intense media backlash.In his resignation message, Davie said: “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director‑general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” His departure also involved the BBC’s News chief, Deborah Turness, who announced she would step away, saying the row had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love.”Trump alleged the BBC sought to influence an American election and accused Britain’s public broadcaster of bias as a result.BBC will now work through a transition period under outgoing chair Samir Shah.","US President Donald Trump responded to the resignation of Tim Davie as Director‑General of the BBC.

In an interview with UnHerd, Nalin Haley, who has emerged as a vocal MAGA activist, said those who do not like America should just get out. Case in point is journalist Mehdi Hasan, he said. Haley said he is not sarcastic when he says Mehdi Hasan should be denaturalized and thrown out of the US.“No, I quite literally mean that. I’m often sarcastic, but not in this case. I mean, he hates America. If you hate America, you shouldn’t be in America. … Everyone wants to make it so complicated. That’s the thing with the past generation. They always talk about the rules, regulations, process. No, it’s simple. If you don’t like America, get out,"" Indian -origin Nalin Haley said.The 24-year-old regularly picks online fights and one of the latest was his criticism of Vivek Ramaswamy . Ramaswamy urged the GOP to stop identity politics and rise above race, religion -- in the aftermath of GOP's defeat in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.Nalin Haley did not agree with him, calling his explanation cringeworthy as he said the GOP cares about religion.Not only immigration, irrespective of legality, Nalin Haley believes that the US should end all foreign aid as long as people have unemployment, medical debt. “My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools. It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one. So I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school,"" Nalin Haley said.The 24-year-old works in finance but he said he can't see himself owning a house. “My parents bought their first house for $90,000. I mean, that house probably now is worth $400,000. How can we compete?”",Former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley said the US should stop legal immigration as well.

'He's flying around in a corporate jet': Vivek Ramaswamy's rival says he's not running for Governor; 'Let's be honest',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hes-flying-around-in-a-corporate-jet-vivek-ramaswamys-rival-says-hes-not-running-for-governor-lets-be-honest/articleshow/125208645.cms,"



Dr Amy Acton, the Democratic governor candidate for Ohio, said her rival Vivek Ramaswamy , is not running for the governor position. ""He's running for the presidency. Let's just be honest,"" Acton said on a podcast a few days ago, adding that Ramaswamy is hardly spending any time in Ohio. ""He's flying around in a corporate jet, from Columbus to Cincinnati. Can't go the 90 minutes on 71. And we are going around in an old Jeep,"" Acton said.This comes as MAGA has isolated Ramaswamy and is now pitching for his defeat in the Ohio election, one year away from now, only because of his Indian origin. Ramaswamy became a soft target in MAGA after he expressed his stance on H-1B and criticized American culture to explain why tech companies need high-skilled foreigners. This did not go down well with the MAGA.After socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayor election, Ramaswamy issued a warning for the Republicans and said the defeat for the GOP shows that the party must shun identity politics, rise above race, religion, color of people and focus on issues that people are facing. Ramaswamy said though Mamdani's solutions are horrendous, he raised the issue of affordability which the GOP has the best solution.Vivek's sermonizing again upset the MAGA and they raised a demand for changing the GOP candidate for Ohio unless the party wants to lose the seat. One outlier poll also projected that Amy Acton has more favorability now than Ramaswamy, though Ramaswamy has bagged major endorsements.Trump asserted that there will be no change in the candidate and Vivek Ramaswamy will remain the GOP candidate. ""I know Vivek well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He is Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our country,"" said Trump. ""As your next Governor, Vivek will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE USA, Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,"" Trump posted in a out-of-turn endorsement for Vivek.","Amy Acton, the Democratic governor candidate for Ohio, said her rival Vivek Ramaswamy is not running for the governor position.

US Shutdown Day 38: JD Vance BLASTS Judge For ‘ORDERING’ Trump To Fully Fund SNAP | ‘ABSURD’





Saturday Night Live opened its latest episode with a noisy and fast-moving sketch that showed James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump riffing through a long, off-topic monologue after a man fainted inside the Oval Office.The cold open imagined Trump holding a meeting with pharmaceutical executives to talk about lowering the prices of GLP-1 medications. The scene included Mikey Day as Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks, Andrew Dismukes as Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Marcello Hernandez as Dr Mehmet Oz. Moments into the discussion, a staffer collapsed, prompting RFK Jr to shout “Oh no!” before sprinting away.Johnson’s Trump immediately turned the medical scare into a stage for jokes. “Oh, hi. Didn’t see you there. Someone was dying in my office. I think I’m playing this very normal. Just stand there and stare like a sociopath. Didn’t even pretend like I was going to help, like when someone drops something and you do the fake bend.”Trump was slammed for ""ignoring"" a medical emergency in his office this week after he did not reach out to help a collapsing man behind him.He then mocked US health secretary RFK Jr’s reaction and his infamous comment on vaccines.“And how about RFK, huh? Booked it out of here like someone was trying to give him a vaccine. ‘Brain worm, take the wheel!’ That thing kind of Ratatouille’d him right out of the room.”The sketch also poked at the week’s political headlines. Trump complained about Democratic victories in the midterms, including the win of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. He said, “I can’t believe they elected Mamdani. We like to say ‘Mamdani!’ You know, I’m torn because I like a winner, but I’m not crazy about a Muslim. Maybe he’ll convert, right? We’ll put him in line behind ‘Ursha’ Vance. And I hope I’m pronouncing that wrong. ”SNL linked the monologue to ongoing issues in Washington. Johnson’s Trump shed a light on rising food prices, suspension of SNAP benefits and continuing government shutdown. “I promised grocery prices would plummet, and they did: they plummeted straight up. And people are now saying, ‘But sir, how will I afford my Thanksgiving turkey for my family? Well, the good news is your family is not coming because all the planes are gone. We call that problem solving problem. Killing two birds with another bird. Now you got a bunch of crazy birds.’”He added, “That’s kind of our thing. Can’t afford food? Have some cheap Ozempic. Now you’re not hungry and you get to take one weird, painful poop a week.”The skit ended with fake Trump discussing the shutdown and targeting multiple political wings. “All thanks to the Democrats and some Republicans and all Republicans and me.” He even joked about festive plans. “And while we’re at it, we’re looking into perhaps stealing Christmas. We’ll be doing Grinch. I like the Grinch; he’s a great guy. You know, our wives are friends. We play golf sometimes.”When the man who fainted was finally helped back to his feet, Johnson’s Trump offered him his “MRI punch card”. “One more, and the next one’s free!”This was a jibe at Trump getting a sudden MRI scan at 79, which his administration described as a ‘routine check-up’, even though medical experts say an abrupt MRI at that age can be a cause for concern.","Saturday Night Live opened its latest episode with a noisy and fast-moving sketch that showed Donald Trump riffing through a long, off-topic monologue.

"Federal agents detain and separate Latino father from toddler, leaving child with ‘dirty diaper, bruises and rash’; DHS justifies actions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-agents-detain-and-separate-latino-father-from-toddler-leaving-child-with-dirty-diaper-bruises-and-rash-dhs-justifies-actions/articleshow/125205371.cms,"



Democrats and immigrant rights activists are angry at federal agents after a Latino father in Los Angeles was arrested and separated from his toddler, who was later found with a dirty nappy, a bruise on her face and signs of a rash.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rejected accusations of misconduct and said that the man himself endangered the child.The incident took place in a Home Depot car park in the Cypress Park area, where US Customs and Border Protection agents carried out an operation targeting undocumented immigrants. Witnesses said officers detained 32-year-old Dennis Quiñonez while his daughter remained strapped in her car seat inside the vehicle, reports the New York Times.What shocked onlookers was what happened next. After Quiñonez was taken to another vehicle, an armed agent climbed into the driver’s seat of his Chevy hatchback, and another agent got in beside him. “There’s a baby in the back!” someone shouted. Moments later, the agents drove away with the toddler still inside.The child was later picked up by her grandmother, who told reporters she found the girl distressed and uncomfortable.MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff reported that the man who collected the child described her condition in blunt terms. “When I picked up my granddaughter from the federal agents, she had a dirty diaper, a bruise on her face, and was developing a rash. She was exhausted and cried… My heart aches knowing this could happen to others, to my kids, or even me, despite being U.S. citizens.”California Governor Gavin Newsom called the incident “sick” and demanded answers about how federal officers handled the toddler and why they transported her without any child welfare officials present.DHS officials hit back immediately. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the agency, accused Newsom of spreading misinformation and defended the officers’ actions.She posted on X: “You’re peddling lies and glorifying a man who abandoned his own child in a vehicle to go and attack federal law enforcement, wielding a hammer and throwing rocks at law enforcement,” she said. She added that a stolen pistol was found inside his car and that he had an active warrant. “Law enforcement rightly looked over the child until they were in the safe custody of a guardian.”According to a federal affidavit, Quiñonez was charged with illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition due to a previous domestic violence conviction. DHS says he approached agents holding a hammer, threw two “rock-like” objects and created a dangerous environment for his daughter.Immigrant rights groups say the case shows agents are stretching legal boundaries. They argue that transporting a toddler in a detainee’s vehicle, without notifying child welfare services, breaks long-standing procedures used by other federal and local agencies.Quiñonez was freed on bond and is due in court on December 1. His family says the toddler is recovering, though still asking for her father.","Dennis Quiñonez, 32, was arrested in a Home Depot car park in Los Angeles.

FBI director Kash Patel was reportedly alarmed when someone who reports to DNI Tulsi Gabbard examined FBI case files on the Charlie Kirk shooting. Patel and other FBI officials believed that Joe Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center was overstepping. This created a simmering tension between Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, as reported by the New York Times. But FBI sources pushed back on such claims and dismissed them as rumors.Joe Kent was reportedly looking for any information that ties Charlie Kirk's assassination to any foreign group -- like conspiracy theorist Candace Owens suggested -- or any terror groups. Kent had a meeting with Patel, who was not happy with Kent's digging, at the White House with Vice President JD Vance and DNI Tulsi Gabbard being present.The NYT report claimed that Kash Patel was troubled that Kent had gone through FBI materials regarding the case.Tyler Robinson was arrested on the charge of killing Charlie Kirk and FBI said he acted alone. The investigators produced his texts as evidence but many Conservative activists refuse to believe that Charlie Kirk's assassination was a one-man job, given Kirk's political importance.The NYT report said the tension between Patel's office and Gabbard's office was so intense that two meetings had to be held and little was achieved in the first meeting.""The FBI and the Justice Department generally keep tight control over evidence in criminal cases, particularly when they are preparing for a trial, in which government documents may have to be turned over to the defense and could be used to poke holes in the prosecution’s case,"" the NYT report said.Fox News reported that there was no feud and the report was exaggerated; both departments want justice for Charlie Kirk.Tyler Robinson, the accused of Charlie Kirk's assassination, has not pleaded guilty.

'If China Held U.S Citizen Hostage...': Justice Thomas Grills Dem Lawyer On Trump Tariff Authority





US President Donald Trump launched a strong defence of his tariff policies on Sunday, calling opponents “fools” and asserting that the measures have made the United States “the richest, most respected country in the world. ”His comments came on Truth Social as the US Supreme Court heard a crucial case earlier this week, examining whether the president overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping import duties.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are the Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion.”Claiming that tariffs had triggered a surge in domestic investment, Trump added that “businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS” and that the administration planned “a dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!).”He questioned the limits on presidential power in trade matters, stating, “So, let’s get this straight??? The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!), and LICENSE a Foreign Country, but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY.That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! The whole thing is ridiculous! Other Countries can Tariff us, but we can’t Tariff them??? It is their DREAM!!! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??? “He added, “without tariffs, we have nothing of the following.”Trump’s remarks coincided with oral arguments before the US Supreme Court, where justices across the ideological spectrum raised doubts about the administration’s justification for the tariffs.According to a BBC report, several conservative justices questioned the White House’s broad application of levies under the international emergency economic powers act (IEEPA) - a 1977 law allowing presidents to regulate trade during a national emergency.Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked pointedly, “And so is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain? France?” She noted that if the administration lost, the US government could be forced to refund billions of dollars in collected tariffs, calling the process a potential “complete mess.”The case - seen as a major test of presidential authority - challenges whether Trump’s imposition of tariffs on goods from dozens of countries, ranging from India to France, went beyond what Congress authorised. The White House has argued that the power to “regulate” trade includes the ability to impose tariffs, with solicitor general John Sauer warning that striking down the policy could invite “ruthless trade retaliation” and cause “ruinous economic and national security consequences. ”Appearing later on Fox News, Trump said he thought the hearing “went well” and described the dispute as “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”The Supreme Court’s ruling is expected to have sweeping implications for future presidents’ ability to unilaterally set trade policy.","US President Donald Trump defended his tariff policies on Sunday.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Vivek sidelined in MAGA, Trump has to endorse him



Is Vivek not American?







GOP leader and Ohio Governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy once again spoke out on self-described socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral election at a time he is at the center of a major MAGA controversy. Appearing on a Fox segment hosted by Lara Trump, Ramaswamy revealed that Mamdani's win in New York City is shocking because New York City ""used to be a great American city, embodiment of capitalism, success and ambition"". Ramaswamy said President Donald Trump has done his part, securing the border and securing international peace.Now it is the duty of the local leaders to focus on domestic economics, Ramaswamy said, adding that as bad as Mamdani's solutions are, he is still pointing towards the issue of affordability that affects a lot of Americans. Ramaswamy said it's ironic because teh Republicans have the right answer.Mamdani's win brought the focus on Vivek Ramaswamy , another Indian-origin leader on the other side of the political spectrum who asked MAGA to shun identity politics after the GOP's embarrassing defeat in New York, New Jersey and Virginia. MAGA demanded that Vivek be replaced by a full American candidate; otherwise, they would make sure that Vivek loses. MAGA claimed that it's no longer a fight between the Republicans and the Democrats but between Americans and non-Americans and Vivek must lose the Ohio election in 2026.The demand grew so loud that President Donald Trump had to issue a fresh endorsement for Vivej, calling him ""special"". ""Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country. As your next Governor, Vivek will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations..."" Trump posted to silence the murmurs against Vivek only because he has Indian origin.Vivek Ramaswamy was born in Ohio to Indian-origin parents, making him a US citizen by birth.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week. It seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary. The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan's longest-serving de facto head of state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125203879,imgsize-651535,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-42.jpg"

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces. The ceremony also included a splendid flypast of JF-17 Thunder jets.","Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.

NEW DELHI: The third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended on Saturday without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism, with both sides trading blame for the collapse of negotiations.Afghanistan’s Taliban government accused Pakistan of adopting an “irresponsible and uncooperative” stance during the two-day talks held in Istanbul under the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye.“During the discussions, the Pakistani side attempted to shift all responsibility for its security to the Afghan government, while showing no willingness to take responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own,” Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on social media.The negotiations, aimed at addressing Pakistan’s concerns over attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from Afghan territory, failed to produce a breakthrough after Kabul refused to give a written commitment to act against the group, according to Pakistani officials.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the talks had been suspended indefinitely. “There is a complete deadlock. The negotiations have entered an indefinite phase,” Asif told a private TV channel, adding that “there is no programme for the fourth round of talks.”Asif thanked Qatar and Turkiye for their mediation efforts but said even the facilitators had lost optimism. “They support our stance. Even the Afghan delegation agreed with us; however, they were not ready to sign a written agreement. They wanted verbal assurances to be accepted, which is not possible in international negotiations,” he said.He reiterated that Pakistan would only recognise a formal, written accord. “If there is any attack from Afghan soil, we will respond accordingly. As long as there is no aggression, the ceasefire will remain intact,” Asif said.The breakdown in talks marks another setback for efforts to ease tensions between the two neighbours, who have seen repeated border clashes and escalating mistrust since early October.Mediation efforts falter amid renewed border tensionsThe breakdown came as tensions flared along the border, with both sides accusing each other of overnight shelling that left four Afghan civilians dead and several others wounded. Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the stalemate, saying that “the onus lies on the Afghan Taliban to fulfil its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism, in which so far they have failed. ”“Pakistan does not harbour any ill-will against the Afghan people. However, it shall never support the Afghan Taliban regime’s any measures that are detrimental to the interests of the Afghan people as well as the neighbouring countries,” Tarar wrote on X, stressing that Islamabad will “continue to safeguard its citizens and sovereignty.”The talks were the latest in a series of mediation efforts since October, when cross-border fighting between Afghan and Pakistani forces left dozens dead on both sides. A Qatar-brokered ceasefire on October 19 has largely held, though sporadic clashes have continued.Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of harbouring TTP militants responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, a claim Kabul denies. Afghan officials, in turn, accuse Islamabad of initiating the latest round of border clashes.The Afghan side, led by intelligence chief Abdul Haq Wasiq, and Pakistan’s delegation, headed by Lt. Gen. Asim Malik, had met in Istanbul to salvage the truce, but the discussions yielded no progress.Tensions between the two neighbours have escalated since early October, following explosions in Kabul and Paktika that Afghanistan blamed on Pakistan. Both sides have since exchanged artillery fire and traded accusations of harbouring militants.In recent months, Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks claimed by the TTP, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States. The TTP, though separate, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban, with many of its leaders believed to be operating from within Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021.With the latest round of peace talks collapsing, both nations now face renewed uncertainty over how to prevent further cross-border violence, despite international mediation and repeated calls for restraint.",Third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ends without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism.

'A shame': Barlow on Indira Gandhi not approving joint India-Israel strike on Pakistan's nuclear facility





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s initial motive for developing nuclear weapons — to counter India — gradually evolved into an effort to create an “Islamic bomb” aimed at aiding other Muslim nations, including Iran, according to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Richard Barlow.Barlow, who served as a counter-proliferation officer during the 1980s when Islamabad was covertly advancing its nuclear programme, attributed this shift in intent to Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistan’s atomic weapons project.“Pakistan’s primary motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India. But it was also very clear from AQ Khan and the generals’ perspective that it was not just the Pakistani bomb; it was the Islamic bomb — the Muslim bomb,” Barlow told news agency ANI.“I think AQ Khan was even quoted once as saying, ‘We’ve got the Christian bomb, the Jewish bomb, and the Hindu bomb; we need a Muslim bomb.’ It was very clear to me that Pakistan intended to provide nuclear weapons technology to other Muslim countries — which is what happened,” he added.However, the phrase “Muslim bomb” did not originate with Khan but with then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated Pakistan’s nuclear programme and placed Khan at its helm.Meanwhile, Barlow also alleged that Washington’s response to Islamabad’s secret nuclear dealings was marked by “negligence.”“Not only did they (the United States) shut down from doing anything about that in 1987 and 1988, but they did nothing for the next 20 to 24 years,” he remarked.Today, only nine countries possess nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea — the number of weapons in that order.While India adheres to a No First Use (NFU) policy, pledging not to use nuclear weapons unless attacked first, Pakistan imposes no such restriction on itself.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May, was on the verge of turning nuclear, but that his “intervention” prevented an escalation and led to a ceasefire.Barlow also claimed that a proposal by Israel to jointly bomb with India, Pakistan's Kahuta nuclear facility in the early 1980s could have ""solved a lot of problems.""The disapproval by the Indira Gandhi government was a ""shame,"" he said.""I was out of government from 1982 until 1985. And I think that may have occurred while I was out of government. I heard about it at some point. But I didn't get my teeth into it because it never happened. It's a shame that Indira Gandhi didn't approve it; it would have solved a lot of problems,"" he stated.According to reports and declassified accounts, Israel and India had planned a pre-emptive airstrike on Pakistan's Kahuta uranium enrichment plant -- the core of its nuclear programme -- to prevent Islamabad from developing and proliferating nuclear weapons, particularly to Iran, which is regarded as a ""grave adversary"" by Israel .Barlow suggested that the US administration at the time, under then-President Ronald Reagan, would have strongly opposed any such strike, particularly from Israel, as it could have disrupted America's covert war effort against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.","Former CIA counter-proliferation officer Richard Barlow says Pakistan's initial motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India.

Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's duplicity on terrorism was laid bare once again after a minister in prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government paid a visit to the political wing of Hafiz Saeed ’s banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), the outfit responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior and a close aide of Shehbaz Sharif, visited the Faisalabad office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), widely recognised as the political front of Hafiz Saeed's JuD, and held meetings with its leaders on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The visit, described locally as an attempt to ""build political consensus,"" has sparked outrage for what appears to be official patronage of a proscribed terror-linked organisation.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is currently serving time in Lahore jail after multiple convictions in terror-financing cases.In a statement released after the visit, the PMML said Chaudhry and party leaders discussed ""national unity"" and ""political stability,"" underscoring the importance of ""continuity of democratic processes."" The meeting, held under the guise of promoting harmony, effectively showcased how Pakistan’s political establishment continues to normalise banned extremist outfits.This marks the first visit by a federal minister to the PMML office in recent years, further blurring the line between Pakistan's political class and its radical organisations. Earlier, Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had attended a PMML rally in Kasur, where he openly praised Saeed, another indication of how terror-linked figures are courted by the ruling elite.Observers say the timing is significant. The PMML’s resurgence has coincided with renewed tensions with India, especially after the Pahalgam terror attack, with the group reportedly operating freely ""under government umbrella.""","Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior, visited the office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) The PMML is the political wing of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

The incident followed Taliban claims that Pakistan had carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, an accusation Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.Islamabad has consistently urged the Taliban to prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban firmly reject.","Pakistan fired into Afghanistan, breaking the ceasefire, as officials are in Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.

Ceasefire talks continue amid mistrust





Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul, but was unable to implement any of them because Islamabad had not authorised him to make final decisions. Speaking in parliament, and quoted by TOLOnews, Dar said his visit to Afghanistan had been positive but ultimately meaningless due to the Pakistani government’s restrictions on his authority.Dar told lawmakers: “The meetings were very positive; I was warmly received. I didn’t leave the work unfinished there. I know our system does not allow me to make decisions. I wanted to return and implement all that was agreed upon, but the system doesn’t allow it.”His admission highlights growing institutional disarray in Islamabad as the government struggles to manage one of Pakistan’s most volatile diplomatic relationships. It also comes at a time when Pakistan and the Taliban are holding fresh talks to prevent a return to deadly border clashes.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif confirmed on Wednesday that a delegation had left for Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.Asif told reporters the delegation would begin negotiations on Thursday, saying: “Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.” He added that Pakistan’s demand remained unchanged — that Afghanistan “clamp down on attacks originating from its soil”.According to Dawn, the latest meetings follow days of heavy border hostilities and previously failed negotiations. A fragile ceasefire is currently in place and both sides agreed to three basic principles: continuation of the truce, a monitoring and verification mechanism, and penalties for any violations. Operational details are expected to be finalised in Istanbul.Despite this, mistrust remains deep. Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militant groups responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, while Kabul accuses Pakistan of repeated violations of Afghan sovereignty. The Taliban also refuses to recognise the Durand Line, the internationally accepted boundary between the neighbours.Border closures in October caused significant economic losses, and more than 70 people were killed in recent clashes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul.

World Economic Forum BARS Iran FM’s Davos Entry After Khamenei Regime’s Deadly Crackdown On Protests





Iran’s foreign minister will skip this week’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with organisers saying on Monday that his presence would be inappropriate in the wake of Iran’s recent deadly crackdown on protesters.Abbas Araghchi had been listed as a speaker for Tuesday at the annual gathering of political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort. However, pressure mounted on organisers after rights activists urged them to withdraw the invitation, citing what they described as a “massacre” of civilians inside Iran.Confirming the decision on X, the World Economic Forum said: “The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos.” It added: “Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year.”Iran has been gripped by unrest since late December, when demonstrations driven by economic grievances spread rapidly across the country. The protests were widely viewed as one of the most serious challenges faced by the Iranian leadership in recent years.Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown, accompanied by a communications blackout that began on January 8. The protests have since largely subsided.Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters allegedly killed by security forces. According to the group, the figures are based on information from Iran’s health and medical system, eyewitnesses and other independent sources.The organisation cautioned that the actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The numbers cannot be independently verified by media outlets, and Iranian officials have not released an official casualty figure.","Abbas Araghchi had been listed as a speaker for Tuesday at the annual gathering of political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort.

Dubai/Manila, Jan 20, 2026:

Why Dubai and Manila flights expansion matters



Emirates Ramps Up Dubai–Manila Services Amid Surging Travel Demand

Dubai and Manila flights: Cargo capacity and trade flows get a lift



Stronger connectivity for communities and customers through Dubai and Manila flights



Emirates Boosts Dubai–Manila Connectivity in Major Win for OFWs

What the expansion of Dubai and Manila flights mean for travellers



More Seats, More Options: Extra flights mean greater availability and flexibility to match rising booking demand.

Extra flights mean greater availability and flexibility to match rising booking demand. Better Connections: Ideal flight times help reduce layovers to markets across the US, Canada and Europe.

Ideal flight times help reduce layovers to markets across the US, Canada and Europe. Enhanced Cargo Links: Increased bellyhold space helps exporters and SMEs move goods faster and more frequently.

Increased bellyhold space helps exporters and SMEs move goods faster and more frequently. Stronger Bilateral Ties: Reinforces UAE–Philippines economic and tourism cooperation under CEPA.





In a major boost for travel and trade between the UAE and the Philippines, Emirates Airline has announced it will add four additional weekly flights between Dubai and Manila starting April 2, 2026. The increase, a key part of Emirates’ Southeast Asia expansion strategy, will take the total weekly flights on this popular long-haul route from 28 to 34 services per week.The new flights will be scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and will be operated by Emirates’ wide-body Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, featuring premium cabins with First Class private suites, 42 lie-flat Business seats and 304 Economy seats. Passengers will benefit from expanded travel options, improved schedule flexibility and additional connections via Dubai to destinations across North America, Europe and the Middle East.The additional weekly frequencies underscore Emirates’ confidence in the Dubai–Manila air corridor, which serves not only holidaymakers and business travellers but also one of the world’s largest expatriate communities.The move comes as demand for international air travel rebounds strongly, particularly between the UAE and Southeast Asia, with Manila emerging as a key hub for leisure and corporate travel alike.The new flights will depart Dubai at 12:45 pm, arriving in Manila early the next morning, and return from Manila at 3:25 am, landing in Dubai at 8:25 am local time. The expanded schedule is designed to make long-haul itineraries more seamless, especially for travellers heading onward from Manila to major cities in Canada, the United States and Europe with improved connection spreads.Beyond passengers, the airline’s four added flights will significantly boost cargo capacity, with each Boeing 777 able to carry up to 20 tonnes of freight in the bellyhold even at full passenger load. This extra capacity is expected to strengthen imports and exports between the Philippines and global markets, particularly for industries like electronics, agricultural goods and e-commerce, by offering shippers more frequent and reliable bellyhold options.This logistics expansion aligns with broader economic cooperation between the UAE and the Philippines, which recently advanced their ties through a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) aimed at deepening trade, investment and mobility.For the large Filipino diaspora in the UAE, Europe and North America, the additional flights mean more flexibility and convenience when visiting families back home. Corporate travellers and seafarers are also likely to benefit from better timing options and more competitive pricing, particularly during peak periods of travel.Beginning in 1990, Emirates’ expanded schedule builds on its three-decade presence in the Philippines and complements its partnerships with Philippine Airlines to extend access to domestic destinations like Cebu, Clark and other regional points via seamless connections.Emirates travellers can book the new flights through the airline’s website, app, travel agents or Emirates retail locations ahead of the April launch.","Emirates Airline has announced it will add four additional weekly flights between Dubai and Manila starting April 2, 2026.

Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall, with powerful winter storms dumping several metres of snow and bringing daily life to a near standstill.Footage has emerged showing heavy snowfall in Russia that lasted for four days without interruption, blanketing residential areas, roads and buildings.In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the capital of Kamchatka Krai, road conditions remain “critical” after a series of storms battered the region with snow, ice and strong winds, reported The Moscow Times.Meteorologists said the level of snowfall recorded since early January has not been seen in more than 50 years. As per The Moscow Times, the average snow height in the city has reached around 170 cm, with drifts exceeding 2.5 metres in some neighbourhoods.In some areas, drifts have risen several metres high, blocking building entrances and burying cars almost completely.People were seen digging out their cars after a powerful snowstorm dumped several feet of snow across parts of Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, as visuals showed locals carving paths through towering snowbanks.Russian children were also seen enjoying the unusual conditions, sliding on snow piled up near multistorey buildings, while residents in some areas had fun snow-gliding and diving into massive drifts.The current record-breaking snowfall in Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula has seen drifts reach up to five metres (16 feet).City authorities declared a state of emergency after at least two elderly men were killed by snow falling from rooftops last week, as per The Moscow Times.Officials warned that icicles and heavy snow accumulation on roofs continue to pose serious risks, while prolonged snowfall has also raised avalanche concerns in residential areas.According to Reuters, Kamchatka has witnessed its heaviest snowfall in around 60 years, disrupting transport and forcing residents to adapt to extraordinary conditions.Life in the region remains severely affected as authorities race to clear roads and restore normal movement.","Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall.

'Trump Still A Friend': Netanyahu Publicly Opposes U.S. Board Of Peace For Gaza Governance





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday issued a stern warning to Iran’s Khamenei-led regime, vowing an “unprecedented” response if Tehran attacks Israel, Xinhua reported.Addressing the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu said, “If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known.”He said Israel was “closely” monitoring Iran, cautioning that “no one can predict what the future holds for Iran, but it will not return to what it once was,” a remark suggesting irreversible consequences for Tehran in the event of a conflict.The comments came as the United States was reportedly moving the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.Separately, Netanyahu addressed US-led proposals for Gaza’s post-war governance, under which Turkish and Qatari officials have been cited as potential participants in the US President Donald Trump-chaired “Board of Peace.”“We have a certain disagreement with our friends in the United States over the composition of the advisory board that will accompany the processes in Gaza,” Netanyahu said, adding that neither Turkish nor Qatari soldiers would be permitted to operate in the enclave.Israel has consistently opposed any Turkish role in Gaza and maintains uneasy ties with Qatar, despite Turkey and Qatar being among the key mediators between Israel and Hamas.","'If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known,' Netanyahu says.

Candace Owens reacts as Zach De Gregorio alleges legal pressure from Turning Point USA







Candace Owens and Turning Point USA are again at the center of a loud online storm. This time, it started after a YouTuber said the group sent him a legal warning. On Sunday, January 18, YouTube creator Zach De Gregorio, who runs the channel Wolves and Finance, claimed that Turning Point USA (TPUSA) sent him a cease and desist letter. He said the letter came after he raised questions about the group’s finances and drone use at an event.Soon after, Candace Owens, a political commentator and former TPUSA ally, reacted strongly. On X, she called the legal move a “terrible idea” and openly mocked the organization’s public relations strategy. Candace Owens questioned why TPUSA would take legal action instead of staying silent. She also offered her own services, saying she could help fix what she described as repeated PR mistakes.According to Zach De Gregorio, TPUSA accused him of making false and harmful claims. In a January 18 YouTube video, he said the organization told him that only one drone was allowed at the Utah Valley University event for media use. TPUSA also claimed his comments were defamatory, he said.Earlier, De Gregorio had pointed out mixed statements about drone use. He referenced comments from Frank Turek, who told Megyn Kelly that drones were present.At the same time, Brian Harpole, the head of Charlie Kirk’s security, said on a podcast that drones were not allowed because the university is close to an airport.An X user later supported De Gregorio’s concerns and questioned TPUSA’s explanation. That post caught Candace Owens’ attention.Owens replied with a sharp message on X, writing:“Difficult to put into words how terrible of an idea it was for Turning Point USA to send out this Cease and Desist letter. I’m at the point where I think someone internally absolutely detests Erika and permanently feeds her terrible ideas. It’s the only thing that makes sense at this point.”She added another post, offering help:“I again offer my consulting services to TPUSA. For a monthly retainer, we can end this corporate show.”Candace Owens has criticized TPUSA many times since Charlie Kirk’s death. On her podcast, she also mocked the group’s public response to claims involving Fort Huachuca.She questioned messages sent by Andrew Kolvet, TPUSA’s spokesperson, and said the replies looked rushed. Owens claimed that a third party confirmed to her that Erika Kirk was seen near the military base before Kirk’s death. These claims caused major debate online. TPUSA has not responded publicly to Owens’ latest remarks or to De Gregorio’s claims.","YouTube creator Zach De Gregorio claims Turning Point USA sent him a cease and desist letter.

'No Mercy, Executions Coming': Iran Shocks Trump With Big Declaration Against RIOTERS & CRIMINALS

Top developments from the Iran unrest

Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned any US strike would draw a “harsh and regrettable” response and called an attack on the Supreme Leader “all-out war”.

In a video message to Iranians on X, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince of Iran, said: “The battle in Iran today is between occupation and liberation. The Iranian people have called for me to lead. I will return to Iran.”

A regional Iranian official told Reuters at least 5,000 people, including around 500 security personnel, were killed; Kurdish regions saw the deadliest clashes.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged “several thousand” deaths in a televised address, blaming the United States and foreign-backed “rioters”.

Human rights groups report thousands of arrests during the crackdown.

Iran’s judiciary said detained protesters face charges of Mohareb (waging war against God), a capital offence under Iranian law.

US President Donald Trump called for “new leadership” in Iran and accused Khamenei of using unprecedented violence.

Trump claimed Tehran halted planned executions of 800 detainees and thanked Iranian authorities in a social media post.

Iran accused the US and Israel of orchestrating unrest; Pezeshkian repeated the allegation in a call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

NetBlocks said internet access briefly returned after 238 hours of shutdown on Sunday but was reportedly cut again on Monday after a limited, heavily filtered restoration of Google and messaging services.

Streets in Tehran and other cities reportedly returned to an uneasy calm on Sunday, with shops reopened and no fresh protests reported by state media.

(With inputs from agencies)





Iran’s state television channels were briefly hijacked on Sunday after anti-regime activists hacked Iran's Badr satellite, broadcasting opposition messaging and protest footage across multiple networks, The Times of Israel reported.Exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi appeared in the unauthorised segments urging Iranians to join demonstrations and calling on security forces to side with protesters. Iran-focused outlet Iran International first reported the disruption, while Israeli media said the breach involved the Badr satellite platform. Clips were later circulated by Pahlavi’s media team.According to the Jerusalem Post, the hijacked broadcast in the video also showed messages urging demonstrators to persist, interspersed with footage of solidarity rallies held across global cities and clips highlighting statements of support from international leaders.The broadcast hack comes amid weeks of unrest that began on December 28 over economic hardship and escalated into nationwide anti-government protests, followed by a sweeping crackdown, mass arrests and severe internet restrictions. A US-based rights group says it has verified thousands of deaths and arrests during the violent crackdown. Iranian authorities have blamed foreign adversaries for fuelling the unrest, while US President Donald Trump has publicly condemned Tehran’s response and warned of consequences if violence continues.","Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned any US strike would draw a “harsh and regrettable” response.

How the collision happened





At least 21 people were killed when a high-speed train derailed and collided with another train late Sunday in southern Spain.The regional emergency agency in Andalucía confirmed the death toll, while regional government president Juanma Moreno said the number of victims was expected to rise.The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear, with transport minister Óscar Puente describing the crash as “extremely strange” as it occurred on a straight section of track.The crash occurred in the early evening, with hundreds of survivors rescued amid darkness at the scene.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with Spanish broadcaster RTVE who was travelling on one of the trains, said that “there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,"" as cited by AP.He said passengers broke windows using emergency hammers, with some escaping without serious injuries. Footage shared from the scene showed people climbing out through windows as they fled the wreckage, with carriages tilted at sharp angles.The crash occurred at around 7.45 pm (local time) in Adamuz, in the southern province of Córdoba, Puente said.He said the rear carriages of the first train derailed and crossed onto the opposite track, where they struck another passing train, causing the front two carriages of the second service to also leave the rails.The first train was travelling from Málaga to Madrid and was privately operated, while the second, run by Spain’s national rail company, was bound for the southern city of Huelva, west of Seville.The Andalucía regional government set up an advanced medical post at the site to treat the injured, while the national rail operator and railway company assisted relatives of victims at stations in Madrid, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva.Paco Carmona, the head of Córdoba’s fire brigade, which is coordinating the rescue operation, told public television that emergency crews were prioritising efforts to reach victims still trapped in the two carriages most severely damaged in the crash, as cited by the New York Times.Spain’s state-owned rail infrastructure agency said rail traffic between Madrid and key southern Andalusian cities, including Córdoba, Seville, Málaga and Huelva, will be suspended on Monday.According to the International union of railways, Spain has the world’s second-longest high-speed rail network, behind China.","A high-speed train derailed and collided with another train in southern Spain.

Trump Posts From Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 15, 2026





President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace” is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body, with member countries invited to extend their participation beyond an initial three-year term by contributing more than $1 billion within the board’s first year.According to a draft charter reviewed by The New York Times, the board was originally conceived as part of Trump’s plan to oversee post-war administration in the Gaza Strip, the draft charter makes no mention of Gaza.The omission has fueled speculation that the body could be given a far broader mandate, potentially covering multiple global conflicts and even serving as a US-led alternative to the United Nations Security Council.A UN Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 had endorsed Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza and welcomed the creation of the board as a transitional authority to set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment. However, the charter appears to outline a significantly more expansive role than that described in Trump’s Gaza plan published in October 2025 or in the subsequent Security Council resolution.The draft charter was circulated with invitations to prospective members over the weekend. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the diplomacy involved, confirmed the document’s authenticity. Bloomberg had earlier reported the $1 billion buy-in requirement.On Friday, the White House announced that the board’s initial members would include secretary of state Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga. Other people included in the executive board are US special envoy Steve Witkoff, former UK PM Tony Blair, billionnare Marc Rowan and US national security advisor Robert Gabriel.- Canada- Turkey- Egypt- Paraguay- Argentina- Albania- India- Jordan- Greece- Cyprus- Pakistan- Hungary-Russian President Vladimir Putin- Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama- Argentine President Javier Milei- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney- Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides- Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni- Jordanian King Abdullah II- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif- Paraguayan President Santiago Pena- Romanian President Nicusor Dan- Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganTrump, who is set to chair the board, described it on Truth Social last week as “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though many details about its structure and operations remain unclear.According to the charter, the board’s mission is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” and to carry out peace-building functions in line with international law.The document states that the board is expected to meet for votes at least once a year, with its expenses funded through voluntary contributions from member states and other sources.","President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace” is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body.

— Mel (@Villgecrazylady) January 18, 2026 A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

After Greenland Bid, Trump Warns Canada’s Arctic Is Exposed To Rivals Russia & China





US President Donald Trump late Sunday once again strongly reiterated his desire to bring Greenland under American control, claiming that Denmark had failed to counter the “Russian threat” to the Arctic island and declaring that “now it is time, and it will be done. ”In a post on Truth Social, Trump renewed his allegations against Denmark to justify his push for Greenland. He wrote, “Nato has been telling Denmark for 20 years that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”At the start of 2026, Trump has made his intentions increasingly clear. He began with a US strike on Venezuela that led to the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently taken into American custody along with his wife. Trump then turned his attention to Greenland, saying the island should come under US control.However, both the Danish and Greenlandic governments have strongly opposed Trump’s proposal, with several European Union leaders also backing them and questioning the US president’s motives regarding the Arctic island.Earlier, Trump also threatened tariffs on any countries who don't abide by his motive of acquiring Greenland.European nations including Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom released a joint statement, which was later shared by Danish ministry of foreign affairs, said that the military exercise ""Arctic Endurance"" poses no threat to anyone and stressed on full solidarity with Denmark and people of Greenland.The statement also warned that the threat of tariffs could undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.On Saturday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the United Kingdom and other European countries unless they agreed to sell Greenland. He claimed the move was necessary for national security, citing Chinese and Russian interest in the territory.Trump offered to negotiate with European nations but warned that tariffs could escalate to 10 percent from February 1, 2026, and 25 percent from June 1, 2026, if no deal was reached, saying it was “time for Denmark to give back” after years of US support.The people of Greenland also voiced their resistance to Trump by holding protests across the snow-covered island, among the first such demonstrations of its kind there.Meanwhile, Trump also wrote to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, citing the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize and declaring that he no longer felt bound to “think purely of peace,” even as he repeatedly threatened action over Greenland. According to a letter obtained by Bloomberg, the message, first reported by a PBS journalist on X, was circulated by Trump’s National Security Council to several other European governments.","US President Donald Trump once again strongly reiterated his desire to bring Greenland under American control.

Mary L Trump, the niece of Donald Trump , weighed in on a letter sent by the US president to Norway’s prime minister, in which the GOP leader linked America’s bid to annex Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize Posting on X, Mary Trump said: “When I saw this letter, I literally thought, ‘This is too stupid even for him.’ I should have known better.”Her comment followed reports detailing Trump’s message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, which has stirred fresh controversy over Greenland, Nato and global security.According to the message, Trump told Støre he no longer felt obliged to focus only on peace after not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year. He blamed Norway for the decision, despite being told that the prize is awarded by an independent committee, not the Norwegian government. The prize was given to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado in 2025. Few days ago, Machado presented her medal to Trump in the White House.In the same letter, Trump insisted that US needed “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”, the semi-autonomous Danish territory.Asked later whether he would use force to seize it, Trump replied “no comment”.Denmark governs Greenland and is a Nato member. It warned that any US military action against the island would effectively end the alliance. Several European Nato members sent small numbers of troops to Greenland last week in a reconnaissance mission.Trump responded by announcing a 10 per cent tariff on goods from eight Nato allies starting from February 1. He warned the tariff could rise to 25 per cent by June if countries opposed his plan to take control of Greenland.In his reply to Støre, Trump wrote: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.” He also questioned Denmark’s claim to Greenland, saying there were no written documents proving ownership.“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,” Trump added.The MAGA chief concluded by saying the world was not secure unless the US had “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”.Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, saying he ended eight wars during his second term.Mary Trump is a psychologist and outspoken critic of her president uncle.

Who is Ahmad Jihad Bojeh?

Prior arrest and mental health history





A 29-year-old Florida man, identified by authorities as Ahmad Jihad Bojeh, is facing murder charges after three tourists were found shot to death near Walt Disney World.Bojeh was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with three counts of first-degree murder after authorities say he carried out an unprovoked, “cold-blooded” shooting of three men vacationing in the area.According to the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to reports of gunfire around 12:13 p.m. Saturday at a rental home located on Indian Point Circle in the Indian Hills subdivision of Kissimmee, a neighborhood frequently used by tourists visiting Walt Disney World.When deputies arrived, they found three men dead from gunshot wounds in front of the home. Sheriff Christopher Blackmon described the killings as random and premeditated and added that there was no known conflict between the suspect and the victims.“This was just random,” Blackmon said. “And this happened to be the person who lived next door.”Authorities identified the victims as: Robert Lewis Kraft, 70, of Holland, Michigan; Douglas Joseph Kraft, 68, of Columbus, Ohio; and James John Puchan, 69, of Columbus, Ohio.Robert and Douglas Kraft were brothers. The men were staying at the rental property as tourists. Investigators said a fourth member of their group had left the property the day before, and the remaining three were stranded due to car trouble, which forced them to extend their stay.Ahmad Jihad Bojeh lived next door to the rental home where the victims were staying. Sheriff Blackmon described him as a “troubled person,” and a frequent subject of law enforcement calls in the neighborhood.“I can tell you he was a threat to that neighborhood all the time,” Blackmon said. “He was a known person, a frequent flier to the sheriff’s office.”Bojeh was taken into custody about an hour after the shooting and found inside his residence without incident.According to the court records, Bojeh was previously arrested in 2021 after allegedly firing a gun at a person and multiple vehicles in a Wawa gas station parking lot in Kissimmee, injuring one man. Surveillance video from that incident reportedly showed Bojeh shooting at passing cars.Despite video and witness evidence, Bojeh was later found not guilty by reason of insanity, with a competency hearing scheduled in that case. Sheriff Blackmon said concerns about Bojeh persisted after that ruling.Following his arrest in the current case, detectives executed a search warrant at Bojeh’s home and recovered two firearms. Authorities are investigating whether either weapon was used in the killings.Bojeh is currently being held at the Osceola County Jail without bond. Officials say there is no ongoing threat to the community, but the investigation remains in its early stages.","Ahmad Jihad Bojeh, 29, was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with three counts of first-degree murder.

Giant Trump–Epstein Birthday Card Installation Sparks Controversy Near US Capitol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/happy-birthday-to-a-terrific-guy-trumpepstein-birthday-message-recreated-in-giant-10-ft-mockup-near-us-capitol/articleshow/126715599.cms,"Source: X

Activist group invites public participation



Netizens react



Disputed letter resurfaces amid broader protest trend





A ten-foot installation invoking the Trump–Epstein birthday letter controversy has been placed on the National Mall, visually enlarging a document Donald Trump has long denied authoring and pushing it back into the political spotlight.The structure stands across from the US Capitol at 3rd Street between Madison and Jefferson Drive. One side of the installation reproduces the alleged birthday letter attributed to Donald Trump, bordered by a drawing of a woman. The text includes the line, “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” and ends with, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday— and may every day be another wonderful secret.”The reverse side features a shorter message: “Happy Birthday to a ‘Terrific Guy!’”, surrounded by balloon imagery. Together, the two panels form a giant mockup of the birthday card that has been the subject of renewed political scrutiny in recent months. The timing of the installation is apt, as January 20 is the birth date of Jeffrey Epstein.The installation was created by an organization calling itself the Secret Handshake, which described the statue as an interactive protest rather than a static monument. Visitors are encouraged to “sign” the oversized card with messages addressed to the administration.Placed beside the mockup is a smaller sculpture depicting stacked boxes meant to resemble redacted files. A plaque accompanying the display reads:“The Secret Handshake invites you to celebrate the birthday of President Donald Trump’s ‘closest friend,’ Jeffrey Epstein, with a larger than life tribute to their intimate correspondence.Feel Free To Sign The Birthday Card With Your Own Message To The Administration.”The group said the statue was installed overnight on Sunday, deliberately timed to appear one day before Epstein’s birthday. According to the Secret Handshake, the installation has been granted permission to remain on the National Mall until Friday.Few people have already started arriving there and they are dropping messages. A picture posted online shows what people have written. One visitor wrote, ""History has its eyes on you!""While someone else etched with a colored pen, ""The time is always right to the right thing. IMPEACH.""The news of the statue has spread on the internet. Netizens are reacting to the wild statue. One user said, ""HOLY SMOKES: A giant replica of the Trump-to-Epstein birthday card just got planted on the National Mall in D.C. today. Front reads: “Happy Birthday to a ‘Terrific Guy!’” And the inside is printed with the bizarre Trump–Epstein dialogue. Sometimes the receipts don’t need a caption. They need a billboard.""Another commented, ""Trump should stroll out there today and sign it""""lmfao this is golden."" wrote third.The birthday message referenced by the statue was released in September by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. The letter, dated 2003, was attributed to Trump during Epstein’s 50th birthday celebrations. Trump has denied writing or sending it, calling the document “false, malicious, and defamatory.”The mockup is the latest in a series of anti-Trump installations that have appeared on the National Mall in recent months. Previous displays have included a statue depicting Trump holding hands with Epstein, a large gold thumb crushing the Statue of Liberty’s head, a sculpture of Trump dancing inside a gold television set, a “giant bronze poop” statue referencing the January 6 insurrection, and multiple smaller versions of the same theme.",A ten-foot installation invoking the Trump–Epstein birthday letter controversy has been placed on the National Mall.

Danish parliamentary member Rasmus Jarlov hoped US President Donald Trump's aide Stephen Miller is kept away from young women, as Miller has the mentality of a rapist, Jarlov said, referring to his recent aggressive comment on Denmark.

They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years. To control a territory, you have to be able to defend a territory, improve a territory, inhabit a territory.

You can’t defend yourself, so I’m going to take you. That’s basically what he’s saying.”“United States have signed several treaties with Denmark recognizing the ownership, one of them was in 1917,” Jarlov said.“So, this is a new position from the American government, and we have to be able to trust the promises, the words and the alliances that we make with the Americans, because otherwise it’s not worth anything, being an ally of the Americans,” he said. “And I think it’s very crucial that we stay together because our alliance, our partnership, has kept us safe.In the latest development on Greenland, Trump has now claimed that he will acquire Greenland as he didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize.

2. Not having enough ties to the US

3. Getting convicted

4. Failing to pay taxes

5. Making a false claim to the USCIS

7. Suspicion of a fake marriage

8. Misrepresentation to immigration officials

9. Notify USCIS within 10 days every time you move

10. Voluntary abandonment





A Green Card is no longer a guarantee to stay in the US permanently, the Donald Trump administration has made it clear, as it arrested Green Card holder activists, deported them flagging them as national security risks. Nationals of 75 countries will not get Green Cards now, the administration announced as it examines how much welfare benefits they are taking. Immigration attorney Moumita Rahman, in a recent YouTube video, discussed how people unintentionally put themselves at risks by doing these 10 mistakes:A Green Card holder is allowed to travel and work abroad but these trips, if they are longer than six months, can be used to prove that an individual has abandoned his or her residency. It is advised to spend at least 9-10 months in the USNot having enough ties to the US can put an individual at risk of losing his or her Green Card. But a real, fixed address, US bank account, US credit card, filing tax, and having a job, having other family members, school-aged children can solve this situationThe attorney explained that this is not about getting a speeding ticket or a parking ticket but serious offences like fraud, theft, shoplifting, domestic abuse, causing physical harm to anyone etc.USCIS is checking tax compliance more than ever. Green Card holders should unfailingly fill Form 1040 to report their income to the Internal Revenue Service to inform the government how much you earned, how much tax you owe or how much refund you should get.Even if the false claim happens by mistake, this is an unredeemable and Green Card will get revoked if you claim yourself as a US citizen on any form, if you register to vote or actually vote or try to get US passport.90 days before your conditional Green Card expires, you have to file Form I-751, not earlier and not after expiry. This form converts your conditional Green Card into a permanent Green Card but if you fail to file within the stipulated time, you lose your Green Card and get deported.Even real couples can trigger the suspicion of a fake, paid marriage if they do not have a shared life.This does not have to be big lies but deliberate suppression of facts to immigration officials can cost yout Green Card.

— Secretary Kristi Noem (@Sec_Noem) January 19, 2026





The Department of Homeland Security on Monday announced that more than 10,000 illegal immigrants have been arrested in the Minneapolis area since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, a claim that comes amid widespread protests against the administration’s deportation drive and intensified demonstrations following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said nearly 3,000 arrests have occurred in the past six weeks alone, following a significant surge of federal agents deployed to the region.According to DHS, personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security Investigations, and other agencies have been involved in the operation.“PEACE AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN MINNEAPOLIS!” Noem wrote in a post on X, claiming those arrested included individuals convicted of serious crimes such as murder, sexual assault, and child exploitation.She accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of failing to protect residents by opposing aggressive federal enforcement measures.Mayor Frey drew national attention Sunday after describing the expanded ICE presence as an “invasion” during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He has repeatedly criticised the federal response as excessive.Noem also alleged widespread fraud tied to Minnesota’s social services system, asserting that investigators are probing what she claimed could total at least $19 billion in fraudulent activity.“There is MASSIVE Fraud in Minneapolis, at least $19 billion, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Our Homeland Security Investigators are on the ground in Minneapolis, conducting wide scale investigations to get justice for the American people who have been robbed blind. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN,” she wrote.The figure exceeds previous estimates cited by federal prosecutors, who have publicly referenced billions in alleged misuse of state and federal funds. DHS officials say Homeland Security Investigations agents are actively conducting inquiries across the Minneapolis area.The announcement comes amid massive protests across the US following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis mother of three, who was killed by an ICE agent earlier this month. Her death has sparked huge outrage, with activists demanding accountability and an end to what they describe as violent ICE tactics.In response to ongoing protests, the Pentagon confirmed that approximately 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska have been placed on standby for potential deployment. Mayor Frey has called the move a “ridiculous” overreaction, emphasising that most demonstrations have remained peaceful.On Sunday, the Department of Justice announced it is investigating protesters who disrupted services at a St. Paul church where a local ICE official reportedly serves as a pastor. Livestreamed footage from Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed demonstrators chanting “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good” inside the church.","DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said nearly 3,000 arrests have occurred in the past six weeks alone.

'Annoyed with sanitation': How missing garbage bins triggered NYC’s strangest urban crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/annoyed-with-sanitation-how-missing-garbage-bins-triggered-nycs-strangest-urban-crisis/articleshow/126706247.cms,"Trash talk: No bins in stock



No bin in NYC?







Who thought a bunch of garbage cans would have New Yorkers rushing to stores and dialling up authorities? But, it seems the administration can make them do it all.As a part of an anti-rat push by the City Hall, New Yorkers were told they had to start using official NYC garbage cans for trash pickup. As per the mandate, every building with one to nine units would have to use the official ""NYC Bin"" when they put out their trash by this summer or else face a fine.However, the residents are facing tough luck finding the bins for purchase as the city government blames an outside vendor for the issues. “Online ordering and the call centre are currently unavailable. Select NYC Bins are available at all NYC Home Depot locations,” states the Sanitation Department website.In a conversation with The Post, a Brooklynite revealed that the bins were out of stock at Home Depot. “How can we not find a consistent supply of these cans without using a Home Depot and an out-of-state manufacturer who can’t even supply them?” they said.Another, ordered a bin back in October 2025, which never arrived. And when they contacted the Department of Sanitation, the phone lines were down and the website proved to be useless.“I sort of got a little tired, and I felt like, to tell the truth, I’m really annoyed with sanitation,” said the 76-year-old Michael Monopoli to the outlet. “I never got the pail. And when I went to call you, the Department of Sanitation, you close down your phone and your website. So how am I supposed to get a ticket from you?”As per the city, the vendor that makes the bins is ""failing to fulfil some orders"" and people should email the manufacturer, Otto Environmental Systems, for refunds. However, the company also advised people to go to Home Depot to purchase the bins. “We are committed to restoring home delivery as quickly as possible to ensure the success of this important program,” a spokesperson for Otto Environmental Systems said.People are frustrated to see an idea that is normal in numerous cities, fail in execution in NYC. “It seems like only in New York can you try to match a standard idea from across the country and struggle so much to accomplish it,” they said.Others have noticed that sanitation workers themselves have been struggling to work with the bins. “It has a latch. They have to drag it over to the truck, flip it up, and then take the bags, throw them out, and then they have to just throw it back where it went and then move on,” they shared. “Before they had a flow. They just grabbed the bags from the curb, tossed them and kept going. It’s like a whole extra step. It’s a lot.”The idea was proposed by former NYC mayor Eric Adams amid his ""War on Rats."" However, it was the City Council that passed legislation to reimburse middle-class homeowners for the approximately $50 bins.While New Yorkers set out their trash in any 55-gallon lidded bin as of now, by June they need to have the NYC-branded bins, or else be fined $50.","New Yorkers were told they had to start using official NYC garbage cans for trash pickup.

Netizens react to the viral clip







Greenland is not for sale and every person inhabiting the Danish island is making it clear, raising their voice as loud as it takes to reach the ears of ambitious American President Donald Trump. After thousands of Greenlanders marched through the streets on Saturday to protest against the pressure from the US to take control of the territory, a politician from the island is raising her voice again.In a video going viral over the internet, Greenlandic politician Tillie Martinussen boldly rejected the American ambitions toward the island, highlighting how Americans are ""rich"" yet ""greedy"" and Greenlanders would never want to join the country.""We don't really value cash, Kardashian lips and fake boobs, very highly. Actually, you can not even own land in Greenland. You can get allotment for your house, which you own the house on top of the land,"" she revealed.""Greenlanders don't believe that the land is for one person, nor is the sea. It's a big miscalculation if he thinks Greenlanders would be incited by cash or something like that. We are not,"" claimed Martinussen.She added how the people of the island would not give up free healthcare, education, being a part of Europe, sovereignty, and more. “We do not want to be rich like the Americans are, see how greedy they are, even trying to shoot or invade their friends just for greed.The politician added that the Greenlanders are aware of the riches, such as minerals in their underground, but even if they were not present, they still would not be willing to merge with America. “Everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska, and the native tribes, Indians, American-Indians. Their land was taken from them, and they were not treated well.”“We know Trump has surrounded himself with, white power people, and we are not white. We are people of colour. We know our rights would likely be taken away,” she added invoking the current condition of American domestic politics.People in the comments noted how being rich Americans was no longer a point of prestige, but rather something that people would resist being. They also noted Martinussen's insulting take on America with some lauding it and others criticising.""That is not a throwaway jab, it is a full moral indictment. It flips the usual American self-image on its head: wealth is not automatically admired, and power is not automatically respected,"" wrote a person in an X post.""This is what Trump has done to America's reputation. Disgusting!"" added another social media user.""The fact that they see the U.S. as white power, that greed is running high, and that they are people of colour who don’t trust our government says a lot."" claimed another.""Yep that's a thousand pointer,"" added another.On January 17, thousands of Greenlanders took to the streets to protest the American demand. In Nuuk, the capital, demonstrators waved national flags and carried signs reading, ""Greenland is not for sale"" as they walked from the city centre to the US Consulate. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also joined the march at a point, raising the flag as the crowd cheered.","Greenlandic politician Tillie Martinussen boldly rejected the American ambitions toward the island.

Trump ‘STEALS’ Machado's Nobel Medal, Brands It Reward for ‘Work Done’; Move Seals New Caracas Plan?





US President Donald Trump told Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace” after Norway declined to award him the Nobel Peace Prize Hours after Trump's message became public, the Norway Prime Minister revealed that the exchange began with a message from Støre on January 18, sent on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.“Dear Mr President, dear Donald – on the contact across the Atlantic – on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine – and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we should all work to take this down and de-escalate – so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today – with both of us or separately – give us a hint of what you prefer! Best – Alex and Jonas,” it read.Trump responded linking his stance on Greenland to the Nobel Peace Prize. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” he wrote. He added: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Støre later clarified that the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by an independent committee, not the Norwegian government. “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to president Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government,” he said.Trump’s message escalates a dispute over Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark. Last Saturday, he announced a 10% import tax on goods from eight European countries, including Norway, to pressure them into negotiations over the Arctic island. European governments strongly rebuked the move, while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged de-escalation, saying: “I think this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion. ”Thousands of Greenlanders protested over the weekend against any attempt to seize their territory. Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen declared on Facebook: “We will not be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect, and on international law.”Trump’s pursuit of the prize has been public, including his receipt of a medal last week from Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.","US President Donald Trump told Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace” after Norway declined to award him the Nobel Peace Prize.

Trump ‘STEALS’ Machado's Nobel Medal, Brands It Reward for ‘Work Done’; Move Seals New Caracas Plan?





Tensions between the United States and its European allies are escalating this week after US President Donald Trump sent an extraordinary message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, linking his renewed push to acquire Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize In the message, sent over the weekend and confirmed by Oslo, the MAGA supremo argued that the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize had altered his approach to diplomacy.""Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace,"" Trump wrote, in what was widely seen as an astonishing show of petulance. He added that while peace would remain “predominant,” he would now prioritize “what is good and proper for the United States.""Trump went on to restate his long-held view that Greenland—an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark—is a strategic “security necessity” for the US, asserting that Denmark lacks the capacity to protect the island from growing Russian or Chinese influence in the Arctic. He also questioned Denmark’s historical claim to the territory, suggesting that earlier American exploration gave the US a competing interest.“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,” Trump wrote, opening a historical can of worms since America itself was settled by Europeans landing there on boats. Going further back, the American continent was populated by Asians from Russia coming through the Bering Straits, and eventually becoming Native Americans.Following Trump's first settler argument, the US President and his MAGA acolytes were trolled by French gadabouts who reminded them that without French intervention at Yorktown in the American war for Independence, there would have been no United States as currently constituted. “The world is not secure unless historical debts are properly recognized. Therefore, it is both good and proper to consider the orderly transfer of the United States under French stewardship, in the interest of competence, culture, and cuisine,” wrote one snarky critic.Norwegian PM Store responded to Trump’s grievance by reiterating that the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by an independent committee appointed by Norway’s parliament, not by the government. “I have several times clearly explained this to President Trump,” Store said, seeking to distance Oslo from the Nobel decision that has become something of a desperate fixation with the US President to the extent that he accepted it second hand from the 2025 winner, Venezuela’s opposition leader Maria Machado.Trump’s message, which was leaked in Washington by European embassies which reportedly received it from the NSC, marked a significant escalation in a dispute that has already seen the US. threaten a 10% tariff on imports from eight European countries—including Denmark, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway—that would take effect on February 1, rising to 25% by June unless negotiations over Greenland move forward.The controversy has reverberated across Europe. European Union officials have called an emergency summit to discuss possible retaliatory trade measures, with some diplomats warning of a “dangerous downward spiral” that could damage the Nato alliance. Some EU members are pressing for activation of its ""anti-coercion instrument,"" dubbed as ""trade bazooka,"" which could impose countermeasures like export controls or market restrictions on the US. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated Europe ""will not be blackmailed,"" echoing sentiments from French President Emmanuel Macron, who is pushing for unified retaliation.Analysts in the US alarmed that Trump’s messaging risks sinking Nato and ties with Europe. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, described it as “an unprecedented mix of personal grievance and power politics,” warning that linking national security objectives to international awards risks undermining US credibility. Anne-Marie Slaughter, former director of policy planning at the US State Department, called it ""bonkers"" on social media, suggesting it exemplifies behavior that ""the 25th Amendment is for,"" referring to the constitutional provision for removing an unfit president.Even Republican lawmakers are gobsmacked by Trump’s Nobel tantrum, accusing some of his advisors for triggering his Greenland grab. ""The fact that a small handful of 'advisors' are actively pushing for coercive action to seize the territory of an ally is beyond stupid. It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the Nato alliance over the years,"" North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, currently in Denmark with a Congressional delegation, said.The 11-member delegation, led by Democrat Chris Coons, is attempting to reassure Danish and Greenlandic politicians of US support even as the executive is running amok. ""Greenland is a part of Denmark. Denmark is our Nato ally. That should be the end of this discussion,"" Coons said over the weekend, acknowledging that while “our very positive relationships have dimmed a bit… I hope that the people of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people. ”","US President Donald Trump sent an extraordinary message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, linking his renewed push to acquire Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan has been kept in solitary confinement and barred from meeting his lawyers or family for over three months, his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said on Monday. The restrictions came after Khan made critical remarks about Pakistan's army chief Marshal Asim Munir, calling him “a mentally unstable person” following a jail meeting with his sister on December 4.Khan, 73, has been incarcerated since August 2023, following his arrest after his government was toppled in April 2022. Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalise a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by Indian security forces during Operation Sindoor. Kasuri's speech was made from a school, with hundreds of children visible in the audience, while Azhar too seemingly addressed a public gathering, sources said.The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed. He asserted that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with ""martyrdom"", explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles, or foreign visas.""They only ask Allah for 1 thing: martyrdom,"" the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadres.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a ""hollow threat"" and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM's infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.""This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ""torn to pieces"", as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,"" said a source.Interestingly, Masood Azhar was not seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location. This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan.Security agencies are now closely analysing the voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","A new audio recording, purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar, has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

Erika Kirk accuses Candace Owens of profiting from conspiracy theories in viral CBS clip





Erika Kirk no longer hides her frustration. More than three months after the killing of her husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk , his widow has stepped into the public arena with a message shaped by grief and resolve. What began as quiet mourning has turned into a firm stand against conspiracy theories that refuse to fade. A recent television appearance captured that shift in real time and sent a clip racing across social media.The moment was brief but striking. As Erika Kirk sat for a CBS News interview, her calm expression changed instantly when Candace Owens’ name surfaced. Laughter stopped. Her gaze hardened. Viewers described it as a death stare, but the meaning was clear. For Kirk, this was not a media moment. It was a line being drawn.In the upcoming CBS primetime special with editor in chief Bari Weiss, Erika Kirk directly confronted the narratives surrounding Charlie Kirk’s death. She accused Owens of amplifying false claims and exploiting tragedy for personal gain. Speaking plainly, Kirk said, “She has been one of the main peddlers of these conspiracies.”Her criticism did not stop there. As the discussion turned to motives and monetization, Kirk added, “She is making a huge amount of money on it.She is building her business off these lies.” The comments landed with force, reflecting months of anger that had stayed largely private until now.Owens, a prominent conservative commentator known for challenging official accounts, has repeatedly questioned the circumstances of Charlie Kirk’s killing. She has suggested it was a targeted hit and claimed access to secret sources. Those statements, according to Erika Kirk, have deepened her family’s pain and fueled online speculation.When asked what she wanted Owens and others spreading misinformation to do, Kirk did not hesitate. Her answer was short and unmistakable. “Stop. That’s it. Stop.”Beyond the viral clip, Kirk also spoke about forgiveness, privacy, and the decision to keep parts of her family’s life shielded from public view. She emphasized that grief does not require performance and truth does not need exaggeration.As debates continue online, Erika Kirk’s message stands apart. It is not about politics or clicks. It is about drawing boundaries and demanding humanity in the aftermath of loss.Also Read: Candace Owens drops bombshell claim that Tyler Robinson did not act alone in Charlie Kirk killing as court case intensifies","Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has publicly denounced Candace Owens for allegedly profiting from conspiracy theories surrounding her husband's death.

Candace Owens' 9/11 style attack post resurfaces after Brown University shooting





Shock and grief swept through Providence after a deadly shooting near Brown University left at least two people dead and several others critically injured. As authorities worked through an active investigation and enforced a shelter in place order, social media took a darker turn. Amid the chaos, an old post by conservative commentator Candace Owens resurfaced, pulling the tragedy into a separate storm of online speculation.The renewed attention on Owens’ past remark quickly shifted the focus from victims and public safety to debate and outrage. Some users framed the resurfaced post as a prediction, while others pushed back hard, warning against drawing reckless conclusions during an unfolding crisis. The moment highlighted how quickly tragedy can be swept into ideological battles, often before facts have a chance to settle.The controversy centers on a previous X post by Owens that some online users linked to the Brown University shooting. In that post, Owens wrote, “They have been signaling that a 9/11 style attack is coming the second week of December. Save this tweet. It will age well.” The message did not cite evidence or name specific threats, but its reappearance sparked fierce debate.Critics were quick to point out the sharp differences between the September 11 attacks and the Providence shooting. One user questioned the logic outright, asking, “How would this make her right.” Others went further, speculating about foreknowledge without offering proof. Another post read, “Did #CandaceOwens know ? #brownuniversity shooting ? Terrorist attack ?.”Law enforcement has not identified a suspect or motive, and officials have made no connection between the shooting and terrorism. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed federal involvement, stating, “FBI personnel are on the scene and assisting this evening after the shooting at Brown University and we will provide all capabilities necessary. Please pray for all those involved. We will update with more information as we are able. ”As the investigation continues, the episode serves as a reminder of how quickly grief can be overshadowed by speculation. For now, authorities urge patience, restraint, and focus on the victims, not viral narratives built in the absence of facts.Also Read: Candace Owens drops bombshell claim that Tyler Robinson did not act alone in Charlie Kirk killing as court case intensifies","A deadly shooting near Brown University has led to a shelter-in-place order and a resurfaced post by conservative commentator Candace Owens.

VTuber Ironmouse shared an uncomfortable encounter, leading to a strong rebuttal from streamer RaKai. Their differing accounts have divided viewers and reignited discussions on boundaries at creator events. Another streamer, Ray, has since apologized to Ironmouse. This situation underscores the complexities of fame and personal space in the streaming world.

RaKai and Ironmouse Streamer Awards controversy sparks heated backlash





Tension from the Streamer Awards 2025 spilled into the Twitch world this week after Ironmouse publicly shared that an interaction at the event left her feeling deeply uncomfortable. The VTuber described shaking during the encounter, a revelation that quickly set social media buzzing. What might have remained a brief moment at a crowded awards show soon turned into a full blown online dispute.RaKai did not stay silent. During a livestream on December 12, the 16 year old streamer pushed back forcefully, questioning Ironmouse’s account and framing the interaction as admiration rather than intimidation. His reaction divided viewers and reignited wider conversations about boundaries, intent, and accountability at creator events that mix fame with close access.RaKai addressed Ironmouse’s comments head on, expressing disbelief that she felt uneasy during their exchange. He said he had approached her with respect and praise, arguing that the situation was being misrepresented. In a heated moment on stream, RaKai said:""I'mma stop her right here. B**ch, be for real! I'm talking about for the rest of the day, bro! B**ch, be fking for real, my n****! How the hell do you feel uncomfortable if you're not even...I'mma just chill. Let me chill, bro. Nah, f**k that! How the hell are you uncomfortable when literally she told us, she said, 'Ask me anything.' She said, 'Ask me anything,' bro! I actually look up to Ironmouse. Okay? I say, 'Yo, Ironmouse, you're a legend, bro. You're a legend.' So how the hell do you feel uncomfortable, bro? You feel me?""He went on to argue that Ironmouse should have clearly ended the conversation if she truly felt uneasy. RaKai suggested that a direct request to step away would have changed everything, adding that he would have respected such a boundary immediately.The situation took another turn when Ray, who was present during the interaction, issued an apology to Ironmouse. He acknowledged her discomfort and stated that he no longer wishes to engage with her content. That contrast in responses has shaped much of the online reaction.As debates rage on, the controversy highlights a growing challenge in streaming culture. Public praise, personal space, and power dynamics collide quickly in real world settings. For many viewers, this moment has become less about one interaction and more about how creators listen when discomfort is voiced.Also Read: “I’m ugly”: Ironmouse blasts invasive question about her real-life appearance, says Streamer Awards moment left her shaken"," VTuber Ironmouse shared an uncomfortable encounter, leading to a strong rebuttal from streamer RaKai.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

Candace Owens' Tyler Robinson claims raise fresh doubts in Charlie Kirk case





Candace Owens has once again pushed herself to the center of a national firestorm, reviving questions that many believed were settled. As Tyler Robinson made his first in person appearance in a Utah courtroom, the legal case surrounding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk took on a sharper political and media edge. What unfolded inside the courtroom was serious. What followed online was explosive.Robinson, a 22 year old Utah man, faces aggravated murder and several related charges tied to the September 10 shooting at Utah Valley University. Prosecutors maintain he acted alone. Owens disagrees. Her renewed claims have fueled debate across social media, cable news, and political circles, adding pressure to an already volatile case. As cameras rolled under strict court rules, the trial moved forward under intense public scrutiny.The courtroom scene itself was tightly controlled. Robinson appeared in civilian clothes, restrained but composed, smiling briefly toward family members as Judge Tony F. Graf Jr. emphasized the presumption of innocence. Outside the courtroom, however, the narrative fractured.Owens addressed the controversy directly on social media, dismissing online speculation based on courtroom footage.She rejected interpretations drawn from lip reading videos and facial expressions, calling those reports fictional. According to Owens, Robinson’s reaction in court had nothing to do with guilt or secret signals.She said Robinson and his attorney had just learned that their security vehicle had been involved in a minor crash, a situation she claimed had occurred before. Owens also challenged prosecutors to back up their case publicly. While she stated she believes Robinson was involved on September 10, she drew a clear line beyond that.Owens said she does not believe Robinson pulled the trigger and does not believe he acted alone. Her remarks directly contradict statements from prosecutors, who have said the evidence shows Robinson acted by himself. The state is seeking the death penalty, raising the stakes even higher.Judge Graf allowed cameras in court but imposed limits after concerns that earlier footage showed restraints and private defense discussions. Media groups argued transparency protects public trust, while Robinson’s legal team warned coverage could taint a jury pool.Meanwhile, Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow and CEO of Turning Point USA, has called for transparency while condemning conspiracy theories. She defended the legal process and criticized public figures who, in her view, inflamed speculation.As the case heads toward its next hearing, the courtroom remains one arena. The public debate, driven by powerful voices, shows no signs of quieting down.Also Read: Candace Owens’ war with TPUSA leadership turns personal after Tyler Bowyer’s divorce jab","Candace Owens has reignited controversy surrounding the Charlie Kirk killing, challenging prosecutors' claims that Tyler Robinson acted alone.

""Only in America can an overweight woman with brand new nails cry about not having money and then complain that her job sucks because she has to watch YouTube videos.

Next, she's going to tell us she got PTSD from reading mean comments.""

Asmongold’s reaction sparks debate over streaming pressures





Twitch streamer Asmongold set off an uproar after reacting to Frogan's recent tearful Twitch stream in which she talked about the trials and tribulations of being a content creator. Frogan had spoken about financial stress, the mental strains of streaming, and the pressure of keeping up with trends to stay relevant. Whereas many viewers shared in her plight, it was Asmongold's candid, albeit unpopular, response that captured most people's attention in mere moments. An outspoken streamer, he used Twitter to give his opinion, thus firing up debates across the board.Asmongold tweeted,He directly attacked the content of Frogan's complaints, bringing up elements of her lifestyle and suggesting that perhaps her issues were blown out of proportion.The tweet immediately polarized the audience. Some people took Asmongold's side, saying too many creators get perks, financial support, and opportunities that make such complaints seem very minute.Others took the side of Frogan, citing even successful streamers go through burnout, mental health issues, and, above all, money uncertainty. Fans stressed that content is not at all easy to provide in a competitive environment where subscriber numbers can go down or up, along with constant engagement expected.This has fueled broader discussions about the realities of streaming culture, the juxtaposition between the personal struggles of creators and the struggles as perceived by their peers and viewers. While Frogan came forward in good faith, Asmongold's response underlined the harsh judgment online personalities can get, even from fellow streamers.Ultimately, the discussion reveals that content creation is seldom as straightforward as it might seem. Streaming may yield fame and rewards, but it does not leave one without financial burdens, mental stress, and a continuous sense of judgment either. Whether controversial or not, Asmongold's response serves to further a valuable discussion of privilege, public perception, and the difficulties often hidden behind one's screen.Also Read: Ethan Klein claps back at Frogan’s Twitch complaints about streaming and mods","Twitch streamer Asmongold set off an uproar after reacting to Frogan's recent tearful Twitch stream in which she talked about the trials and tribulations of being a content creator.

“And Twitch streaming sucks. I fucking hate it.”

“lazy reaction”

Ethan Klein pushes back on Frogan’s Twitch rant about streaming, mods, and mental health

“I’ve been paying my mods for years btw.”





Twitch streamer Frogan recently went on an emotional stream to discuss the personal toll of content creation. She revealed that the year has been extremely challenging, citing depression, stress, and financial strain. Frogan explained she streamed only about 100 days in 2025 and described how legal battles, including a lawsuit from YouTuber Ethan Klein, have made it difficult to afford basic things, like holiday travel home. She also vented about paying her moderators out of pocket despite struggling with subscriber numbers, bluntly stating,Her candid remarks drew a sympathetic response from viewers and sparked wider conversation online.The tension between Frogan and Klein is part of a larger legal dispute. In June 2025, Klein’s company, Ted Entertainment, filed copyright lawsuits against Frogan, Denims, and Kaceytron. He alleges that they used substantial portions of his video Content Nuke – Hasan Piker with minimal commentary or transformative input, which he argues falls short of fair use. Klein’s goal is to distinguish between fair commentary and what he callsstreams that simply rebroadcast content with little added value.Critics, including political streamer Hasan Piker, have accused Klein of overreach and using copyright law against smaller creators.After Frogan’s stream gained attention, Ethan Klein reposted a clip on his Instagram Story with the caption:His response directly addressed Frogan’s claims about unpaid moderation and highlighted a broader debate about the financial and emotional realities of streaming. The exchange underscores the divide between creator expectations, fair compensation practices, and the pressures of producing content under legal scrutiny, while also drawing attention to how conflicts between smaller and larger creators can quickly become public and polarizing within the online community.Frogan’s emotional disclosure and Klein’s rebuttal have intensified discussions around streaming culture, mental health, and copyright in reaction content. While Frogan faces personal and financial challenges amplified by the lawsuit, Klein is focused on clarifying legal boundaries for derivative work on platforms like Twitch, sparking a larger conversation about how creators balance creative freedom with legal accountability.Also Read: xQc checks Google Trends against Hasan and is shocked by unexpected China interest","Twitch streamer Frogan recently went on an emotional stream to discuss the personal toll of content creation.

xQc roasts Hasan after spotting China traffic in Google Trends

“trying”

“everybody’s googling Hasan’s dog,”

“diabolical,”





During a recent livestream, xQc once again turned a casual on-stream moment into a viral talking point after pulling up Google Trends to compare his search popularity against other major creators, including Hasan. What started as a lighthearted numbers check quickly escalated when xQc switched the data to a worldwide view and noticed unexpected spikes from regions like China. The discovery immediately caught him off guard and set the tone for a string of jokes aimed directly at Hasan, with xQc suggesting the attention didn’t mean what it appeared to mean on the surface.The moment resonated with viewers because it combined internet metrics, creator rivalry, and ongoing streamer drama into one unfiltered reaction. As xQc scrolled through the data live, he mocked the idea that Hasan was gaining organic traction in China, sarcastically declaring that Chinese audienceshim. The chat erupted as xQc leaned into the bit, framing the results as less about genuine popularity and more about controversy-driven curiosity, something he’s repeatedly accused Hasan of benefiting from.Digging deeper into the Google Trends comparison, xQc framed the China-related search interest as part of a broader joke about Hasan’s recent attempts to connect with Chinese audiences. Hasan has faced criticism and censorship issues tied to China-focused content in the past, turning those efforts into a recurring meme within streaming circles. xQc leaned into that context, suggesting Hasan wasto reach that audience while not actually being embraced by it, at least in his view.The roast didn’t stop there. xQc followed up with another jab, claiming that any spike in Hasan’s search interest wasn’t really about Hasan at all. Instead, he joked thatreferencing the long-running controversy involving Hasan’s dog, Kaya, and accusations surrounding the use of a shock or vibration collar. xQc has repeatedly criticized Hasan over the issue in previous streams, and he framed the Google Trends bump asimplying people were searching for the scandal rather than the streamer.As with many xQc moments, the segment blended humor, rivalry, and real-time data in a way that instantly clipped well and spread across social media. While clearly exaggerated for entertainment, the comments tapped into existing narratives around Hasan’s controversies and global reach.In the end, the Google Trends check wasn’t about statistics as much as spectacle. xQc turned a simple analytics tool into another viral roast, reinforcing how quickly streamer rivalries can turn even search data into content fuel.Also Read: Kick faces potential nationwide ban in France after Jean Pormanove’s on-stream death"," xQc roasts streamer Hasan after spotting China traffic in Google Trends.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not typically transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may sometimes be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar-based holidays allows UAE residents to strategically plan their annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can significantly maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these early predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates.

Far side exploration



Learning from the first attempt



Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there successfully. The rover’s work will provide valuable data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. I know Apple is going to be happy. Nobody talked to me more about it than Tim Cook. He said it's a real problem. And it's not going to be a problem anymore... The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card"" Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals.

"Why robotics pioneer, the Roomba co-creator, is skeptical about his field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-robotics-pioneer-the-roomba-co-creator-is-skeptical-about-his-field/articleshow/125956719.cms,"



In the 1980s, limitations on computing constrained robot development. Watching insects, pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks realised that they possessed little brainpower but were far more capable than his robots, and that mimicking animal biology was smarter than trying to control every aspect of a robot’s behaviour through code. His successes led him to predict robots “everywhere in our world.”At 70, the former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world. But Brooks, who has spent his career making intelligent machines a part of everyday life, finds himself playing the skeptic.Today’s entrepreneurs promise robots that not only look human — or human-ish — but can also do everything a person can. Tech investors are pouring billions into the effort, but Brooks argues that general-purpose humanoid robots will not be coming home soon, and that they are not safe enough to be around humans.In Sept, he delivered a takedown in an essay that concluded that over the next 15 years, “a lot of money will have disappeared, spent on trying to squeeze performance, any performance, from today’s humanoid robots. But those robots will be long gone and mostly conveniently forgotten.”His blog post kicked off a furore in the small world of robotics. This was a legend in the field, whose insights had informed the humanoid craze.“At least a dozen people asked me if I agreed with it shortly after it went live (I don’t),” wrote Chris Paxton, a researcher in AI and robotics.Brooks remembers German technologist Ernst Dickmanns’ self-driving car, which began motoring across Europe in 1987. He was around when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and when AI researcher Geoff Hinton predicted in 2016 that radiology would be obsolete in five years because machine learning software could do it better. All of these were important developments, but drivers, chess players and radiologists are still among us.Brooks insists he is simply being practical. “We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he said in an interview.The physical appearance of a robot, Brooks likes to say, makes a promise about what it can do. Robots in wide use today are designed for specific jobs in specific situations, and look like it — an arm that does the same repetitive action on a manufacturing line, or the automated pallet movers in Amazon warehouses. They aren’t flashy. “People see the humanoid form,” he said, “and they think it’s going to be able to do everything a human can. ”Brooks said he wouldn’t get within three feet of a humanoid bot. If — when, he says — they lose balance, the powerful mechanics that make them useful make them dangerous.The current humanoid craze is “kind of his fault,” said Anthony Jules, Brooks’ co-founder and CEO at Robust.AI, which is building automated carts for distribution centres. Jules was an MIT undergrad in the 1990s when Brooks was leading the school’s Computer Science and AI Laboratory — helping create the algorithms behind today’s autonomous cars, pioneering the feedback loops that link AI and robotics.Brooks, who grew up in Australia, arrived at Adelaide’s Flinders University in 1972 at the same time as academic refugees fleeing the end of the Prague Spring, allowing him to receive a “classical Eastern European mathematics education.” He spent 12 hours each Sunday futzing around with the university’s only mainframe computer. He cofounded his first AI startup in 1984 while teaching at Stanford.Brooks is particularly skeptical that neural networks are ready to solve the dexterity problem. Humans don’t have a language for gathering, storing and communicating data about touch. In his view, the visual data preferred by the new guard of robot startups simply won’t be able to re-create what we can do with our fingers.“My students have built lots of hands, my students have built lots of arms, shipped tens of thousands of robot arms,” Brooks said. “I’m very convinced that humanoid robots are not going to have human-level manipulation.”Brooks would say he is a realist, not a pessimist. His main worry is that too much focus on the trendiest training techniques will leave other promising ideas neglected. He expects that robots will someday work alongside people, and that we may even refer to them as humanoid — but they will be on wheels, he says, and have multiple arms and probably won’t be general purpose.He works above the mock-up warehouse in San Carlos, California, where Robust’s robots learn their trade, but he expects to retire in the next few years. Then, Brooks plan to write a book about the nature of intelligence, and why humans won’t create it artificially for another 300 years.","Former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world.

How the shooting unfolded





At least two people were killed and eight others critically injured after a shooting at Brown University, Rhode Island on Saturday, police said, as officers rushed to the campus and searched for the suspect.Officials said the gunman, who is still being searched for, was dressed in black. Authorities initially reported that a suspect was in custody but later clarified that no arrests had been made.""I can confirm that there are two individuals who have died this afternoon, and there are another eight in critical status,"" Providence, Rhode Island Mayor Brett Smiley told a news conference.US president Donald Trump reacted to the shooting on Truth Social, saying, ""I have been briefed on the shooting that took place at Brown University in Rhode Island. The FBI is on the scene. The suspect is in custody. God bless the victims and the families of the victims!""At around 4:15 pm, Brown University sent an alert asking everyone on campus to lock doors, silence phones, and stay hidden until further notice.The initial alert also warned: “As a last resort, take action to protect yourself.” Authorities continued to urge people to shelter in place.Engineering design exams were underway there when the shooting occurred.Ansel Edison, an 18-year-old freshman, was on the ground floor of the science library when he saw a large number of police vehicles arrive.Students began rushing in from the engineering building. ""A panicked student came in and said there had been 20 shots fired,"" Edison said.Alex Bruce, a senior biochemistry student at Brown, told AP, he was working on his final research project in his dorm across the street when he heard sirens and received a text alert about an active shooter shortly after 4 pm.“‘I’m just sitting here shaking,’ he said, watching through the window as about half a dozen armed officers in tactical gear surrounded his dorm.

Indian-origin semi driver Kamalpreet Singh, believed to be an illegal immigrant, staying in the US without any valid documentation, was released on bond after he was charged with vehicular homicide. The bond amount was set at $100,000. A major outrage started against Indian-origin drivers behind the wheel in the US, taking lives recklessly and then walking free.29-year-old Robert B Pearson was killed as his car was crushed between two trucks on SR 167. Troopers said three vehicles were traveling in lane one when two of them stopped for traffic and a third failed to slow in time. A 2020 Freightliner Cascadia semi driven by 25-year-old Kamalpreet Singh of Elk Grove, California, struck the rear of a blue 2010 Mazda 3 sedan that had stopped behind a white 2016 Peterbilt truck. The Freightliner overrode the back of the Mazda and pushed it under the rear of the Peterbilt.The engine of Robert's car caught fire and he died at the scene. Singh and the Peterbilt driver were not injured. All three drivers were wearing seat belts. The collision blocked the roadway for 6 hours and 48 minutes. The State Patrol said drugs and alcohol were not involved, and the cause of the collision remains under investigation.""My brother was the one killed.

He crossed the border illegally in 2023 and was released into the US.Troopers determined Singh made no attempt to brake or take evasive action before striking the stopped vehicles. Singh falsified his electronic logbook by listing a co-driver and including data that investigators said could indicate the logbook was altered or disconnected.Social media users reacted sharply to his release and bond and questioned who could pay such an amount for an illegal immigrant. ""Of course he was.. because illegals can just come up with $100K. How is that?"" one wrote.""Where did he get bond money? Who issued his license? Who hired him? Who verified his legal status?

When JD Vance said H-1B didn't make any sense to him





Vice President JD Vance reacted to the new H-1B row as states now challenge the Donald Trump administration's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, and said the states can instead try hiring Americans. Vance was reacting to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield's social media post on suing the new fee, calling it illegal. Dan Rayfield said the new fee would create a costly barrier for employers, especially public sector and government employers who can't pay such a fee if they want to hire from outside.""You might try hiring Americans,"" the vice president posted, giving a solution to the H-1B problem Dan Rayfield raised.""This is instructive, though. While I know there are many people in our coalition who--rightly--are angry about immigration fraud in our visa system, America Last Republicans and Democrats are teaming up to stop our efforts to address these issues. Don't black pill. Fight back,"" JD Vance said.California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Nevada are the 20 states challenging the H-1B visa fee.""The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including Oregon, where the flagship universities consistently depend on H-1B visa holders to fill faculty, researcher, and staff roles. For example, Oregon State University currently sponsors more than 150 H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff, and intends to hire additional faculty, researchers, and staff through the H-1B program. Eliminating access to H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff would inflict significant institutional harm, depriving students of critical educational opportunities,"" Dan Rayfield said.Rayfield said the University of Oregon sponsors more than 50 H-1B faculty, researchers and staff. An initial H-1B petition takes between $960 to $7,595 in regulatory and statutory fees. ""The Trump Administration’s $100,000 fee far exceeds the actual cost of processing H-1B petitions. By imposing this fee, the Administration is exceeding the fee-setting authority granted by Congress, which requires that fees be set based on the agency’s costs, rather than arbitrarily,"" Rayfield said.JD Vance is known for his strong stand against H-1B. Recently, he rapped tech companies for laying off Americans and hiring foreigners. He said it did not make any sense to him. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me. That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.'

What actually happened

A phrase with a long and ugly history

Intent versus impact is not an equal debate

Corporate responses and unresolved questions

Why this was never just about a joke





When a single-line reply under a hackathon photo set off a storm on X, many outside the Indian and South Asian tech community initially dismissed the reaction as overblown. The phrase was short, vague and, to some, easily explained away as a crude joke about long hours and crowded rooms. But for many Indians in tech, the comment landed very differently. It touched a nerve shaped by years of stereotypes, coded insults and experiences that make certain words anything but neutral.The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers. In response, Nik Pash, Cline’s head of AI, replied with the phrase “imagine the smell.” Almost immediately, Indian and South Asian users pointed out that the phrase is widely recognised online as a racist meme aimed at their community.As criticism mounted, Pash defended the remark as a harmless joke about hackathons and refused to apologise. “I’m not going to apologise for making a harmless joke about hackathons smelling bad,” he wrote, adding that he had attended several such events that year and that “they all smelled bad.”That stance intensified the backlash. Prominent voices in the tech ecosystem stepped in to explain publicly why the phrase carried racial meaning regardless of intent. Deedy Das, an Indian-origin tech investor, put it bluntly: “Every time I’ve seen ‘imagine the smell’, it’s an attack on Indians.” His point, echoed by many others, was not about reading malice into every joke, but about recognising how certain phrases function online.The discussion escalated rapidly, alongside legitimate criticism, there were also instances of harassment and threats, which many critics condemned outright. Only after sustained public pressure did Saoud Rizwan, the founder and chief executive of Cline, issue a statement. He distanced the company from the comment and acknowledged that harm had been caused, while emphasising that the remark was not intended to offend.The reaction was not driven by hypersensitivity to humour. “Imagine the smell” is widely recognised online as a racist meme used to mock Indians and South Asians, particularly in tech and gaming spaces. For years, the phrase has circulated alongside stereotypes about hygiene, food and overcrowding, often functioning as a way to demean Indian professionals while preserving plausible deniability.One of the most persistent tropes behind it is the idea that Indians “smell like curry”, a stereotype that has followed South Asians for decades across schools, workplaces and popular culture. From playground taunts to office jokes and anonymous comment sections, food, spices and bodies are collapsed into a single insult, implying uncleanliness and otherness. Indian media commentary has repeatedly traced this trope to colonial-era attitudes that used hygiene and bodily difference as tools of racial hierarchy.Online forums make clear how common the association remains. Indian and South Asian users frequently describe encountering comments such as “smells like curry” or “imagine the smell” under unrelated photos or videos, often accompanied by emoji reactions meant to signal mockery rather than humour. The phrasing survives precisely because it allows users to retreat behind irony or alleged ambiguity when challenged.Because of that history, intent becomes secondary. When language is repeatedly used to target a specific group, it carries meaning even when the speaker claims a different context. For many Indians, the words do not arrive as a blank slate. They arrive loaded.Defenders of the comment focused heavily on intent, arguing that because it was not meant to be racist, it should not be treated as such. But this framing misunderstands how harm operates. Impact is shaped by repetition, power and context, not by a single explanation offered after the fact.For Indians in tech, the impact is cumulative. It is built from schoolyard taunts, online slurs, workplace jokes and the constant pressure to laugh along to avoid being labelled humourless or difficult. Viewed through this lens, the comment did not exist in isolation. It fit a familiar pattern.Calling out the phrase was not about punishing an individual. It was about naming a problem that is often minimised or ignored. Several Indian voices made the same point publicly: even if the comment was not intended as anti-India, its effect was indistinguishable from comments that clearly are.Cline’s response reflected a familiar corporate dilemma. Companies often move quickly to manage reputational fallout, but rarely go far enough in confronting the cultural assumptions that make such incidents possible. For many Indian professionals, the lingering question is not whether a statement was issued, but whether genuine understanding followed.Will future humour be filtered through an awareness of historical harm, or will each episode be treated as an isolated misunderstanding?At its core, the controversy was not about policing humour or enforcing ideological conformity. It was about who gets to define harm. Indians in tech are frequently cited as evidence of diversity and meritocracy, yet their experiences are often discounted when they articulate discomfort.For many Indians, the phrase was never neutral because lived experience has taught them it rarely is. This does not mean every careless comment is malicious. It does mean that dismissing the reaction as oversensitivity ignores the way words accumulate meaning over time.The lesson from this episode is not that humour should vanish from tech culture. It is that context matters, history matters and listening matters. When those are ignored, even a few words can reveal far more than the speaker intended.","The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers.

Trump says 'will retaliate'

.





Two US service members and one American civilian were killed, and three other US troops injured, in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman in central Syria on Saturday, US Central Command said.In a post on X, CENTCOM, an American military arm that looks after operations in the Middle East, said the Americans were targeted during a visit by US forces near the historic town of Palmyra.“Two US service members and one US civilian were killed, and three service members were injured, as a result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria. The gunman was engaged and killed,” the statement said.The attack marks the first incident to cause US casualties in Syria since the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad a year ago. CENTCOM said the identities of the deceased service members would be withheld for 24 hours, in line with Department of War policy, until their next of kin are notified.Syrian state media SANA reported that shots were fired at Syrian and American forces, wounding several people. The injured were evacuated by helicopter to the US-run al-Tanf garrison near the Syria-Iraq-Jordan border. SANA said the attacker was killed, without giving further details.A US defence official told the Ap that authorities were aware of the incident but had no immediate information to provide. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least three Syrian security personnel were also wounded, offering a differing account of the attacker’s identity.The US maintains hundreds of troops in eastern and central Syria as part of an international coalition fighting IS. Though the group was territorially defeated in 2019, the united nations estimates it still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters operating in Syria and Iraq through sleeper cells.US troops stationed at locations including al-Tanf have been targeted in the past. One of the deadliest such attacks occurred in 2019 in Manbij, when a bombing killed two US service members and two American civilians during a patrol.US President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed “very serious retaliation” after the attack in Syria.Taking to Truth Social, the US president said, ""We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria, two soldiers, and one Civilian Interpreter. Likewise, we pray for the three injured soldiers who, it has just been confirmed, are doing well. This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them. The President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is extremely angry and disturbed by this attack. There will be very serious retaliation. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""","Two US service members and one American civilian were killed, and three other US troops injured, in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman in central Syria on Saturday.

Social media vetting from December 15





As the State Department begins social media vetting of all visa applicants, primarily H-1B, H-4 but also students and other non-immigrant visas, immigration lawyer Brad Bernstein explained that now there is unlikely to be any instant visa approval and immigration officials will go through all social media profiles of a candidate -- looking for contradictions. If the social media profiles are locked, then there are chances that the visa request will be instantly canceled.Bernstein explained that immigration officials have been asked to check Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Snapchat, but the scrutiny may not remain limited to these popular social media platforms. They may check any resume posted on the Internet, any blog in your name or a YouTube comment -- practically anything that comes up on the Internet on the applicant's name.The lawyer advised that applicants must fix any contradictions in their online profiles before the visa interview, after they make them public. They should also Google themselves to check what all comes up when their name is searched. ""They’re looking for inconsistencies, signs of immigrant intent that you may want to stay in the US looking for a Green Card, hostile statements about the United States, support for extremist groups, questionable work history, or signs that posts were deleted after filing,"" the lawyer said.""If your visa form says you are a full-time engineering student, but your LinkedIn shows freelance work or you are driving an Uber, now you have a credibility issue. You made a post somewhere or a comment: 'I can't wait to live in America forever', now you have an immigrant intent,"" Bernstein said, adding that applicants should not delete anything after filing as it would make things worse.Consular offices have been asked to go through the social media accounts of the visa applicants starting from December 15.

As 20 states sued the Donald Trump administration for its $100k fee on H-1B visa, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his strong anti-immigration stand, said these lawsuits will not hold water as President Donald Trump deserves all the credit to be the first president who took action against companies for using low-wage labors. Miller said President Trump has all the authority to decide who gets to enter the US and he blew off the lid of a whole model where tech companies fire Americans who train low-wage foreigners. Referring to the third-party companies that hire Indians for IT roles in the US as bodyshops, a known phrase in the industry, Miller said that these bodyshops are run by Americans in the middle of their career. They meet the CEOs of IT companies and then fire Americans after they train their low-wage replacements, Miller said, adding that the president has the right to decide who would enter the country and who won't.The Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas so that companies do not hire foreigners in bulk and only high-skilled employees are hired. But President Trump asserted that he won't abolish the H-1B program as there are certain talents that need to be hired from foreign countries. “If hospitals and clinics must either pay an extra $100,000 per doctor to leave positions unfilled, the consequences are clear: fewer providers, longer wait times, reduced access to care and growing health disparities,” Bonta said.The visa fee triggered a major controversy and now 20 states have sued the administration claiming that the Trump administrations does not have the power or legal authorty to rewrite immigration law. “No president can ignore the co-equal branch of government of Congress, ignore the Constitution or ignore the law,” California attorney general Rob Bonta said.The lawsuit says the Department of Homeland Security skipped the required notice-and-comment procedures where a proposal is put out for the public to comment before it becomes a rule.","The Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas so that companies do not hire foreigners in bulk and only high-skilled employees are hired.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





A coalition of 20 US states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, claiming the policy exceeds presidential authority and threatens US labor markets and critical services.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and spearheaded by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, argues that the fee far surpasses what federal law allows and was implemented without proper legal procedures. Traditionally, employers pay between roughly $960 and $7,600 in combined regulatory and statutory fees for H-1B petitions; the new six-figure surcharge represents an unprecedented jump.Democratic officials contend that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacked authority to impose such a steep fee without congressional approval and bypassed required notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act. They assert that the fee will dampen employers’ ability to hire skilled foreign professionals US industries rely on — particularly in tech, healthcare, research and education.State attorneys general emphasized the practical impacts of the rule, warning that schools, universities, hospitals and research institutions could struggle to fill specialized positions. Maryland’s AG noted teacher and researcher shortages, while Oregon and Vermont officials highlighted risks to local economies and public services that depend on H-1B workers, some 70 percent of whom are from India. Proponents of the fee say it is intended to curb perceived abuses of the H-1B system and protect US jobs. But Democratic critics counter that the policy will worsen labor shortages in critical sectors and undercut US competitiveness in science and technology.The states’ lawsuit adds to a broader legal and political battle over the H-1B system. In October, the US Chamber of Commerce and several industry groups also filed separate lawsuits alleging the fee is unlawful and threatens business investment and innovation.With hearings expected in coming weeks, the case is shaping up as a key test of executive authority over immigration policy — and of broader tensions between efforts to protect domestic labor and needs of a globalized economy reliant on high-skilled talent.","20 US states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications.

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians





A group of Democratic-party senators including Alex Padilla, member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Sub-committee; Jacky Rosen and several others, have moved a resolution to reverse an ‘interim final rule’ recently issued by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This rule, which came into force from Oct 30, ended automatic renewals of work permits for certain categories of legally authorised non-citizens including spouses of H-1B visa holders.As reported earlier by TOI, it meant that nearly a lakh Indian spouses (largely women) who held employment authorisation documents (EADs) would no longer be able to continue to work after their current EAD expired. They would need to wait until the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved and renewed their EAD. The hitch: H-4 EAD holders can file renewal applications only up to 180 days before the expiration date, but USCIS typically takes a longer time to process the application. These senators point out that the interim final rule would impact nearly 87% of all pending renewals causing immense hardship.Prior to this amendment, an auto-extension of the EAD of up to 540 days was available. Thus, those who filed renewal applications on time could continue working while their applications were pending, a safeguard designed to prevent job losses caused by bureaucratic delays.With the safeguard withdrawn, many individuals face the prospect of losing their livelihoods simply because their renewals are stuck in processing queues that often stretch for months.This group of US senators have moved the resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) – it enables a federal agency rule to be quickly overturned by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within a limited time after the rule is issued. Legal experts explain that generally a resolution under the CRA requires the President to sign off. But, Congress can attempt to override the President’s veto with a super-majority vote.By using the CRA, these senators are attempting a fast-track legislative reversal that would not only restore automatic extensions but also prevent the Trump administration from reintroducing a similar rule in the future without explicit Congressional approval.All hopes of those impacted are pinned on this resolution. “Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s campaign to marginalize noncitizens working here legally is disrupting our entire national economy and devastating employers who rely on their contributions,” said Senator Padilla. “The administration’s self-defeating rule to deny automatic work permit extensions would force people who have already been vetted to lose their ability to keep working, causing unnecessary strain for immigrants and employers alike. People who have already been screened and authorized to work should be able to keep working, plain and simple.” Several immigration attorneys told TOI that the DHS rule could also face court challenges, particularly as it was issued without a prior public consultation process.","A group of Democratic-party senators have moved a resolution to reverse an ‘interim final rule’ recently issued by the US Department of Homeland Security.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones.

Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

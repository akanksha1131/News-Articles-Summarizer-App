Iran on Sunday launched a new wave of missile attacks against Israel, prompting Tel Aviv to retaliate with airstrikes on Tehran. According to AFP, at least 14 people were injured when an Iranian missile struck a residential building in Israel, as confirmed by first responders.The Israeli military on Saturday reported that Iran had launched a new barrage of missiles toward its territory, triggering nationwide alerts and immediate public safety measures.“A short while ago, the IDF (military) identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel.

Sirens were reported in multiple parts of Israel as tensions surged.Missile sirens and explosions echoed across several areas of Israel, including Tel Aviv, as Iranian state television confirmed it had launched a new wave of attacks.This latest escalation came just a day after Israel’s high-intensity assault on Iranian military and nuclear sites, which appears to have triggered the current retaliation.Israel's Fire and Rescue Services confirmed that several residential buildings in the country's coastal and northern regions were hit in the attacks. Fires broke out in open areas as a result of the impact.“Several incidents have been reported to the Israel Fire and Rescue Services command centres in the Coastal and Northern Districts, with hits on residential buildings and a fire in an open area,” spokesperson Tal Volbovitz said.In response to the Israeli airstrikes, Iran activated its air defence systems across multiple regions. The escalating attacks marked one of the most intense direct confrontations between the two regional powers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to target “every target of the ayatollah regime,” while Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that “further strikes would draw a more severe and powerful response.”Hours after the initial wave of missile threats, the Israeli army eased the emergency alert, stating that citizens could leave shelters but should remain cautious.“Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country and to remain near them,” the military said.","Iran on Sunday launched a new wave of missile attacks against Israel, prompting Tel Aviv to retaliate with airstrikes on Tehran.

'Tehran is burning'







A day after the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic struck the IDF's military base in Tel Aviv, Israel launched a major counteroffensive on Sunday, directly targeting Tehran’s defence and energy infrastructure in a sharp escalation of hostilities between the two arch-rivals.IDF also hit Iranian Shahran oil facility in its latest series of attacks.In response, Iran fired a fresh wave of missiles into Israeli territory, killing four people and injuring several others in the northern Galilee region.The strikes come just days after Israel’s surprise launch of ""Operation Rising Lion,"" targeting Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz. Sunday’s attacks marked the most major Israeli action yet, with targets including Iran’s ministry of defence headquarters and the SPND -- an agency Israel claims is central to Iran’s nuclear weapons development.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, stating: “The IDF completed an extensive series of strikes on targets in Tehran related to the Iranian regime’s nuclear weapons project… including the Iranian Ministry of Defence, SPND nuclear project headquarters, and additional sites where the regime hid its nuclear archive.”Loud explosions were reported across eastern and western Tehran late Sunday, with visuals showing heavy smoke billowing over the city skyline.Iranian state media confirmed several areas were hit, but did not release casualty figures immediately.Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said the missiles were aimed at facilities involved in the production of fuel for Israeli fighter jets. ""If Israeli aggression continues, Iran will respond with further missile strikes,"" the Guard said in a statement.The latest developments come just hours after Iran’s Friday night retaliation for the Natanz strike, when it targeted Israel’s heavily fortified Kirya compound in Tel Aviv -- the nerve centre of Israel’s military command and home to its ministry of defence and intelligence units.Israel's Fire and Rescue Services confirmed that multiple residential buildings in the coastal and northern regions were struck during the attacks, sparking fires in open areas. ""Several incidents have been reported to our command centres in the Coastal and Northern Districts, including direct hits on homes and a blaze in an open area,"" said spokesperson Tal Volbovitz.IDF stated, “Iran made its intentions clear — we had no choice but to respond.As Iran advances toward nuclear weapons and continues targeting innocent civilians, the IDF is acting to defend Israel and confront a threat the world cannot afford to overlook.”Adding to global concern, indirect nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States -- scheduled to resume on Sunday -- were abruptly cancelled. Mediator Oman confirmed the cancellation, with a senior US official saying, “We remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will return to the table soon.”World leaders called for urgent de-escalation. China’s foreign minister warned that strikes on nuclear facilities set a ""dangerous precedent,"" while diplomats across Europe expressed concern over a wider regional conflict.Israel claims its two-day offensive has eliminated nine top Iranian nuclear scientists and a number of senior generals.

A senior Israeli official has indicated that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could become a direct target, as Israel intensifies its campaign against Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the unnamed official said assassination of Iran’s top leader is ""not off limits,"" underlining a dramatic escalation in Israel’s strategic posture.The statement signals a shift from solely targeting Iran’s nuclear program to potentially dismantling the regime’s leadership structure.The official claimed that Israel’s recent strikes have already inflicted substantial damage, including at the heavily fortified Natanz enrichment facility, where structural collapse was reported. Israel has also taken responsibility for the assassinations of nine nuclear scientists and several high-ranking military officers in recent months.Additional strikes are expected soon, as part of the ongoing Israeli offensive known as 'Operation Rising Lion'.

At least 100 people were killed in a brutal overnight attack by gunmen in Nigeria’s north-central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said Saturday. The massacre occurred between late Friday and the early hours of Saturday in the village of Yelewata, located in the Guma region of the state.The rights group, in a Facebook post, described the attack as one of the deadliest in recent months, saying ""many families were locked up and burnt inside their bedrooms. So many bodies were burnt beyond recognition.""Amnesty also reported that dozens of people remain missing, and hundreds have been left wounded, many without access to medical care. Shocking images and videos circulating on social media showed charred buildings, scorched bodies, and widespread destruction in the community.Udeme Edet, spokesperson for the Benue state police, confirmed that an attack had occurred in Yelewata but did not provide casualty figures. “We are still assessing the situation on ground,” Edet said.Authorities have not identified those responsible for the killings. However, violence between herders and farmers is a persistent issue in Nigeria’s Middle Belt region, often leading to deadly confrontations over land and water rights.Such attacks are frequently blamed on Fulani herders, who graze cattle across traditional farming areas. Local farmers accuse them of destroying crops and forcibly occupying farmlands, while herders argue they are following legally designated grazing routes established under a 1965 law.The region has witnessed similar bloodshed in recent months. In May, at least 20 people were killed in Benue’s Gwer West area in an attack suspected to have been carried out by herders. In April, at least 40 people died in violence in neighbouring Plateau state.Benue State Governor Hyacinth Alia has dispatched a delegation to Yelewata to support the grieving families. “This act of terror is deeply heartbreaking. We are committed to ensuring those responsible are brought to justice,” a spokesperson from the governor’s office said.Benue, often referred to as the “food basket of the nation,” has been a flashpoint for herder-farmer clashes in recent years, contributing to a broader insecurity crisis that has gripped Nigeria’s northern and central states.(With inputs from agencies)","Amnesty International Nigeria says at least 100 people were killed in a brutal overnight attack by gunmen in Nigeria’s north-central Benue state.

DUBAI: Israel's defence minister warned Saturday that ""Tehran will burn"" if Iran continues firing missiles, as the countries traded blows a day after Israel launched a blistering surprise attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, killing several top generals.The attacks have left Iran's surviving leadership with the difficult decision of plunging deeper into conflict with Israel's more powerful forces or seeking a diplomatic route. Israel - which is widely believed to have a nuclear weapons programme - said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days also killed nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear programme.Iran's UN ambassador said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded.Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook buildings. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by the war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. Health officials said three people were killed and dozens wounded. Defence minister Israel Katz said Iran will pay a heavy price for harming Israeli citizens.""If (Iran Supreme leader) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front - Tehran will burn,"" Katz said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that his objective was to eliminate any Iranian threat to Israel, but he also urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders.The US and Iran were scheduled to be in Oman on Sunday for their sixth round of indirect talks over Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's top diplomat said Saturday the talks were ""unjustifiable"" after the Israeli strikes, likely signalling no negotiations this weekend. But he stopped short of saying the talks were cancelled.Iran launched waves of missiles at Israel late Friday and early Saturday, and Iranians awoke to state television airing repeated clips of strikes on Israel, as well as videos of people cheering and handing out sweets. The Iranian attacks killed at least three people and wounded 76, mostly in and around Tel Aviv, according to two local hospitals. One missile severely damaged at least four homes in the nearby city of Rishon Lezion, according to first responders.The Israeli military said seven soldiers were lightly wounded when a missile hit central Israel, without specifying where. It was the first report of Israeli military casualties since the initial Israeli strikes.US ground-based air defence systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an Associated Press journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one whose front was nearly entirely torn away. Residents of a central Israeli city that was hit Friday night told the AP the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open.Israeli police said debris from the interception of drones and missiles fell in dozens of locations in northern Israel, causing damage and fires but no injuries.

Strong Compliance Reflects UAE’s Humanitarian Values

Poll Do you support the Midday Work Ban in the UAE? Yes, it's essential for worker safety. No, it disrupts work schedules.

Exceptions, Monitoring, and Penalties





Starting Sunday, June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization (MoHRE) will enforce the Midday Work Ban, a regulation prohibiting outdoor work under direct sunlight between 12:30 PM and 3:00 PM. This ban, which continues through September 15, aims to prevent heat-related illnesses and injuries during the hottest months of the year.The Ministry’s website highlights that this marks the 21st consecutive year of the ban’s implementation, underscoring the UAE’s commitment to global occupational health and safety standards. The initiative is a crucial part of creating safer work environments across the country during summer’s peak heat.According to Mohsen Al Nassi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Inspection and Compliance Sector at MoHRE:“The Midday Work Ban has achieved an outstanding compliance rate of over 99% for consecutive years, which highlights the deep-rooted social and humanitarian values within the UAE’s business community and private sector. It also reflects an advanced level of awareness regarding the importance of safeguarding human capital, which is a company’s most valuable asset.Moreover, it underscores the humane and progressive nature of UAE labour laws, particularly in relation to occupational safety and health. ”Similarly, Dalal Al Shehhi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for the Labor Protection Sector, pointed out that:“The Midday Work Ban has become a leading example of partnership between the Ministry, the private sector, and members of the community. This is reflected in the way partners have developed initiatives for workers during the ban period, thereby promoting the concept of social responsibility and highlighting the success of awareness strategies and the entrenchment of humanitarian values in the UAE’s work environment. ”The UAE, home to more than 200 nationalities, continues to align this regulation with the broader “We the UAE 2031” vision, fostering a thriving and inclusive society.MoHRE conducts regular field inspections at worksites and workers’ accommodations to raise awareness and enforce compliance with the ban. These visits help prevent heat exhaustion and sunstroke by reinforcing the importance of adhering to safety standards.Many private companies support this initiative by providing fully equipped rest areas during the banned hours. These spaces include shaded areas, fans, sufficient drinking water, hydrating salts approved by local authorities, and first aid kits. Such measures ensure workers can rest and recover safely before resuming their duties.The ban allows exceptions for critical work that cannot be paused, such as asphalt laying, concrete pouring, and emergency repairs affecting utilities or traffic. However, these activities require authorization from relevant government authorities and must be completed promptly.To ensure strict compliance, MoHRE encourages public reporting of violations through its call centre (600590000), official website, and mobile app. Companies violating the ban face fines of AED 5,000 per offending worker, with a maximum fine of AED 50,000 for multiple violations.MoHRE continues to strengthen awareness campaigns and inspections in collaboration with both public and private sectors to maintain a safe and healthy work environment during the summer months.","UAE enforces Midday Work Ban from June 15 to September 15, banning outdoor work from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, with 99% compliance and fines up to AED 50,000.

Iran launched a powerful retaliatory strike late Friday night, targeting one of Israel's most heavily guarded military sites, the Kirya compound in Tel Aviv, following Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz.The Kirya, often referred to as Israel's version of the Pentagon, houses the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) general staff, the ministry of defence, and critical military command and intelligence units.It also includes Camp Rabin, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and is considered vital for Israel’s national security operations.According to reports, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the Tel Aviv-based military complex, striking deep into Israel's defence infrastructure.Israel's well-known Iron Dome air defence system failed to stop the targeted attack launched by the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic.Also read: ‘Talks with US meaningless’: Iran rules out nuclear talks; Tehran blames US for backing Israel The New York Times verified alarming social media footage showing a missile slamming into the area, causing what was described as ""significant damage.""""This is Israel’s version of the Pentagon, the Kiryat, and the building on this compound was just hit,"" Fox News reported.""There is significant damage.""The dramatic videos showed Israel’s air defence systems firing interceptors into the night sky moments before a large explosion lit up central Tel Aviv.

Poll Should international bodies play a more active role in de-escalating regional military conflicts? Yes, stronger global intervention is needed. No, such matters should be handled internally.





In a bid to fill the military vacuum left by Israel’s fatal strikes that killed several top Iranian commanders, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday appointed Major General Amir Hatami as the new Chief Commander of the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The announcement, reported by Iranian state media outlet IRNA, marks a significant leadership change as Tehran seeks to stabilise its military structure after Israel’s large-scale offensive.Hatami, who served as Iran's Defence Minister from 2013 to 2021, now steps into a critical role at a time of heightened regional tensions.In his official decree, Khamenei commended Hatami's ""dedication, competence, and experience,"" urging him to lead with a ""transformative and revolutionary approach,"" according to IRNA.Khamenei also expressed gratitude to Major General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi for his ""sincere and valuable efforts"" during his tenure.The reshuffle follows the killing of Iran's former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CSAF) General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, who, according to Iranian authorities, was assassinated ""at the hands of the evil Zionist regime."" Khamenei later appointed Mousavi as Bagheri’s successor.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri at the hands of the evil Zionist regime, & in light of Major General Sayyid Abdolrahim Mousavi's meritorious services & valuable experience, I appoint him as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces,” Khamenei posted on X.Khamenei also made sweeping changes across other key military branches, replacing top officials killed in Israel’s Operation Rising Lion airstrikes.Major General Mohammad Pakpour has been named the new Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the death of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami in the Israeli strikes.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Mohammad Pakpour's meritorious services and valuable experience, I appoint him as Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” Khamenei announced.Further, Major General Ali Shadmani was appointed Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central Headquarters, following the assassination of Lieutenant General Gholamali Rashid. Khamenei posted, “In view of Lt. Gen. Gholamali Rashid's martyrdom at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Ali Shadmani's meritorious services & valuable experience, I confer the rank of Major Gen. & appoint him Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central HQ. ”According to a CNN report, Israel’s Operation Rising Lion dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s top military leadership, killing high-ranking officers, including the heads of the IRGC, the air force, and a former national security chief.Among the key figures killed was Major General Hossein Salami, the powerful commander of the IRGC who had led the elite force since 2019. Salami played a pivotal role in Iran’s military offensives, including direct missile and drone attacks on Israel in April and October 2024.CNN further reported that Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, was another significant casualty. Bagheri was instrumental in military coordination, foreign policy engagements in Syria, and diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia.Ali Shamkhani, a long-time aide to Khamenei and former national security chief, also died in the Israeli strike. Shamkhani had recently been involved in Iran’s diplomatic overtures, including China-brokered talks with Saudi Arabia.Also read: Explainer: How Iran's nuclear progress triggered Israeli strike - and why it matters Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC’s air force and the strategist behind Iran’s 2020 missile attacks on Israel and US military bases in Iraq, was also killed.

The type of radiation present inside the facility, primarily alpha particles, is manageable with appropriate radiation protection measures,"" he said in his statement.Grossi revealed that the Israeli strikes destroyed the above-ground section of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, which was enriching uranium up to 60 per cent U-235. The attack also damaged electrical infrastructure, including both main and emergency power systems.Although the underground cascade hall appears undamaged, the loss of power may have affected the centrifuges inside.Iran informed the agency that only the Natanz site was directly hit, which includes the Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant.However, Iran also reported nearby attacks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Esfahan complex, which houses several other nuclear facilities.The IAEA is in constant contact with Iran’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority to monitor the situation and assess the damage, said Grossi. A special task force has been established to monitor developments and update the UN Security Council as needed.Grossi expressed deep concern over the Israeli attack, reiterating that “nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances.”Following the strikes, Israel said that Iran was closer than ever to developing a nuclear weapon and described the attack as a necessary act of defence.

Poll Do you think diplomatic efforts can help reduce conflicts between countries? Yes, diplomacy is key to peace No, conflicts often escalate despite talks





The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Saturday apologised to Indians on X for sharing a post that depicted an incorrect map of India.The IDF acknowledged the mistake and clarified that the post was intended as an illustration of the region.“This map fails to precisely depict borders. We apologise for any offense caused by this image,” the IDF wrote on X.The image, shared with the caption, “Iran is a global threat. Israel is not the end goal, it’s only the beginning. We had no other choice but to act,” visually illustrated the range of Iran’s missiles. The map placed Iran at the centre, with concentric circles marking missile ranges of 300 km, 500 km, 800 km, 1,300 km, and 2,000 km, extending the threat to countries across the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and parts of Europe and Asia.The graphic was intended to emphasise that Iran’s missile capabilities are not just a threat to Israel but pose a wider regional and potentially global danger.However, a major flaw in the image was the incorrect depiction of India’s map. The map omitted Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, which are constitutionally integral parts of India. Aksai Chin, which is part of Ladakh, was also excluded from Indian territory. Arunachal Pradesh was also misrepresented in the map.Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply overnight as Iran launched missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and into early Saturday, in retaliation for Israel’s Operation ""Rising Lion.""The confrontation erupted after what Israeli officials described as the country’s ""greatest military operations in history"" against Iran.

Iran Missile Strike Near Tel Aviv Causes Casualties; 2 Killed, Over A Dozen Injured In Central Israel

Point of no return: Army chief





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Friday said the attacks were authorised over six months ago, in November 2024, and was initially scheduled for April 2025, but were postponed due to operational considerations. In a recorded speech in Hebrew, Netanyahu provided updates about the operation to citizens. A visibly elated Netanyahu said he will try to make such statements daily.""This didn't happen by chance or for trivial reasons - if Iran has nuclear weapons, we simply won't be here,"" he said. Netanyahu said that following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel made an assessment that Iran would expedite its nuclear programme, which it did. Earlier on Friday morning, in a video message, he said Iran has reached a level of uranium enrichment that it could soon develop some nine atom bombs. He also cautioned citizens not to be in euphoria over the success of the operation and stay calm and vigilant. He asserted that there would be retaliation and may be ""a price"" to pay.Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"". ""We cannot wait for another time to act, we have no choice,"" Zamir said. ""History has taught us... to fight to preserve our existence"".","Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"".

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.

For four decades, Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a grand project: building up a network of anti-Israel militias known as the ""Axis of Resistance"" that would join Iran if a war with Israel broke out.Friday's strikes underscored just how degraded that axis has become over the past year, with few expecting those armed groups to meaningfully respond to the Israeli aggression, experts say. In the clearest sign of that weakened stance, Hezbollah , the Lebanese militant group seen as Iran's most powerful proxy, condemned the attack but stopped short of vowing military action in response - a notable omission from a group that has long served as the central pillar of the axis.The Houthis in Yemen also made no mention of responding militarily. ""The axis hasn't been fully destroyed, but it has been diminished beyond the point of return,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. ""It has been transformed into an axis of sitting ducks waiting for the next Israeli strikes rather than taking initiative and pushing Israel into the defence.""Iran also lost a key ally in Dec, after Syrian rebels, whom Hezbollah fought, toppled Bashar al-Assad's govt in Syria. Among Iran's proxies, still intact are Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and the Houthis. ""Now the Houthis are the most capable and forthcoming of the axis, but at the same time, (Israeli) strikes have had an impact on their capacity,"" said Ali.","Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a network of anti-Israel militias.

JERUSALEM: Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems during Israel’s attack on nuclear and military targets, an Israeli security source said, while another official said Israel used a ploy to suggest the strike was not imminent.The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into the attacks.Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday. Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran.Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes.M ossad even smuggled weapons into Iran. The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran. The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said were its operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.The decision to strike Iran was made Monday, the same day Netanyahu and Trump spoke, when Netanyahu, defence minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin Friday, said a second source.

How it all started?



How world leaders reacted?







Iran struck back at Israel with a second wave of missiles on Saturday in retaliation to the latter's Operation Rising Lion that killed over 78 people and left 320 injured, according to Iran's UN ambassador.In a stark warning to Israel, Iranian military shared a video of the strikes saying, ""When the last sword strikes, we’ll see who remains.""The Israeli military issued a brief alert urging residents to seek shelter following the detection of new missile launches from Iran. ""A short while ago, sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the State of Israel,"" the military said, adding that the air force was ""operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat"". Shortly after this, it announced that, based on a ""situational assessment,"" it was safe to leave shelters, though people were advised to stay close to them.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a recorded address to the nation, said, ""Do not assume that they attacked and it's finished. No, they initiated the actions and began the conflict. We will not permit them to evade consequences for this significant wrongdoing they have perpetrated"".Israel’s emergency medical services reported that 34 individuals were injured in the missile barrage targeting the Tel Aviv area.The conflict was sparked by what has been described as Israel’s largest military operation in history against Iran. Israeli warplanes and drones on Thursday night—some allegedly pre-positioned within Iranian territory—carried out a massive, coordinated assault deep inside the country.The attacks targeted critical sites, including components of Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile facilities, and military command centers. Several high-ranking Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists were reportedly killed in the strike.In retaliation, Iran on Friday night launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv.US President Donald Trump urged Iran to 'make a deal' saying, ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!""Meanwhile, Prime minister Narendra Modi called for restoration of peace in the region saying, ""Received a phone call from PM @netanyahu of Israel.

Escalation serves no one in the region. Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate.

20 top Iranian commanders killed in attacks: Reports





Iran was reeling on Friday from waves of Israeli strikes that decapitated its military chain of command and targeted a key nuclear facility, as US President Donald Trump urged Iran to strike a deal curbing its nuclear programme or risk ""even more brutal"" attacks.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the assault, which was brought about by deploying warplanes and drones smuggled into the country, as a last resort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, which Israel views as an existential threat. Israel said the strikes were only the start of 'Operation Rising Lion'. The attacks also killed several top Iranian officials and six nuclear scientists and hit Iran's long-range missile facilities and aerial defences.As evening fell, Iranian media reported explosions on the northern and southern outskirts of Tehran and at Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, a second major nuclear site. Israel's military said it was striking Iranian missile and drone launching sites. Air defences were activated across Tehran and explosions could be heard in Isfahan, with Israel claiming it had struck the nuke site there. Iran said in retaliation ""the gates of hell will open"".On Friday night, explosions were heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as sirens sounded across Israel following what the country's military spokesman said was the firing of missiles from Iran.Iran's state news agency IRNA said hundreds of ballistic missiles had been launched, shortly after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised ""harsh punishment"". There were no immediate reports of casualties.Friday's strikes were the first time Israel successfully hit Iran's nuke facilities, including its main enrichment facility at Natanz, which an Israeli military spokesperson said had suffered ""significant damage.""Later Friday morning, the Israeli military announced that Iranian forces had fired about 100 drones at Israel, as Netanyahu vowed the fighting would last “as many days as it takes”. The Israeli military said it was working to intercept the Iranian attack, and there were no immediate indications of significant damage caused by the drones.Israel had told the Trump administration the largescale attacks were coming, officials in the US and Israel said.Iran confirmed Mohammad Bagheri, the commander-in-chief of the military and the second-highest commander after the supreme leader, was among those killed, as was Gen. Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Revolutionary Guard.Ali Shamkhani, a leading politician who was overseeing the nuclear talks with US, was also killed, officials said. Khamenei moved quickly to appoint some replacements, aiming to avoid the appearance of a leadership vacuum. In all, at least 20 senior commanders were killed, two regional sources said. The head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, was also reported to be among them.Residents of Tehran reported hearing huge explosions, and Iranian state television broadcast images of smoke and fire billowing from buildings. Long lines were forming at gas stations and grocery stores. Dozens were killed in Iran and more than 300 others injured, according to unofficial figures cited by the Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.In a televised message, President Masoud Pezeshkian urged Iranians to stand by their leaders and said a powerful response “will make Israel regret its foolish act”. Iran told the UNSC, due to meet on Friday at Tehran’s request, in a letter that it will respond decisively and proportionally to Israel’s “unlawful” and “cowardly” acts. Iran’s Nournews said 78 people had been killed and 329 injured in Israeli attacks on residential areas in Tehran.",Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the assault as a last resort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.

Air patrols, base alerts amid escalation



Troop numbers rise amid Middle East crisis







American air-defence systems and naval assets played a key role in helping Israel intercept a barrage of ballistic missiles fired by Iran on Friday, a US official confirmed, as tensions between Tehran and Tel Aviv threaten to engulf the region in a wider war.The missile launches were in retaliation for Israel’s earlier airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and the killing of top military leaders. According to US officials, American Patriot missile-defence batteries and Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) systems stationed in the Middle East were activated as Iran launched multiple waves of missiles, including at Tel Aviv.Naval forces also assisted Israel’s response, though it remains unclear whether US ships fired interceptors or supported the effort with their advanced radar tracking systems. Officials said the Navy has ordered the USS Thomas Hudner, a destroyer equipped to counter ballistic missiles, to sail from the western to the eastern Mediterranean. A second destroyer is also being repositioned to provide additional options if requested by the White House.Meanwhile, the USS Carl Vinson, currently in the Arabian Sea, remains the only US aircraft carrier in the region, but other carriers—Nimitz in the Indo-Pacific and George Washington now departing Japan—could be directed toward the Middle East if needed.American fighter jets are now conducting air patrols across the region to protect US military personnel and installations. Air bases have increased security protocols as the US military prepares for any further escalation.President Donald Trump was briefed on the situation Friday in a meeting with his National Security Council, officials said, as forces on the ground braced for further fallout.The US has approximately 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East—up from the typical 30,000—with numbers having peaked at 43,000 last October. This rise came amid a string of Iran-linked attacks, including Houthi strikes on vessels in the Red Sea and the October 7 Hamas assault on Israel that sparked the ongoing Gaza war.Following those attacks, then-President Joe Biden had surged naval power to the region in a show of deterrence aimed at Iran and Hezbollah. On October 1, 2024, US Navy destroyers launched a dozen interceptors as more than 200 missiles rained down on Israel from Iran.Friday’s interception efforts mark the latest demonstration of American military coordination with Israel amid deepening fears of a full-scale regional war.","US air-defence systems and naval assets played a key role in helping Israel intercept a barrage of ballistic missiles fired by Iran on Friday.

Exit Permits Required for Private Sector Expats Starting July 1

This exit permit system, which is common elsewhere in the Gulf under the kafala sponsorship system , will be fully in force from July 1, 2025.





, will be fully in force from July 1, 2025. Practical implications: Private company employees cannot leave Kuwait, even temporarily, without their employer’s (the “kafeel”) approval submitted through the official government portals.





This applies to both permanent departures and routine vacations.





The process is digitized via the “Sahel” app or the Ashal Manpower Portal, but ultimate approval rests with the employer.





How the Exit Permit Process Works

Step 1: Worker submits application



Using their Civil ID and personal information, workers apply online via the Sahel app or the Ashal portal. They select start and end dates for the permit. The permit itself does not require a specific return date.

Upon employer approval, the permit is issued immediately, with no further formalities.

Upon employer approval, the permit is issued immediately, with no further formalities. Handling denials or non-response:



If the employer fails to respond or denies a request without cause, the employee can submit a complaint to the Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) to intervene.

Who is affected:

All private sector expatriates under Article 18 residency and their dependents. Government employees have long required departmental permission for travel.





Why is this rule introduced now?

Prevent illegal departures.

Ensure workers fulfill their financial and contractual obligations.

Crack down on abuses like absconding and labor market irregularities.



The Kafala Sponsorship System and the Exit Permit

While many Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have reformed or abolished parts of kafala, Kuwait’s reintroduction of the exit permit strengthens employer oversight.





The Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) outlined several objectives for this rule:



Strengthen oversight: Provide better government tracking of expatriate movement.



Balance rights: “Ensure a balance between the workers’ and employers’ rights,” preventing workers from leaving without fulfilling obligations.



Minimise violations: Reduce unauthorized departures such as workers absconding without clearing debts or proper documentation.



Curb visa trading: Help combat illicit visa trading and labor market irregularities.





Stricter Family Visa Regulations and the KD800 Salary Threshold





Minimum salary requirement:



To sponsor spouses and children under Article 22 residency, expatriates must earn at least KD800 (approximately $2,610) per month.





To sponsor spouses and children under Article 22 residency, expatriates must earn at least KD800 (approximately $2,610) per month. Background:



This salary threshold was introduced in January 2024 under Ministerial Resolution No. 56. Initially, applicants also had to hold a university degree and be employed in a profession matching their qualifications.



However, a July 2024 amendment removed the degree requirement but maintained the income threshold as the primary eligibility factor.

Enforcement campaign:



Kuwait’s Residence Affairs Investigations Department is actively identifying expatriates who initially met the KD800 salary but later fell below it due to job changes or salary reductions.

Those affected must regularize their status within one month, or they risk having their dependents sent back to their home countries.



Other Important Provisions and Exceptions





Profession consistency:



According to Article 29 of the revised regulations, only expatriates employed in jobs consistent with their declared professions can sponsor family members.





According to Article 29 of the revised regulations, only expatriates employed in jobs consistent with their declared professions can sponsor family members. Discretionary exceptions:



Children under five years old or born inside Kuwait may be granted exceptions, but these require review and approval by the Director General of Residency Affairs.





Children under five years old or born inside Kuwait may be granted exceptions, but these require review and approval by the Director General of Residency Affairs. Open application process:



The Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the family visa process is open to all expatriates regardless of nationality or educational background, as long as they meet the salary requirement.





Kuwait has long been a destination for expatriates, attracting workers worldwide with promises of stable jobs and tax-free salaries. However, the Gulf nation is now tightening controls on who enters, stays, and leaves, introducing new rules that impact everything from labor rights to family sponsorship.If you work or live in Kuwait or are planning to move there, here is a detailed breakdown of the latest visa and residency regulations, including exit permits for private sector employees, updated family sponsorship rules, and how these changes affect expats.Earlier this week, Kuwait announced a significant change affecting the country’s large expatriate workforce: all foreign private sector employees, who hold Article 18 residency, must now obtain explicit employer approval before leaving Kuwait.The system is designed to be accessible, digital, and 24/7.Kuwaiti authorities say the measure aims to:The new exit permit is tightly connected to the kafala system, prevalent across the Gulf. Under kafala, migrant workers’ visas are linked to their employers, giving sponsors significant control over employees’ legal status and movement.Kuwait has also updated rules for family sponsorship, emphasizing sponsors’ ability to financially support their dependents.","New Kuwait rules require employer-approved exit and KD800 income to sponsor dependents.

Israeli airstrikes kill top Iranian commanders



Global tensions spike



US response and regional fallout







Iran launched a large-scale missile barrage on Israel late Friday, triggering air raid sirens and explosions across cities including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, in what is now the most intense escalation between the two countries in decades.The assault, which Iran called “Severe Punishment”, came in retaliation for Israel’s unprecedented strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets earlier the same day. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed revenge in a televised address, declaring, “The armed forces of the Islamic republic will inflict heavy blows upon this malevolent enemy... the consequences of the Israeli attack will bring it to ruin.”Israel’s military confirmed “dozens of missiles” had been launched and said many were intercepted mid-air. “The attack is ongoing,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that “the explosions you are hearing are from interceptions or fallen projectiles.” Authorities urged citizens to seek shelter.Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed it targeted “dozens of military positions” inside Israel. Iran’s IRNA also said its forces shot down two Israeli fighter jets during a retaliatory air raid—claims that could not be independently verified.Earlier Friday, Israel launched a massive assault using around 200 aircraft and pre-positioned explosive drones to strike nearly 100 targets, including Iran’s key enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordo, and a nuclear research centre in Isfahan.The IDF said the strikes killed senior Iranian figures, including Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Gen. Hossein Salami, and Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a clear and present danger to Israel’s very survival,” adding that the mission had been “months in the making.”Also read: PM Modi receives call from Netanyahu after Israel strikes Iran, urges restoration of peace

Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at the UN, labelled Israel’s actions “state terrorism” and warned in a letter to the Security Council that “Israel will come to deeply regret this reckless aggression.” The IAEA confirmed damage to the Natanz facility and said it was monitoring for radiation leaks.On the streets of Israel, fear gripped the population. Supermarkets were flooded, public spaces emptied, and the IDF began mobilising reservists, preparing for possible action from Iranian allies like Hezbollah.The US had cautioned Israel earlier in the week, worried the strikes might derail nuclear diplomacy, but was informed of the operation in advance. US forces were placed on high alert and some diplomats in Baghdad were evacuated. President Donald Trump warned Iran: “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.”As missiles flew, Khamenei accused Israel of “striking residential centres” and vowed it would not “escape safely from this great crime.”With the UN Security Council preparing an emergency session and calls for restraint coming from around the world, the shadow war between Israel and Iran has now exploded into open confrontation—one with the potential to drag the entire region into conflict.","Iran launched a large-scale missile barrage on Israel late Friday, triggering air raid sirens and explosions across cities including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated.

LONDON: A British Indian relative of an elderly Indian couple killed on board the Air India flight has spoken of his anger with the airline, saying the fleet that Air India uses is terrible.Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.Jogi’s cousin’s in-laws — Vallabh Nagji Agheda, a former general manager of the electricity board in Gujarat, and his wife, Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, a housewife, both from Vadodara — were in seats 21E and 21F on the Boeing aircraft. Both in their 70s, they were to come to the UK to spend a few months with their eldest daughter, her husband, and their grandchildren who live in Reading. The daughter and her whole family were en route to Heathrow on Thursday evening to fly to India.Jogi’s cousin, and his wife, an IT engineer, had been due to go to Gatwick on Thursday night to pick them up. The elderly couple have three daughters and the other two live in Gujarat. The two sisters had rushed to Ahmedabad on Thursday with their husbands to get DNA tests done so their parents’ remains could be handed over.“We are all absolutely shattered.We are all not able to digest this reality that we have lost them sadly — my cousin’s wife has lost both parents in just a single instant,” said Jogi, getting emotional. “They are the closest relatives we have in the UK. We don’t have any other family here. We are all a close-knit family,” he said, as he prepared to travel to Reading.Maharashtra-born Jogi, a British Indian social media influencer living in London, said though the couple were in their 70s they were enjoying the perfect retirement in Vadodara and spending time with all their grandchildren. “They were very fit and healthy and their life expectancy was beyond 90. They had huge love and affection from the whole family.”He said there was a lot of British concern with Air India among the Indian diaspora in Britain at “the way they treat passengers like luggage”. “The queue management is pathetic and people in the Indian community say the Air India fleet is the most horrible one. The ex-Etihad Airways Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are pathetic – the ones running from Heathrow. Seats falling apart is the default – whether 787 or 777-300ER, these Boeing fleets are horrible.

LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000.

What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

Starmer Slams Badenoch For 'Echoing Kremlin Talk' In Heated UK Parliament Clash

LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.

UK Threatens To Sue Abramovich Over £2.5 BN Chelsea Sale As Russia-UK Tensions Escalate





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”",Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

The United Kingdom's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia, meanwhile, China poses a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”. The government's strategic review is set to be concluded on Monday, the Guardian reported.A 130-page document authored by three advisers to UK PM Keir Starmer also suggested on drawing extensively on lessons from the war in Ukraine. While Russia was the central concern, the document also highlighted China, that has at times cooperated with Moscow. It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Prince William may be on holiday with Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, but his work as the Duke of Cornwall never truly takes a back seat.During a recent visit to the Duchy of Cornwall estate, The Telegraph witnessed how William remains focused on improving life for its residentseven while away with his family.One of the family’s favourite spots is Tresco, an island in the Isles of Scilly, part of the duchy. Here, the prince is well known for chatting with locals about community needs and development. His efforts have led to tangible improvements, including a new healthcare centre with a maternity suite, housing plans for essential workers like teachers and doctors, and initiatives promoting sustainable tourism.The Isles of Scilly hold a special place for William, as family holidays there echo his own childhood trips with Princess Diana and the future King Charles, People reported.A holidaymaker who spotted the couple in 2020 told the Daily Mirror, “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather. I did do a double-take. They were really friendly and said hello.”In May this year, Prince William returned to the Isles of Scilly on official duty — much to the chagrin of his family.“My family are very upset I’m here without them,” he told the Daily Mail. “The children will kill me if I don’t go home later.” He was spotted buying pastries at a local cafe, likely to bring back for them.The Duchy of Cornwall, established by King Edward III in 1337, covers around 130,000 acres of land and assets, supporting the heir to the throne and his family financially. But William’s focus goes beyond finance, he is committed to bettering the lives of those living on duchy land, prioritising sustainability, mental health, and charitable partnerships.“II’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.","Prince William is on holiday with his family in the Isles of Scilly, part of the Duchy of Cornwall.

Prince William is quietly changing what it means to be heir to the throne and those who work with him say he’s not afraid to do things differently.Following King Charles’ accession in 2022, the Prince of Wales inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales. Now worth more than £800 million, the duchy provides income for the heir to the throne but under Prince William’s leadership, it is becoming far more than just a source of funds.The 42-year-old royal is reportedly a demanding leader who visits parts of the duchy every four to six weeks.Will Bax, the duchy’s secretary, called William ""pretty demanding,"" but in a good way.Speaking to The Telegraph, he said that the Prince is ""a man on a mission.""“He’s easy to follow because he’s got great conviction and personality, and he really wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of social interest and his desire to have a positive impact in the world.”Estate director Ben Murphy also called William’s leadership “energising”, and compared it to his father’s, ""healthy impatience, as his father did,"" which ""puts the wind in our sails,"" PeoplePrince William sees the Duchy as more than just a royal portfolio.“I see the Duchy as an extension of the work we do with the Royal Foundation,” he told the newspaper. “I see it as a branch of my philanthropy.""He further added that there’s so much good that can be done in the rural world, ""I see it as another arm to the work that I want to do, which is being a positive force for good.”Key priorities under his stewardship included tackling homelessness, supporting mental health among farmers, and boosting sustainability across rural communities. The duchy has partnered with local groups on housing initiatives and mental health outreach, particularly for those working in agriculture who often face isolation.“I’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.“That, I feel as Duke of Cornwall, is something I should be doing. It’s about responsibility, it’s about leadership and doing what’s right on the social issues of our time.”Even family getaways are laced with purpose. During visits to the Isles of Scilly with Kate and their children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — the Prince often chats with locals about their needs. These conversations have already led to drastic results, including improved healthcare facilities, new housing for key workers, and steps towards more sustainable tourism.Bax said, “He’s asking us to change and evolve in a way to deliver positive impact at scale and at pace.”The duchy’s most recent Integrated Annual Report, released in July, reported a surplus of £23.9 million for the 2023–24 financial year, Prince William’s first full year as Duke of Cornwall.","Duchy of Cornwall is a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales.

LONDON: British comedian and actor Russell Brand arrived at a London court on Friday where he was due to enter pleas on five charges of sexual offences including rape and sexual assault.He faces one count of rape, one of oral rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault between 1999 and 2005, involving four women.Brand, 49, arrived at Southwark Crown Court in an open-buttoned shirt and dark blazer for the plea hearing, after being granted conditional bail at a previous hearing.He gained international recognition as the husband of pop star Katy Perry, but is better known in the UK for his hyper-sexualised and often lewd comedy routines and TV and radio appearances in the early 2000s.Now living partly in the US, Brand appeared at Westminster magistrates court in central London earlier this month, where he showed no emotion as a prosecutor read out allegations against him.Prosecutors charged Brand following a police probe into allegations aired in a 2003 Channel 4 documentary.He is accused of raping one woman in a hotel room following an event in the southern Bournemouth area in 1999.Another charge relates to the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in central London.The accusations involve four women, including one who was a TV worker, and another who was a radio station worker at the time of the alleged assaults.In a video response on X after he was charged in April, Brand said he was ""grateful"" for the ""opportunity"" to defend himself.""I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I've never engaged in non-consensual activity,"" he said in the video.Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager, eventually working as an MTV presenter and host of a Big Brother spin-off.He presented a show on the BBC's Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for ""Fawlty Towers"" actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.Once a left-leaning political campaigner and Hollywood star, he has rebranded himself as a conservative guru to his millions of social media followers.Brand often peddles conspiracy theories, as well as sharing wellness tips, in his anti-establishment videos. Last year, he said he became a Christian after being baptised in the Thames river.","British comedian and actor Russell Brand arrived at a London court on Friday.

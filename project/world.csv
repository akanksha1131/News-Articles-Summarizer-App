Former US Presidents in attendance





Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, scheduled for January 20, is shaping up to be a star-studded and politically significant event, with an array of high-profile attendees confirmed.Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg will attend the ceremony, NBC News reported, citing an unnamed official involved in the event’s planning. The three influential tech moguls will be seated together on the platform alongside prominent guests, including Trump’s cabinet nominees.Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the majority owner of X, has emerged as one of Trump’s closest allies. His presence at the inauguration is unsurprising, given his alignment with Trump’s hard-right politics and his financial support for the presidential campaign. Musk’s role in Trump’s administration is already taking shape, as he has been tapped to co-lead an advisory commission dubbed the department of government efficiency (DOGE), aimed at reducing federal spending and bureaucracy.Bezos and Zuckerberg, while less closely aligned with Trump, have made efforts to cultivate a relationship with the president-elect.External affairs minister S Jaishankar will represent the country at the ceremony, following an invitation from the Trump-Vance inaugural committee.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also confirmed her invitation, stating that she hopes to attend if her schedule permits.China’s President Xi Jinping will send a high-level envoy to represent Beijing, while Argentine President Javier Milei—breaking tradition—plans to attend the event himself.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has received an invitation but has yet to announce his decision, and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has also been invited despite facing legal troubles and a ban from running for political office in Brazil until 2030.Joe Biden has confirmed his attendance, dismissing the controversy surrounding his presence as “childish games.”Several former US presidents will also be present, including Barack Obama, George W Bush, and Bill Clinton. They will be accompanied by their spouses, with the exception of Michelle Obama, who has opted to skip the event.Trump’s inauguration marks a break from certain traditions, with his team extending invitations to several international leaders and former heads of state, signaling a global stage for the event.","Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg will attend the inauguration.

How an intoxicated ‘nervous flyer’ forced a New York flight to divert to Dublin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-an-intoxicated-nervous-flyer-forced-a-new-york-flight-to-divert-to-dublin/articleshow/117249838.cms,"Representative image

A United Airlines passenger's attempt to calm his nerves became a legal issue as he ended up urinating in his seat and aisle. 34-year-old American climate research analyst Zachary Greear ended up getting a two-month suspended sentence by the Dublin district court for his disruptive behavior on the transatlantic flight from Amsterdam to New York after he mixed Xanax with alcohol to beat his anxiety.Greear pleaded guilty to three offences under Ireland's Air Navigation and Transport Act: intoxication, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, and causing annoyance onboard an aircraft, as reported by the Guardian.The court heard that during the flight, Greear became highly intoxicated and urinated in his seat and in the aisle, causing the captain to make the decision to divert the plane to Dublin, dumping €30,000 worth of fuel.Greear's solicitor, Eoghan O'Sullivan, said his client was ""horrified and embarrassed"" by his behaviour and had offered a ""most sincere apology"". The judge suspended the jail sentence for two years, describing Greear's behaviour as ""appalling"", but noted his written apology and compliance with an order to pay €10,000 for damages he caused.At Monday's hearing, O'Sullivan indicated his client's willingness to compensate for the diversion costs, initially offering $5,000.The judge deemed this amount insufficient and demanded double the sum, emphasising the serious impact on flight crew, passengers, and airline operations. “Can you imagine the fear and trauma he caused to a pilot who is trying to manage people safely on his aircraft, to passengers, to employees of the airline who have to dump fuel and turn around a flight and land in a jurisdiction they never expected to be in?” the judge questioned.The Garda (national police force of Ireland) stated that on arrest, Greear ""couldn't understand where he was"" due to his level of intoxication but had since apologised. He had no previous convictions.","Zachary Greear, 34, mixed Xanax with alcohol to calm his anxiety.

Trump floats creating ‘external revenue service’ for tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-floats-creating-external-revenue-service-for-tariffs/articleshow/117250797.cms,"Creating a new revenue agency would require a vote in Congress. (AI image for representation)

Tariff Uncertainty

President-elect Donald Trump said he would create an “External Revenue Service” tasked with collecting tariffs on foreign imports, the latest indication that the Republican aims to carry out his promises for sweeping trade levies when he retakes office.“I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources,” Trump said in a post to his Truth Social network on Tuesday.“We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service,” he added.The president-elect didn’t provide any details of whether he planned to pursue the creation of a new government agency, or if his proposal was largely a branding exercise for existing government functions.Democrats immediately mocked the idea.“Seems like a ‘concept of a plan,’ huh?” said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House tax-writing committee, referring to Trump’s vague promise in a debate last year to revamp health care.Tariffs are currently collected by Customs and Border Protection , whose agents review paperwork, perform audits, and collect levies and penalties, with the money then deposited into the Treasury Department’s General Fund. They account for less than 2% of federal revenue.But the exercise underscores Trump’s desire to frame tariffs on foreign imports as a way to offset costs for his policy agenda that would otherwise be directly shouldered by taxpayers. Trump was elected on vows to levy tariffs on both allies and adversaries, casting them as tools to bring in more revenue to the US and compel companies to bring back manufacturing jobs — as well as offset the growing deficit.Analysts greeted the news with skepticism and highlighted that the CBP already collects that revenue, a function dating back to the era of Alexander Hamilton. They also noted that tariff revenues aren’t an external source given that they are paid for by US consumers.“This is gimmicky branding that will duplicate an existing federal agency to collect customs revenue,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former Republican staff member at the Senate Finance Committee. “It is not collecting external revenue, it is collecting a tax” on Americans who pay for tariffs, he added.Creating a new revenue agency would require a vote in Congress and likely wouldn’t change much about the process of gathering tariff revenues, said Ernie Tedeschi, who is director of economics at Yale University’s Budget Lab and a former Biden administration official.“A new agency would require Congressional authorization and funding, and since it would just be taking over existing CBP functionality, it’s unlikely much of the day-to-day mechanics of collecting tariff revenue would change dramatically,” Tedeschi said.During the campaign, Trump floated minimum tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imported goods, and 60% or higher on shipments from China. In November, he also vowed to hit Canada, Mexico and China with additional levies if the countries did not do more to help secure US borders and prevent the flow of undocumented migrants and illicit drugs.Mainstream economists warn that Trump’s threatened tariffs are poised to raise prices for US consumers — exacerbating public anxiety over inflation — redirect or reduce trade flows, and fail to bring in the revenue the president-elect has predicted. While Trump won the support of many Wall Street executives and corporate leaders, uncertainty over his plans to institute tariffs have rattled markets and the business community.Members of Trump’s incoming team have been discussing slowly ramping up tariffs month by month, an approach aimed at boosting their leverage in negotiations with other countries while also avoiding a spike in inflation, according to people familiar with the matter.That proposal is in its early stages and has not yet been presented to Trump, the people said.","Donald Trump said he would create an ‘External Revenue Service’ tasked with collecting tariffs on foreign imports.

Trump’s Defence Secy Grilled By U.S. Senators | Key Moments From Pete Hegseth Confirmation Hearing

Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump 's nominee for Defence Secretary, defended himself during his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, pledging to instil a ""warrior culture"" at the Pentagon if confirmed.Hegseth stressed that his leadership would prioritise readiness, strength, and military discipline, citing his own experience in the Army National Guard as a foundation for transforming the military’s culture.“It’s time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,” Hegseth declared, aiming to bring change to an institution he sees as bogged down by bureaucracy.Despite Hegseth’s defence, the hearing quickly turned into a confrontation, as senators questioned him about past allegations of sexual assault and reports of excessive drinking. Hegseth was asked directly about a 2017 accusation, which he dismissed as part of a “smear campaign.” He also responded to questions about his behaviour, pledging that he would abstain from alcohol if confirmed for the position.Senators raised additional concerns about Hegseth’s lack of senior military and national security experience, which is typically expected from a Defence Secretary nominee. He was also grilled over his previous views on women in combat, a stance he had softened since his nomination.On diversity, Hegseth opposed current policies, claiming that modern diversity and inclusion initiatives “divide” the troops and do not prioritise merit.Despite the controversies, Hegseth’s Republican allies continued to back his nomination, calling him a “breath of fresh air” and a leader capable of shaking up the Pentagon.With a Republican-controlled Senate, Hegseth's confirmation could depend on whether he can win over enough votes from both parties. The over four-hour hearing marked the beginning of a weeklong marathon, with the Republican-led Senate working swiftly to confirm some of Trump's nominees before Inauguration Day on January 20.","Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Defence Secretary, defended himself during his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.

TAIPEI: The Ministry of National Defence (MND) on Wednesday detected 24 aircraft from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and six vessels from the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) operating around Taiwan until 6 a.m. (UTC+8).According to the MND, 21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern, and eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).Sharing a post on X, MND wrote, ""24 PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today.""It added, ""21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern and eastern ADIZ. We have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.""On Tuesday, the MND detected 22 PLA aircraft of various types, including J-16, KJ-500, and others. Out of 22 PLA aircraft, 19 crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered the northern, central, southwestern and eastern ADIZ in conducting air-sea joint training along with other PLAN vessels.Earlier on January 13, the Ministry detected six aircraft from the PLA and six naval vessels from the PLAN as of 6:00 am (UTC+8), with four of the aircraft crossing the median line and entering Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ.In recent weeks, China has been visibly boosting its ability to invade Taiwanese beaches with innovative new naval equipment. This includes the formal launching of an enormous landing helicopter assault (LHA) vessel, the likes of which no other navy in the world possesses, and mass production of floating bridge docks to assist the unloading of ships during beach landings. Both type of equipment are strong indications that China is serious about one day invading Taiwan.The Taiwan-China issue is a complex and longstanding geopolitical conflict centred on Taiwan's sovereignty. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates its own government, military, and economy, functioning as a de facto independent state.However, China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists on the ""One China"" policy, which asserts that there is only one China, with Beijing as its capital.This has fuelled decades of tension, especially since the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took control of mainland China.Beijing has consistently expressed its goal of reunification with Taiwan, using diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to isolate Taiwan internationally. Meanwhile, Taiwan, supported by a significant portion of its population, continues to maintain its independence.","The Ministry of National Defence (MND) on Wednesday detected 24 aircraft from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and six vessels. 21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern, and eastern Air Defence Identification Zone.

Gov. Abbott orders flags at full staff for Trump's inauguration

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday announced that flags at the US Capitol, currently at half-staff to honour former President Jimmy Carter, would be temporarily raised on January 20 to mark Donald Trump’s second term.“On January 20th, the flags at the Capitol will fly at full-staff to celebrate our country coming together behind the inauguration of our 47th President, Donald Trump,” Johnson stated.The decision defies President Joe Biden’s proclamation of a 30-day mourning period for Carter, who passed away on December 29 a the age of 100. According to Johnson, the flags will return to half-staff the day after the inauguration, continuing the tribute to Carter until January 28, as per US flag code .Trump had publicly criticised the prospect of lowered flags during his inauguration, calling it unprecedented and accusing Democrats of relishing the moment. However, according to a New York Times report, flags have historically flown at half-staff during an inauguration if it falls in the mourning period. President Richard Nixon’s 1973 ceremony occurred under similar circumstances, following President Harry Truman’s death.Meanwhile, Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida raised its flags shortly after Carter’s funeral, ignoring state directives to keep them lowered.“No American can be happy about this,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier this month.It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors, reported The Associated Press. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that flags in their states would also be raised for Inauguration Day.“While we honour the service of a former president, we must also celebrate the service of an incoming president,” Abbott stated. DeSantis echoed this sentiment, citing the day’s patriotic importance.The order affects flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at US embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels.However, the White House confirmed there would be no changes to Biden’s original order. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that the 30-day mourning period would remain in effect at federal facilities.","Gov. Abbott orders flags at full staff for Trump's inauguration.

China plans to blow Starlink satellites in orbit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/whale-strategy-china-plans-to-blow-elon-musk-starlink-satellites-in-a-taiwan-war/articleshow/117241111.cms,"Starlink’s dominance in space has sparked concerns among global powers.

Why it matters

Starlink’s decentralized satellite constellation has proven critical for battlefield communications, enabling high-speed data transfer and resilient coordination. This makes it a target in any potential conflict, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan.

Starlink has redefined the role of space-based communication in modern warfare. By providing real-time coordination and connectivity, the network has offered militaries unprecedented strategic advantages, as seen during Ukraine’s defense against Russia.

Starlink’s dominance in satellite internet technology, fueled by SpaceX’s reusable rocket launches, has drawn both admiration and scrutiny. Its ability to provide global connectivity, including in remote and conflict-affected areas, has made it indispensable.

China’s strategy to counteract Starlink underscores the growing importance of space superiority in geopolitical conflicts, including a potential Taiwan Strait crisis.

If successful, China’s plan could disrupt communications for adversaries relying on Starlink, tilting the balance in their favor during military engagements. This approach also highlights how advancements in AI and space technology are shaping the future of warfare.

Critics warn that over-reliance on Elon Musk ’s centralized control poses risks, particularly given his unpredictable decisions and business ties to China.

’s centralized control poses risks, particularly given his unpredictable decisions and business ties to China. As a result, Taiwan and the European Union are pursuing independent satellite programs to reduce dependence on Starlink. The EU has allocated $2.6 billion for its own constellation, emphasizing the need for technological sovereignty.

The big picture

Zoom in

The researchers developed a binary AI algorithm inspired by whales’ hunting behavior, which channels prey into a confined area for efficient capture. Similarly, the algorithm enables Chinese satellites to coordinate maneuvers and optimize energy use, tracking Starlink units with precision. This approach reduces the computational complexity of targeting a vast constellation and allows for rapid action planning—completed in under two minutes, according to the researchers,the SCMP report said.

Directed-energy weapons : China is exploring various tools for satellite disruption, including high-power microwave weapons like the Relativistic Klystron Amplifier (RKA) and solid-state lasers. While these technologies are promising, they face significant challenges, such as energy demands and overheating. Other advanced systems, such as X-ray lasers inspired by the US’s Strategic Defense Initiative, are also under consideration.

Starlink’s military edge

Between the lines

The Taiwan context

Taiwan, inspired by Ukraine’s effective use of Starlink, has embarked on developing its own LEO satellite network to bolster communication resilience. The Taiwanese Space Agency announced the project in December 2022, aiming to ensure continuity in the face of attacks on its undersea cables, which form the backbone of its external communications.

Taiwan’s reliance on submarine cables—15 of which connect it to global digital networks—poses a critical vulnerability. These cables carry over 99% of international data, but their location in an earthquake-prone region and proximity to Chinese waters heighten the risk of accidental or deliberate damage. Recent incidents involving Chinese vessels severing cables near Taiwan’s shores have raised alarms about potential digital blockades during a conflict.

Taiwan’s satellite ambitions face significant hurdles. The lack of indigenous launch capabilities forces reliance on foreign partners, delaying progress until at least 2028. Furthermore, the country’s limited expertise in space-based communications and struggles to retain talent in its burgeoning space sector add to the difficulties.

What’s next

Chinese researchers have developed a strategy to disrupt Elon Musk-owned SpaceX 's Starlink satellite network in wartime, using AI-powered simulations inspired by the hunting techniques of whales. The approach, reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), could allow China to neutralize the network’s military advantages, which have been demonstrated in conflicts like Ukraine.As per the SCMP report, the Chinese research team, led by Wu Yunhua of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, simulated an operation in which 99 satellites could effectively target 1,400 Starlink satellites within 12 hours. The study, published in the Chinese academic journal Systems Engineering and Electronics, details how these satellites could track and potentially disable Starlink using directed-energy weapons like lasers and microwaves.Starlink’s decentralized design, which includes thousands of interconnected satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), makes targeting individual units inefficient. Instead, the Chinese researchers propose a coordinated effort to disable large sections of the network using a combination of AI algorithms and advanced weaponry.As per a New York Times report, Starlink, a SpaceX initiative, boasts over 6,700 satellites and plans to expand into tens of thousands, accounting for 53% of all active satellites and providing high-speed internet globally. Its services have proved essential in conflict zones, such as Ukraine, where over 42,000 Starlink terminals aid military and civilian communication.Starlink’s strategic significance is growing, valued at nearly $140 billion, and serves regions without traditional internet access, including areas affected by war and natural disasters. Musk's reusable rockets allow weekly satellite launches, giving SpaceX an edge in deploying a low-Earth orbit constellation. Starlink's affordable hardware and services attract diverse users, including militaries, businesses, and NGOs. Despite the technology’s benefits, Musk's centralized control and unpredictable decisions, like restricting Starlink in Crimea, have raised global concerns about over-dependence on one individual.China’s push to develop anti-satellite capabilities reflects broader geopolitical concerns about space security. The Chinese government and military have heavily funded this research, with institutions like the Harbin Institute of Technology contributing to the effort. Notably, both Harbin and Nanjing University are under US sanctions for their involvement in developing military technologies.The potential implications extend beyond Starlink. China is also building its own LEO satellite constellations, which it views as essential for communication resilience. However, this comes with risks, as any physical attack on satellites could generate debris, threatening the safety of all space assets, including the International Space Station.The evolving space race underscores the critical need for robust satellite defenses. China’s advancements in counter-satellite technologies challenge the assumption of Starlink’s invulnerability, potentially forcing the US and its allies to reassess their space security strategies.For Taiwan, developing a sovereign satellite network remains a strategic priority but will require overcoming significant challenges. As tensions in the Taiwan Strait persist, the focus on communication resilience and space-based infrastructure will only intensify.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese researchers have developed a strategy to disrupt Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink satellite network in wartime.

The Broader Implications



Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer’s marriage was one of the most publicized unions in the literary and artistic worlds. Their creative synergy, open discussions on personal topics, and shared love for pushing boundaries in their respective fields made them a compelling pair. However, their relationship officially ended in November 2022, marking the conclusion of 11 years of marriage. The reasons behind their split, while layered, include issues of personal boundaries, public scrutiny, and allegations that have surfaced in Gaiman’s personal life.Amanda Palmer, a musician and performance artist, married Neil Gaiman, the celebrated author of works likeand, in 2011. The couple’s marriage was unconventional from the start. They publicly discussed having an open marriage, a topic that invited both admiration and criticism. Gaiman and Palmer were often candid about the challenges of balancing their creative lives with the demands of marriage and parenthood.However, their relationship began showing cracks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Gaiman’s decision to travel from New Zealand to the Isle of Skye—breaking lockdown protocols—drew significant public attention. Palmer, who remained in New Zealand with their son, made cryptic social media posts hinting at tension. While the couple reconciled temporarily after this episode, it was clear that the strain on their relationship was mounting.In late 2022, Palmer and Gaiman announced their divorce. While the announcement was framed as amicable, it left many fans wondering about the deeper reasons behind their separation. The couple emphasized their commitment to co-parenting their son and maintaining a friendship, but the specifics of their breakup were not fully disclosed.Palmer’s departure from the marriage appeared to be influenced by both personal and external factors. The open nature of their relationship, while celebrated for its honesty, may have also created vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the intense public scrutiny that followed Gaiman’s actions during the pandemic added a layer of strain.Adding a controversial dimension to the story are the allegations against Neil Gaiman that surfaced in early 2025. Multiple women came forward with accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, bringing renewed attention to Gaiman’s personal life. These allegations, though unproven, have significantly impacted Gaiman’s reputation. Some of the accusations involve power imbalances in professional settings, with claims that Gaiman leveraged his influence inappropriately. While he has yet to publicly address these allegations comprehensively, they cast a shadow over his career and personal relationships.Gaiman and Palmer’s relationship was uniquely positioned at the intersection of art, literature, and modern media. Their openness about topics like polyamory, mental health, and creative struggles endeared them to fans but also exposed them to intense scrutiny. Social media, in particular, played a significant role in amplifying both support and criticism.During the pandemic, Palmer’s social media posts—including a now-deleted blog post about feeling abandoned—hinted at deeper personal struggles. While the couple’s public personas suggested resilience and mutual understanding, it became increasingly clear that their private life was fraught with challenges. The scrutiny likely added pressure to an already strained relationship, making reconciliation difficult.Since the divorce, Palmer has focused on her music and activism. She has spoken about the importance of self-care and boundaries , themes that resonate with her fans. While she has not explicitly commented on the allegations against Gaiman, her post-divorce interviews suggest a desire to distance herself from negativity and focus on personal growth.In one interview, Palmer emphasized the difficulty of navigating public and private life as a couple in the spotlight. “When you share your life so openly, it’s easy for people to assume they know the full story,” she said. “But relationships are complex, and sometimes, stepping away is the healthiest choice.”The end of Gaiman and Palmer’s marriage highlights broader conversations about the complexities of modern relationships. From the challenges of maintaining an open marriage to the impact of public scrutiny, their story reflects the difficulties many couples face—albeit on a much larger stage.The allegations against Gaiman add another layer to this narrative, raising questions about accountability, consent, and the power dynamics often present in creative industries. As these allegations continue to unfold, they may influence how Gaiman’s work is perceived and how future collaborations are approached.","Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer’s marriage ended in November 2022.

Questions on sexual assault, infidelity

On women in combat roles

Donald Trump's defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth faced an excruciating hearing by the senate for his confirmation in which several aspects of his life, his past comments were scrutinized. While Hegseth is not new to controversy, a video is going viral now claiming that Hegseth forgot one of his kids' names as he was introducing his family. ""Sorry, it's a lot of them,"" Hegseth said as he fumbled on Rex's name. But he did not actually forget the name. He just got stuck which he admitted and overcame.Out of the seven children, four are Hegseth's biological and three are his stepchildren. He shares one daughter with his current wife Jennifer and shares three other kids with his second wife Samantha Deering. Hegseth is a stepdad to Jennifer's three children.Pete Hegseth is one of the most controversial candidates in the incoming Trump cabinet. He was accused of sexually assaulting a woman and then paying her years later. Hegseth said it was a consensual act but he was blackmailed into paying the woman, Though Hegseth was not charged, the accusations surfaced after he was picked by Trump as his defense secretary.At the hearing too, the allegations came with Dem reps questioning him on that incident.""I am shocked that you would stand here and say you're completely cleared,"" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said.""Those were false charges, it was fully investigated and I've been completely cleared,"" Hegseth responded.""You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel in October 2017,"" Kaine said. ""You have admitted that you had sex while you were married to wife two after you just had fathered a child by wife three. You've admitted that,"" Kaine emphasized, suggesting that, ""if it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be secretary of defense.""""It was a false claim then, it's a false claim now,"" Hegseth said.Sen. Joni Ernst, who is a female veteran of the Iowa National Guard, pressed Hegseth on his prior comments speaking out against women serving in combat roles. “I did serve in Kuwait and missions in Iraq, so it is incredibly important I stress — and I hope that it confirmed you continue to stress — that every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and do so at any level, as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward,” the Iowa Republican said.“I want to know again — let's make it very clear for everyone here today — as Secretary of Defense, will you support women continuing to have the opportunity to serve in combat?”Hegseth agreed, saying that “women will have access to ground combat roles, given combat standards remain high.”","Pete Hegseth is one of the most controversial candidates in the incoming Trump cabinet.

A platform for connection and protest

Bridging cultures amid tensions

A community at risk

As the US Supreme Court deliberates on the future of TikTok, a wave of American users is finding refuge on Xiaohongshu , a Chinese social media platform. Dubbed “TikTok refugees,” they are downloading the app in droves, making it the most downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.The Supreme Court is set to rule on a law requiring TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , by January 19 or face a nationwide ban. Anticipating the worst, many TikTok users are joining Xiaohongshu, known in English as “Little Red Book,” and tagging their posts with hashtags like #TikTokRefugee.Xiaohongshu blends e-commerce, short videos, and posts, boasting 300 million monthly active users globally. While it was primarily popular among young women in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan, the app is now seeing an influx of American users—many of whom are using it to protest the potential TikTok ban .“I’m here to spite our government and learn about China,” said an American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy in a video addressed to Chinese users. She described the move as a form of trolling, adding, “We decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app.”Interactions between Chinese and American users on Xiaohongshu have been largely positive, with cultural exchanges flourishing. Chinese users are offering tips on navigating the app and teaching Chinese, while Americans are helping with English homework and learning about Chinese culture.“We are not enemies; we are human beings living in one world!” commented a Chinese user on a post by Amanda, a TikTok refugee. Amanda, who has started adding Chinese subtitles to her posts, said, “I am so happy to talk to Chinese people and learn about your culture.”For TikTok users like Alexis Garman, the potential ban represents more than losing an app—it’s the loss of a digital community. “TikTok possibly getting banned doesn’t just take away an app, it takes away jobs, friends, and community,” said Garman, a 21-year-old from Oklahoma with nearly 20,000 followers.While Xiaohongshu has welcomed American users, its lack of translation features and the heavy censorship typical of Chinese platforms present challenges. However, for now, the app has become a symbol of resistance and a new hub for cultural exchange as TikTok’s future in the US hangs in the balance.","The Supreme Court is set to rule on a law requiring TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, by January 19 or face a nationwide ban.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move in the memo, describing it as a strategy to “raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.”The layoffs, affecting about 5% of Meta’s 72,400-strong workforce as of September, are part of what Zuckerberg called an “intense year” for the company. Employees in the United States will be notified of their status by February 10, with international employees to be informed later, AFP reported.“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Zuckerberg stated, “but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” He noted that some employees who underperformed in the last period may be retained if there is optimism about their future contributions. Those laid off will receive “generous severance,” the CEO added.The company plans to replace the outgoing employees with new hires later this year.This is not Meta’s first wave of job cuts. The company laid off over 11,000 employees in November 2022 and cut an additional 10,000 jobs in subsequent months.The announcement follows a series of policy shifts at Meta, including the elimination of its US fact-checking program, which had been criticised by conservatives as censorship. Zuckerberg also unveiled changes to content moderation policies, easing restrictions on divisive topics such as immigration and gender while loosening rules on hate speech.Last week, Meta also announced reductions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team and scaled back related programs. The policy changes have drawn praise from Republican figures and criticism from Democrats, with some accusing Zuckerberg of aligning with conservative ideas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast last week, revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.He announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Meta’s shares fell Tuesday following the layoff news, reflecting investor concerns over the company's broader direction."," Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Elon Musk , alleging that the billionaire failed to disclose his ownership of Twitter stock in a timely manner in early 2022, prior to his acquisition of the social media platform.In its suit filed late Tuesday (local time) in Washington's US district court, the SEC claims that as a result of this delay, Musk was able to purchase shares at a lower price, underpaying by at least $150 million, reported the Associated Press.According to the complaint, Musk began accumulating Twitter shares in early 2022 and by March, he owned more than 5 per cent of the company's stock. At this point, he was legally required to disclose his ownership but failed to do so until April 4, 11 days after the deadline.One of Elon Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, gave a statement to Bloomberg, characterising the SEC's legal action as ""an admission"" of their weak position. Spiro defended his client, stating that ""has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is"".Twitter was acquired by Musk in April 2022 and later renamed to X the next year. After signing a deal to acquire the platform, Musk attempted to back out of the agreement, prompting the company to sue him to enforce the acquisition.The SEC has stated that starting in April 2022, it had authorised an investigation into potential violations of securities laws related to Musk's purchases of Twitter stock and his statements and filings with the SEC concerning the company.Prior to filing the lawsuit, the SEC sought a court order to compel Musk to testify as part of the investigation into his acquisition of Twitter.The current SEC chair Gary Gensler is set to step down from his position on January 20, and it remains uncertain whether the new administration will pursue the lawsuit.","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued Elon Musk.

The agency would be responsible for collecting tariffs and other revenues from foreign countries.""For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources,"" Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.He asserting his resolve to create the new department he added, ""We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!The creation of the new agency would require an act of Congress . Republicans currently hold the majority in both the House and Senate.Tariffs, with potential levies of 25% on goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, are a key part of Trump's economic agenda. Trump asserted earlier this month that the nation's substantial prosperity during the Second Industrial Revolution was solely attributed to tariffs. He emphasised that implementing tariffs could eliminate national debt and restore America's financial prosperity.However. economists have expressed skepticism about the tariffs, stating that the costs will be passed on to consumers and considering them an inefficient way for governments to raise money.Democratic politicians opposed the External Revenue Service proposal. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said, ""No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich.""Trump, who openly talked about reducing the size of government, plans to establish a new agency to take on tasks already managed by existing bodies, such as the commerce department and customs and border protection, which oversee duties and revenue collection from other nations.The president-elect has selected two prominent business leaders to spearhead his department of government efficiency (DOGE), a nongovernmental task force dedicated to identifying ways to dismiss federal employees, eliminate programs, and streamline federal regulations.

American creators who post videos on TikTok say the app has been a source of connection, entertainment and information since it became a sensation during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Officials in Washington say they are also concerned that China could use TikTok to spread false information among the 170 million American users.Xiaohongshu means ""little red book"" in Mandarin.

It concludes that the evidence would have been enough to convict Trump at trial, but his imminent return to the presidency, set for Jan. 20, made that impossible.Smith, who has faced relentless criticism from Trump, also defended his investigation. ""The claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,"" Smith wrote in a letter detailing his report.After the release, Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Smith a ""lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the election"". Trump's lawyers called the report a ""politically-motivated attack"" and said releasing it ahead of Trump's return to the White House would harm the presidential transition.Much of the evidence cited in the report has been previously made public. But it includes some new details, such as that prosecutors considered charging Trump with inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol under a US law known as the Insurrection Act. Prosecutors ultimately concluded that such a charge posed legal risks and there was insufficient evidence that Trump intended for the ""full scope"" of violence during the riot, a failed bid by a mob of his supporters to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. The indictment charged Trump with conspiring to obstruct the election certification, defraud the US of accurate election results and deprive US voters of their voting rights.A second section of the report details Smith's case accusing Trump of illegally retaining sensitive national security documents after leaving White House in 2021.The justice department hasn't made that portion public while legal proceedings continue against two Trump associates charged in the case.Smith, who left the justice department last week, dropped both cases against Trump after he won last year's election, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

Representative Greg Steube, the bill's sponsor, said, ""The overwhelming majority believe men don't belong in women's sports. This bill will deliver upon the mandate the American people gave Congress .""Democrats, however, criticized the bill as a dangerous invasion of privacy for young girls and an example of Republicans' ""creepy obsession with your kids' private parts,"" according to representative Jim McGovern. They also pointed out that the legislation targets a small and vulnerable population of transgender children who already face higher rates of bullying and mental health issues.Representative Lori Trahan, the only former division I college athlete serving in Congress, acknowledged legitimate concerns about transgender athletes competing in women's sports at the highest levels but questioned the involvement of politicians in the issue.The decision to bring up the bill in the second week of Congress suggests that Republicans believe the issue remains politically advantageous. During the 2024 presidential election season, the Trump campaign spent a significant portion of its ad budget on television ads addressing transgender issues.Democrats spent more time raising concerns about the bill's potential to infringe upon girls' privacy, arguing that it could lead to invasive questioning about their bodies. Representative Katherine M. Clark said, ""This doesn't protect a girl's rights, it eliminates them. It puts a target on the back of every girl, every young woman who chooses to play sports.""The debate also included disagreements about how the legislation would be enforced, with Republicans suggesting that reviewing birth certificates would suffice, while Democrats argued that this method would be unreliable due to the existence of intersex individuals.Two Democrats, representatives Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, voted in favor of the bill, while representative Don Davis of North Carolina voted ""present.""Last week, a federal judge in Kentucky struck down US President Joe Biden 's effort to expand protections for transgender students and make changes to the rules governing sex discrimination in schools.",US House of Representatives passes bill barring transgender athletes from women's sports teams.

US President Joe Biden has informed Congress of his plan to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. The White House announced that this decision was part of a deal brokered by the Catholic Church to release political prisoners in Cuba.Senior US administration officials, speaking anonymously, said that ""many dozens"" of political prisoners and others considered unjustly detained by the US would be freed by the end of the Biden administration on January 20. The US will also reduce some economic pressure on Cuba and revise a 2017 memorandum issued by former President Donald Trump that toughened the US stance toward the island nation.Cuba said that it will free 553 prisoners following removal from US terror list.However, the decision by the outgoing Democrat president is expected to be reversed soon after Trump, the Republican president-elect, takes office and Marco Rubio becomes secretary of state, according to a report by news agency Associated Press. Rubio, whose family left Cuba before the communist revolution led by Fidel Castro, has long advocated for sanctions against Cuba.In the final days of Trump's first administration, on January 11, 2021, the White House had reinstated Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, citing its support for Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and refusal to extradite Colombian rebels, among other issues.Biden's administration has determined that there is ""no credible evidence"" that Cuba currently supports international terrorism. Congress and the incoming Trump administration will have the opportunity to review and potentially reverse Biden's actions.Representative Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, criticized the move, saying, ""President Biden is a pathetic coward. Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!""",US President Joe Biden has informed Congress of his plan to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.

An Oregon cancer patient's wife has filed a lawsuit against the hospital and doctor, alleging her 'awake' husband's face caught on fire, leaving him permanently disfigured while undergoing a surgery at Oregon Health & Science University as part of his treatment.In December 2022, John Michael Murdoch , a 52-year-old cancer patient, underwent a tracheostomy—a procedure to create a breathing hole in his neck—at Oregon Health & Science University as part of his treatment for tongue cancer. During the procedure, Murdoch's face caught on fire, leaving him permanently disfigured, according to a lawsuit filed by his wife, Toni Murdoch.The lawsuit, which seeks $900,000 in damages, alleges that the surgical staff had sterilized Murdoch's face with isopropyl alcohol, but it hadn’t fully dried when a surgical tool sparked, causing the fire. Murdoch was awake and conscious during the incident.Ron Cheng, the Murdoch family lawyer, told the Oregonian, as quoted by New York Post, ""It never should have happened."" He added that while Murdoch had difficulty speaking, he expressed to his wife the suffering and trauma the burns caused him in his last months.Tragically, Murdoch succumbed to his cancer in June 2023, nearly six months after the surgical fire. The lawsuit claims that he never fully healed from the traumatic and disfiguring incident before his death.The suit also alleges that the tool used during the procedure had a history of throwing off sparks, which, combined with oxygen and the wet alcohol, created a ""fire triangle."" It names Oregon Health & Science University, Dr Adam Howard, and unnamed surgical staff members as defendants.Howard initially obtained his medical license in 2022, but it expired in January 2024 in Oregon, according to New York Post. While he remains listed as an instructor on the hospital's website, West Virginia University featured him in a post on their website from November 2023.The American College of Surgeons warns that perfect conditions for fires exist in operating rooms and urges medical staff to remain vigilant to prevent such incidents. It is estimated that there are 90 to 100 surgical fires yearly in the United States, according to a report by New York Post.","John Michael Murdoch, 52, underwent a tracheostomy at Oregon Health & Science University as part of his treatment for tongue cancer.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation. ""No one from there came to participate in the conference,"" Pakistan's education minister, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said.Malala also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza. ""In Gaza, Israel has decimated the entire education system.

Speaking at a seminar organized by the Health Foundation, Bharath emphasized the critical need for immediate action to combat the public health crisis.""This places us at the heart of the global effort to eliminate this disease,"" Bharath said, highlighting that without intervention, HCV cases in Pakistan could rise to over 11 million by 2035, resulting in more than 500,000 liver cirrhosis cases, over 100,000 liver cancer cases, and 130,000 related deaths.

BALOCHISTAN: Pakistan security forces have been accused of forcibly disappearing three individuals from Balochistan's Kech and Sibi districts.The alleged detentions are part of an ongoing pattern of enforced disappearances in the region, which has raised significant concern among human rights organizations and local communities, as reported by the Balochistan Post.According to the Balochistan Post, Irshad Ahmed, a young man, was allegedly apprehended by Pakistani forces at a medical store in Turbat. He was reportedly taken to an undisclosed location, with his whereabouts remaining unknown.The Balochistan Post further reported that similarly, Nawaz Nadil, a 17-year-old student from the Balochistan Residential College (BRC), was allegedly detained by military personnel at the Gamshad Hotel in Turbat.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said. The Chinese-funded airport was inaugurated by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in October.The airport, Pakistan's largest, is located in restive southwestern Balochistan province and is part of a massive investment by Beijing that links a deep seaport and airport on the Arabian Sea by road with China.","The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.

"Paris, we are coming today: Twitter erupts over post by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-airlines-twitter-pia-paris-9-11/articleshow/117118737.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines' Greatest Hits



Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We’re Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA’s marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there’s Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)—an entity so hilariously unpredictable that it’s essentially become the aviation world’s sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for “divine intervention,” PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline’s X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: “Paris, we are coming today.” The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, “First, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they’re going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!” Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, “PIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‘Final Destination.’” Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, “This marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.”The tweet also reignited memories of PIA’s greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, “First it was goats, now it’s global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.” @cruindggn added, “At this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‘Oops Air’ and own it.” User @saikirankannan chimed in with, “Next stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‘We’re just helping it lean a little more.’”Others couldn’t help but connect the mishap to Pakistan’s controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country’s global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA’s PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet’s imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained—whether it’s on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

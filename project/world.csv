The incident

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , the suspect driver behind the terrorist attack in New Orleans that killed at least 15, acted alone but was inspired by Isis, the FBI revealed.Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, said during a briefing that the New Orleans truck attack was ""an act of terrorism,"" and the attacker was ""100% inspired by Isis,"" although he acted alone. He added that the FBI is confident at this point that Jabbar ""had no accomplices.""Jabbar, who drove a truck into a crowd on New Year’s Eve in New Orleans, killing at least 15 people, had declared his support for Isis online, the FBI announced Thursday. He posted several videos on Facebook, detailing his violent plan and radical thinking as he drove from his home in Texas to Louisiana, according to FBI Raia.Jabbar initially intended to harm his family and friends but altered his plan after becoming worried that the media would not highlight the ""war between the believers and the disbelievers,"" according to Raia.Jabbar posted five videos between 1:30 am and just after 3 am on New Year’s Eve, hours before the attack. In the videos, he claimed to have joined ISIS before the summer. He also left a will and testament, according to the FBI.The attack occurred on Bourbon Street, a popular tourist destination in New Orleans’ French Quarter. While Jabbar initially intended to target his family and friends, he ultimately chose Bourbon Street, and the FBI is still investigating the specific reason behind his choice of location. Police shot and killed Jabbar at the scene.Raia said, as quoted by NBC, “This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” adding that Jabbar acted alone. “He was 100% inspired by Isis.”Raia said security video shows Jabbar placing a cooler with an improvised explosive device on Bourbon Street and another one about two blocks away. The devices did not detonate and were later made safe.According to two senior US law enforcement officials, the bombs, taped inside the coolers, were made from galvanized pipe with end caps and contained nails.The devices also had receivers for remote firing, the officials added. It remains unclear whether Jabbar attempted to detonate them, whether they malfunctioned, or what his exact plan was.“We’re confident at this point that he had no accomplices,” Raia added.Raia said the FBI recovered three cellphones and two laptops linked to Jabbar , and investigators were working to determine the content of the devices.Raia mentioned that the FBI has received over 400 tips from the public, including from New Orleans and other areas, and he encouraged anyone who had interacted with Jabbar to come forward.“We are examining every aspect of his life,” he said. “Whether you knew Jabbar personally, worked with him, served in the military, or saw him in New Orleans or Texas, we need to speak with you.”According to US defense officials, Jabbar served on active duty in the Army from 2006 to 2015 and then in the Army Reserve from 2015 to 2020. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant in 2020.Jabbar had been working for the professional services giant Deloitte in a staff-level role since 2021. He attended Georgia State University from 2015 to 2017 and earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a focus on computer information systems, according to a university spokesperson.Civil records indicate that Jabbar was married twice, with his first marriage ending in 2012 and his second in 2022.A woman who identified herself as Jabbar’s sister-in-law and requested to remain anonymous said his relatives in Texas were shocked upon hearing the news. “It makes ‘no sense,’” she told NBC News on Wednesday. “He’s the nicest person I’ve ever known.”“I really don’t know what happened,” she continued. “He was a good man. He takes care of his children and everything.”Jabbar drove a Ford F-150 Lightning truck, with a black Isis flag attached to its hitch, onto Bourbon Street early Wednesday. He navigated around a ""hard target"" area that included officers, barriers, and a car, before plowing into a crowd of revelers. The attack killed at least 15 people and injured at least 35, according to an NBC report. Jabbar was killed in a gunfight with police officers, two of whom were injured but stable.Investigators believe Jabbar rented the white Ford truck in Houston on Monday and drove it to New Orleans the following evening.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar acted alone but was inspired by Isis, the FBI said.

Germany: Nearly 190 members of far-right groups wanted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-nearly-190-members-of-far-right-groups-wanted/articleshow/116899768.cms,"Why are those suspects wanted?

What are Reichsbürger and Selbstverwalter?

Germany's interior ministry had outstanding arrest warrants against 189 suspects deemed members of far-right groups that do not recognize the modern German state, media group RND reported on Thursday.Authorities said the suspects were part of ""Reichsbürger"" (""citizens of the Reich"") or "" Selbstverwalter "" (""self-administrators"") groups, which claim either to live in the defunct German Empire, or on soil they have unilaterally declared to be independent within Germany.The figure was published on September 30, 2024 in response to a parliamentary request for information from the socialist Left Party.In total, 254 arrest warrants were open against such suspects, the ministry said, with some facing more than one warrant.There were 43 individuals wanted for at least one violent crime, and three accused of several violent crimes.The ministry said 20 of the warrants were for violent political crime, and another 77 for politically motivated non-violent crimes like forgery, coercion or inciting racial violence.It classified the remaining warrants as being for ""the area of general criminality without political motivation.""German authorities believe that more than 20 of the people sought are residing abroad; some of them have been at large for years.Between the end of March and September last year, 93 fresh warrants of this kind were issued against either ""Reichsbürger"" or ""Selbstverwalter,"" the data showed.""Reichsbürger"" typically deny the legitimacy and existence of the modern German state and the 1918 dissolution of the defunct German Empire.Their ideas of what, and where, the German state is are ""directly in opposition to the territorial integrity of our neighboring states and with that against efforts at understanding between nations,"" according to the Interior Ministry.Antisemitism has also often been part of some of the group's members' ideology, the ministry said, in some cases including stances like Holocaust denial.Members of the other group, ""Selbstverwalter,"" claim to see their legal position in Germany similarly, but instead base their argument on their having unilaterally declared their property sovereign and independent.""With their behavior, Selbstverwalter want above all to resist paying taxes and other demands like foreclosures,"" the ministry said.Multiple trials connected to an alleged group of Reichsbürger accused of plotting to violently overthrow the government are ongoing around the country.The most prominent defendant is Heinrich XIII Prince Reus, a descendant of German nobility born a private citizen in 1951. The group are accused of plotting to install him as head of a future state.","Authorities say 189 suspects are members of far-right groups that do not recognize the modern German state.

Double takeoff terror: Watch Nok Air flight fails takeoff twice in dramatic incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/double-takeoff-terror-watch-nok-air-flight-fails-takeoff-twice-in-dramatic-incident/articleshow/116898821.cms,"Representative photo

Passengers aboard Nok Air flight DD176 experienced sheer terror on December 30, when their plane attempted—and failed—takeoff not once, but twice at Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport, reported the Post. The ordeal unfolded just a day after the devastating Jeju Air crash involving the same model, a Boeing 737-800 , that claimed 179 lives in South Korea, adding a chilling layer to the unfolding drama.Narongsak Toyabut, a passenger who filmed the harrowing moments, described the chaos. “The first attempt raised concerns when the engines stalled,” he said. But the second attempt brought full-blown panic. “The engine sounded wrong. The plane sped past the usual takeoff point but didn’t lift. By the second hangar, it suddenly slowed. That’s when we knew something was terribly wrong.”With passengers gripping their seats in fear, the captain announced an engine malfunction and taxied back to the terminal. Toyabut, still visibly shaken, said, “It’s hard to explain the terror. I’m thankful the captain didn’t push the flight. I can’t imagine what would’ve happened mid-air.”Nok Air scrambled to control the fallout, issuing a statement: “Passenger safety is our priority. The aircraft underwent inspection, and a replacement plane was provided, delaying the flight to 7:20 pm. We apologize for the inconvenience.”The timing of this incident couldn’t be more haunting. Just a day earlier, Jeju Air flight 7C2216 from Bangkok to Muan, South Korea, erupted into flames after hitting an embankment during an emergency landing. Investigators are piecing together why the landing gear failed to deploy and what led the pilot to attempt a second landing after reporting a bird strike.For passengers aboard DD176, the close call felt like a brush with fate. The unsettling coincidence of back-to-back incidents involving the Boeing 737-800 leaves travelers questioning the skies and the safeguards meant to protect them.","Passengers aboard Nok Air flight DD176 experienced sheer terror on December 30.

(Photos: New York Post)

A Quran open to violence

A chaotic scene at home

A house of red flags

A veteran’s downfall

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a 42-year-old New Orleans terrorist who pledged allegiance to Isis, left behind a chilling scene in his North Houston trailer home—complete with bomb-making materials , a Quran open to a passage glorifying violence, and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning into the heart of Bourbon Street , mowing down revelers at 3 am in a gruesome rampage. Fourteen people were killed, dozens injured, and Jabbar himself died in a shootout with police. Federal investigators have ruled it an act of terrorism The video posted by the New York Post showed a workbench in Jabbar’s bedroom set up for assembling explosives. Nearby, his Quran stood prominently atop a bookshelf, opened to Verse 9:111, which reads: “They fight in Allah’s cause, and slay and are slain; a promise binding…” The verse, widely interpreted as a call to violence by extremist ideologies, cast a haunting shadow over his already sinister acts.This passage, investigators believe, fueled Jabbar’s radicalization . It was the same ideology he embraced in chilling videos posted online minutes before his attack, where he declared his allegiance to Isis and issued threats, including to his own family.The aftermath of the FBI raid on Jabbar’s trailer painted a picture of a man living on the edge. The home was in disarray, with the front door kicked down, cabinets flung open, and furniture overturned.His main bedroom held a keffiyeh in the closet and bomb-making tools on the workbench—ominous signs of his dark turn. Despite the mess, the home seemed eerily as if he had just left, with clothes and belongings scattered about.Jabbar’s trailer home painted a grim portrait of his descent into extremism . Chemical residues and bottles filled the property, with an inventory left behind by FBI agents listing compounds commonly used in bomb-making. A rolled-up prayer rug and numerous Islamic books further hinted at his radicalization.Yet, the home also bore traces of his fragmented personal life. A back bedroom was cluttered with children’s toys and bunk beds—remnants of his role as a father to two daughters, aged 15 and 20.Hours before his attack, Jabbar told neighbors he was leaving for New Orleans for a new IT job. The lie was soon laid bare as the same white truck he drove off in became his weapon of mass destruction.Once an Army staff sergeant, Jabbar served ten years, including deployments to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2019. But after leaving active duty in 2015 and the reserves in 2020, his life unraveled. Financial woes from two divorces, a failed real estate career, and struggles as an IT specialist marked his civilian years.Despite his quiet demeanor, Jabbar’s radicalization had alarming roots. In videos posted before his attack, he not only declared loyalty to Isis but also threatened to murder his own family. His younger brother, Abdur Jabbar, expressed shock: “This is more some type of radicalization, not religion. He was a sweetheart really, a nice guy, a friend, really smart, caring.”","Shamsud-Din Jabbar left behind bomb-making materials, an open Quran and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.

New Orleans Las Vegas Attack Connection: Did Cybertruck bomber Matthew Livelsberger and New Orleans attacker Shamsud Din Jabbar plan their attacks together?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-cybertruck-bomber-matthew-livelsberger-connected-with-new-orleans-attacker-shamsud-din-jabbar/articleshow/116886726.cms,"Las Vegas cybertruck bomber Matthew Livelsberger, a 37-year-old ex-Army veteran, and Shamsud Din Jabbar, the New Orleans attacker, both served in the same military base. This is not the only connection to the two major attacks that took place on New Year's Day. Both attackers rented their trucks from Turo app for the purpose of carrying out the attacks.

Who was Matthew Livelsberger?



Who was Shamsud Din Jabbar?



Major attacks on New Year: What is still not known?



37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger who blew up a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas had a connection with Shamsud Din Jabbar , the New Orleans attacker , reports claimed citing law enforcement sources who confirmed that both of them served at the same military base Fort Bragg. Jabbar enlisted in the Army in 2007 and Livelsberger was in the Army since 2006. It is not yet known whether the two attacks were also connected.As New Orleans was reeling under the terror attack on New Year's Day, a Tesla cyber truck exploded in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as a former Army veteran of Colorado Springs, Matthew Livelsberger, died in the explosion. Officers have not publicly named Livelsberger as the bomber, but sources confirmed the name to KOAA and KTNV. Livelsberger was an active-duty Army soldier, officials confirmed. Livelsberger spent 18 of his 19-year Army career with the Special Forces, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is believed to have joined the Green Berets as a communication specialist in January 2006, before becoming an operations manager and team sergeant in February 2023. His most recent role, from November 2024, was listed as a Remote and Autonomous Systems Manager for the Army.The truck had a tumble of charred fireworks, mortars, canisters and other explosive devices at the back. It is not yet known how the explosives were detonated.Shamsud Din Jabbar was the New Orleans attacker who plowed his truck through a New Year crowd on famous Bourbon Street killing at least 15 people. After the massacre, he fired at the police officials and died in the brief shootout. He also rented his car from Turo. A Turo spokesperson told Newsweek the company does not believe that ""either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.""Jabbar served almost eight years in the US Army and was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to February 2010. He transferred to the Army Reserve after leaving active duty in January 2015 and then left the reserves as a staff sergeant in July 2020.Apart from their Turo connection, both of them previously served at the same military base, and were in Afghanistan around the same time, reports confirmed.Both the attacks looked intentional, though in the cybertruck explosion, Livelsberger is the only casualty. Law enforcement officials credited Elon Mysk's Tesla as the truck contained a maximum of the damage.Authorities are investigating a possible link between the two men. At the time they were fighting in the Middle East, the US had around 100,000 military personnel in Afghanistan as part of President Barack Obama’s ‘troop surge.’It is not known whether the two incidents had any connection, or whether Livelsberger and Jabbar acted together.FBI said New Orleans attacker Jabbar definitely did not act alone.

Sheikh Mujibur Bahman - 1971

Who was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman



The landmark March 7, 1971 speech by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in our #GreatSpeeches series

The educational curriculum in Bangladesh is undergoing significant changes. The revised textbooks will attribute the declaration of independence in 1971 to Ziaur Rahman instead of ' Bangabandhu ' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman . They have also eliminated Mujib's title as 'Father of the Nation'.""The new textbooks for the 2025 academic year will state that 'on March 26, 1971, Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh, and on March 27, he made another declaration of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu',"" Prof AKM Reazul Hassan, chairman of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, told The Daily Star.The information has been included in the free textbooks where the matter of the declaration was mentioned, he added.Ziaur Rahman established the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and was married to current BNP leader Khaleda Zia. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was the father of recently removed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, spearheaded the country's liberation movement.According to the report, writer and researcher Rakhal Raha, who was involved in the process of making changes in the textbooks, said they tried to free the textbooks from ""exaggerated, imposed history"".""Those who revised the textbooks found that it wasn't fact-based information that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman sent the wireless message [declaring independence] while being arrested by the Pakistani army, and so they decided to remove it.""Previously, the content in textbooks for grades one through 10 regarding the person who made the Declaration of Independence was altered based on whichever political party held power.Awami League supporters strongly maintain that Mujibur Rahman issued the declaration, while Ziaur Rahman, then serving as an Army major and subsequent sector commander during the Liberation War, simply delivered the announcement following Mujib's directives.Previously, Bangladesh initiated steps to remove Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's image from its currency notes during the phase-out of older notes.This action followed the removal of his daughter Sheikh Hasina from her position as prime minister on August 5. As she sought refuge in India, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's statues and murals were vandalised.Earlier, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, decided to cancel eight National Days, including the March 7 and August 15 celebrations which are associated with the country’s Liberation War spearheaded by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.According to Awami League, the decision to cancel the March 7 national holiday, a date that marks Sheikh Mujib’s iconic speech that galvanised the people to fight for independence, was motivated by an ideological rejection of Mujib’s role in the nation’s founding. Similarly, the cancellation of August 15 as National Mourning Day is seen as an attempt to downplay the assassination of Bangabandhu and his family.Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, referred as 'Bangabandhu', served as the inaugural president of independent Bangladesh. His life ended tragically when Bangladesh Army officers executed a coup, raiding his Dhanmondi 32 residence. This incident represented a crucial moment in Bangladesh's political landscape, marking the military's first direct interference in civilian governance. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman served in leadership roles as either president or prime minister from April 1971 until his assassination.His Awami League party achieved overwhelming success in the 1970 general election of united Pakistan, securing virtually all seats in East Pakistan, which subsequently became Bangladesh. Initially serving as Bangladesh's prime minister, he later established one-party rule and assumed the presidency in January 1975. On August 15, within his first year as president, soldiers assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman alongside his wife and three sons.In the ensuing period, commerce minister Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad took control, declaring himself interim government head from August 15, 1975, to November 6, 1975. Ahmad's leadership proved short-lived. On November 3, army chief of staff Khaled Mosharraf led a successful coup against him. Subsequently, rival insurgents killed Mosharraf. After several successive coups and counter-coups, General Ziaur Rahman ultimately gained control on November 7."," textbooks will attribute the declaration of independence in 1971 to Ziaur Rahman instead of'Bangabandhu'Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Police behind the investigation of the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas expressed gratitude towards CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday citing the strong construction of the vehicle body that limited the explosion. Police noted that the attack could have been worse but the vehicle limited the blast and its damage.Speaking to CNN, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said that the structural design of the Cybertruck helped contain the damage in the hotel valet area, directing the explosion's force upwards and preserving the building's front glass windows.""The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast.

Additional social media videos showed the vehicle covered in smoke whilst being extinguished with water.

'Insurance companies only pay for treatment'

An X post of one Dr Zachary Levy has gone viral as the doctor claimed that one of his patients was denied the medical insurance claim by UnitedHealthcare . The patient is in ICU with a brain hemorrhage, in a coma, on a ventilator and in heart failure, the doctor said.""...because I haven't proven to them that caring for her in the hospital was ""medically necessary"". Tear it all down,"" the doctor wrote.The post comes as UnitedHealthcare is the target of public outrage because of its high denial of claims. Its 50-year-old CEO Brian Thompson was killed on December 4 in New York by accused Luigi Mangione, who was hailed as a hero by the disgruntled customers of the insurance company. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was never a customer of UnitedHealthcare but he chose Thompson as his company deemed fit for his target. Mangione's target was insurance -- though he pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.Dr Zachary also posted the letter that he submitted to the company explaining the medical necessity of his patient.""I am writing on behalf of my patient, XXX, to document the medical necessity of being on a ventilator in the intensive care unit for the treatment of their brain hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and respiratory failure. Their treatment was medically necessary to prevent them from dying during this visit,"" the letter said.As the port went viral, many users reacted with their experience with UHC . ""While I was going through stage 3 cervical cancer in 2016 I was denied by @UHC. The reason? They said the result of my diagnosis was due to an accident.

Another said that the incident probably did not even happen and even if it happened, it was probably a bureaucratic error but this should not have kept the patient from getting the care they needed, one said.""I know it's not the doctors arena really, but if prices at hospitals weren't so outrageous, maybe more claims would get approved. System is broken on so many levels,"" one wrote.Recently, an ex-employee of UnitedHealthcare claimed that they were trained on various ways to deny claims while there was no training to clear claims.UnitedHealthcare earlier said it approves and pays about 90 per cent of medical claims upon submission and social media claims about denials were highly inaccurate and grossly misleading.

Candidates with significant physical fitness deficits and questionable academic qualifications are being admitted.

The drug policy for applicants has been “liberalized,” allowing individuals with histories of substance abuse to join the bureau.

Supervisors are pressured to advance candidates who fail basic requirements, including fitness tests and English proficiency, to meet DEI goals.

Conservative Backlash



Broader Implications



A Divided Narrative



The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is under intense scrutiny following the New Orleans New Year’s Day attack, an incident that led to confusion over whether it constituted an act of terrorism. While investigations continue, the controversy has reignited broader debates over the agency’s recruitment standards and the influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives.The New Orleans attack, where a pickup truck plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing and injuring multiple people, was initially categorized by the FBI as non-terroristic. However, the discovery of potential ties to extremist ideologies, including an Islamic State flag attached to the vehicle, prompted the FBI to reclassify the incident as a terrorism investigation.The suspect, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was killed in a confrontation with law enforcement after the attack. Authorities revealed that the truck used in the attack was adorned with a black flag resembling those associated with the Islamic State and contained several improvised explosive devices (IEDs), though their viability is still under investigation. Jabbar’s background has raised additional concerns; he was reportedly on a federal watchlist due to past associations with extremist groups. Investigators are now probing his potential connections to larger networks and whether he acted alone or as part of a coordinated effort.Witnesses described the horrifying scene as the truck veered into the crowd, causing chaos during New Year’s celebrations. Surveillance footage has provided crucial evidence, showing Jabbar’s movements in the hours leading up to the attack. While the motive is still being determined, preliminary findings suggest ideological influences may have played a role.Special Agent Alethea Duncan , one of the FBI’s public faces during the probe, initially stated that the attack did not meet the criteria for terrorism. This apparent flip-flop drew sharp criticism from conservative commentators and social media users, who accused the FBI of attempting to minimize the attack’s severity. The criticism intensified when reports emerged that the agency’s recruitment practices—influenced by DEI policies—may be compromising its effectiveness.The controversy surrounding Special Agent Alethea Duncan has also drawn attention to her nose ring, which some critics have used as a symbol of perceived lax standards within the agency.According to the FBI’s official dress and appearance guidelines, agents are expected to maintain a professional appearance that aligns with the bureau’s mission. While there is no outright ban on nose rings, such accessories are typically discouraged in field operations or high-visibility roles to ensure uniformity and professionalism. Exceptions may be granted based on cultural or religious grounds, reflecting broader DEI policies aimed at inclusivity.Under the leadership of FBI Director Christopher Wray , DEI initiatives have been central to the agency’s efforts to diversify its workforce. According to a report submitted to the House Judiciary Committee, these initiatives prioritize race, gender, and sexual orientation over traditional qualifications such as physical fitness, integrity, and experience. Critics argue that this shift undermines the FBI’s mission to protect national security.The report, compiled by an alliance of active-duty and retired FBI agents, paints a grim picture of recruitment practices. It alleges that:Right-wing commentators and politicians have seized on these allegations to critique the FBI’s priorities. Figures like Miranda Devine of the New York Post argue that DEI mandates are diluting the FBI’s quality and effectiveness, prioritizing political correctness over competence.Social media has amplified these concerns, with users highlighting cases from the report that describe candidates being pushed through despite serious disqualifications. For example, one account mentions an applicant rejected by local police but later hired by the FBI under non-special-agent roles. Another recounts an overweight recruit being advanced despite failing physical fitness standards.The controversy over DEI in the FBI is emblematic of larger cultural battles within the United States. Proponents of DEI argue that a diverse workforce strengthens the FBI by bringing varied perspectives and fostering trust with historically underrepresented communities. Critics counter that these policies prioritize ideology over competence, risking national security.The alliance of whistleblowers warns that the current trajectory could lead to “generational failure” within the bureau. They have called for an audit of FBI recruitment practices and demanded congressional oversight to ensure that recruitment standards are aligned with national security priorities.The uproar over Alethea Duncan’s handling of the New Orleans attack highlights the challenges facing the FBI in balancing operational transparency with public relations. Right-wing critics frame Duncan’s role—and her visible nose ring—as symbolic of the “woke” culture they believe has infiltrated the agency. Others see this focus as a distraction from the substantive issues surrounding the attack and the FBI’s response. As the FBI continues its investigation into the New Orleans attack, the agency faces mounting pressure to address criticisms of its recruitment and training practices. For its detractors, the debate over DEI is not merely about hiring policies but about the FBI’s ability to fulfill its core mission: safeguarding the nation. Whether the FBI can navigate this contentious terrain without losing public trust remains to be seen.","The FBI is under intense scrutiny following the New Orleans New Year’s Day attack.

Call for justice continues

In the past 24 hours, social media platform X has become the battleground for a heated debate on the alleged grooming gangs scandal in the UK. Public figures including Elon Musk , JK Rowling , and former Prime Minister Liz Truss have joined a growing chorus of voices demanding accountability over the UK's handling of child sexual abuse cases, particularly focusing on the Rotherham scandal that occurred between 1997 and 2013.Over a period spanning years, the Yorkshire town of Rotherham experienced one of Britain's most severe child exploitation cases. An independent inquiry found that no fewer than 1,400 minors were victimized through systematic abuse. The majority of victims were young girls who were targeted, manipulated, and trafficked by organized groups of men, most of whom were of Pakistani background.The crimes were compounded by institutional failures - despite victims repeatedly coming forward, law enforcement and social services consistently failed to take appropriate action or protect the children. The perpetrators used a combination of psychological manipulation, intimidation, and physical violence to maintain control over their victims.The debate intensified after Tesla CEO Elon Musk directly challenged current Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's role in these cases, pointing to his tenure as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) from 2008 to 2013. ""Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice?"" Musk posted on social media platform X.Author JK Rowling weighed in on the controversy, taking issue with the terminology used to describe these crimes. She condemned the actions of the perpetrators and questioned whether there had been police corruption in the cases, referencing an article in The Telegraph by journalist Sam Ashworth-Hayes.Rowling wrote, ""The details emerging about what the rape gangs (why call them 'grooming' gangs? It's like calling those who stab people to death 'knife owners') did to girls in Rotherham are downright horrific. The allegations of possible police corruption in the case are almost beyond belief.""She described the emerging details about the Rotherham cases as ""downright horrific"" and expressed alarm at allegations of police corruption.The author’s blunt language echoed a sentiment that has become increasingly common among critics of the grooming gang scandal—redefining the term “grooming gangs” to emphasize the severity of the crimes.Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss also spoke out, condemning the perpetrators and the authorities who allowed the crimes to continue. In her post, she remarked, “These appalling rape gang cases of girls as young as 11 shame our country. Not only do the perpetrators need to be punished. So do the authorities who turned a blind eye in the name of not inflaming racial tensions.”Truss added, “The horrific failings on rape gangs show the complete lack of accountability in British criminal justice. The proper role of Lord Chancellor needs to be restored (to its pre-2005 state), and the judiciary should be accountable to them.”Truss emphasized the need for reform, saying that ministers should be able to hire and fire senior Home Office civil servants and police officers. According to her, the government must take responsibility and act to fix the country's justice system.Elon Musk, never one to shy away from controversy, has called out UK officials over the scandal, accusing them of failing to address the widespread abuse of young girls. Musk specifically pointed to current Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) between 2008 and 2013. In a tweet, Musk wrote: ""In the UK, serious crimes such as rape require the Crown Prosecution Service's approval for the police to charge suspects. Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice? Keir Starmer, 2008 -2013.""The Tesla CEO’s criticism didn’t stop there. He also posted a message in support of Tommy Robinson , a British journalist and activist currently incarcerated, who has long been a vocal critic of the grooming gangs. Robinson had previously released a documentary detailing the extent of the abuse, which he alleges was covered up by authorities. Musk shared a tweet that read, “Free Tommy Robinson!” further amplifying the calls for justice.Tommy Robinson's official handle on X shared a tragic story about a victim, Nicole, who was allegedly raped and pimped out by a grooming gang at the age of 11 in Telford.Robinson's team, representing him on X while he remains in prison, continued to raise awareness about the issue.One post shared the heartbreaking story of a girl named Nicole, who was allegedly raped and trafficked at the age of 11 by members of a grooming gang in Telford, a city notorious for such crimes. The post condemned the authorities for their failure to intervene, noting that Robinson is ""languishing in solitary confinement in a high-security prison"" for exposing these abuses.The post read: “Nicole was raped and pimped at the age of 11 by members of a grooming gang in Telford, one of many, many cases in that area. A man is languishing in solitary confinement in a high-security prison because he dared to speak out and tell the truth about this scourge—the industrialised rape, pimping, and molestation of little girls by depraved adult men.”Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe also joined the conversation, sharing his fury over the scandal. He posted on X, “Reading these transcripts, these graphic descriptions—I am just so furious that our country allowed this to happen to those vulnerable young girls. It’s not ‘grooming’ gangs, it’s rape gangs—mass rape gangs. It makes me ashamed to be British.”Lowe further called for drastic action, urging for the deportation of foreign nationals involved in the abuse. “We must deport all foreign nationals involved in the rape gangs—stripping citizenship from dual nationals, and deporting them too,” he said.Newark MP Robert Jenrick, speaking as a father of girls the same age as the victims, also condemned the perpetrators. He pledged to continue his campaign for life sentences and the prosecution of all those involved in covering up the crimes.The alleged grooming gang scandal has its roots in incidents that took place between 1997 and 2013 in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where hundreds of girls were sexually exploited by gangs of men. On September 13, 2024, the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that seven men were jailed for committing child sex abuse offenses against two young girls in Rotherham during the 2000s.The case was part of Operation Stovewood, a major investigation by the National Crime Agency into child sexual abuse and exploitation in the town. The two victims in this case were just 11 and 15 years old when the abuse began.The CPS prosecution included Mohammed Amar (42), Mohammed Siyab (44), Yasser Ajaibe (39), Mohammed Zameer Sadiq (49), Abid Saddiq (43), Tahir Yassin (38), and Ramin Bari (37). These convictions were seen as a small step forward in bringing justice to the victims, but the scandal remains a dark stain on the UK’s history, with many feeling that authorities failed to act swiftly enough.As calls for justice continue to grow, it remains to be seen whether the UK government will take further action to address the systemic failures that allowed the grooming gangs to thrive for so long. MPs and celebrities are using their platforms to demand accountability, but the question remains: how many more vulnerable girls have been affected, and what will be done to prevent further exploitation?","Elon Musk and JK Rowling lead calls for justice over Pakistani grooming gangs.

DENVER: A gray wolf in Colorado was illegally shot and later died of the injury, federal authorities said Thursday in the latest flashpoint of Colorado's controversial, voter-driven initiative to reintroduce the predators to the state.Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock. The first 10 wolves were released a year ago, and since then there have been over two dozen claims of depredations - when wolves kill livestock or working dogs.The wolf was part of the Copper Creek Pack which was captured in late August after the pack repeatedly killed local livestock in Grand County, just northwest of Denver, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf died in early September and the investigation is ongoing.Officials said the wolf was found in poor condition, emaciated with injuries to its right hind leg, which a necropsy revealed was caused by the gunshot wound. Wolves are protected under the Endangered Species Act in the state, and it's a federal crime to kill, injure or harass them without federal authority.Colorado officials anticipate releasing 30 to 50 wolves within the next five years with the goal of filling one of the last major holes in the western US for the species, which in years past has ranged from northern Canada to the desert southwest.","Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock.

'A body came flying at me'

The bustling celebration of New Year’s Eve on Bourbon Street turned into a scene of terror when a speeding SUV, driven with apparent malicious intent, barreled onto the sidewalk, sending revelers scattering for their lives.In a chilling incident captured on video, the SUV was seen mounting the sidewalk outside a Krystal's burger restaurant around 3:15 am, narrowly missing a woman by inches as others scrambled to safety. Some darted into the street, while others sought refuge inside the fast-food joint. Miraculously, no injuries were reported, though the sheer chaos and panic reverberated through the French Quarter.Eyewitnesses described the sound of screeching tires and what appeared to be gunshots in the background, adding to the atmosphere of fear. The manager of the restaurant confirmed that no staff members were present at the time of the incident.The driver, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar , was later revealed to have swerved around makeshift barriers before plowing into the crowded area. Authorities confirmed that Jabbar’s rampage was a deliberate terror attack, leaving 15 dead and dozens injured.Witnesses reported the white pickup truck barreling through a barricade before careening into pedestrians on the crowded sidewalk.“All I saw was a truck slamming into everyone on the left side of Bourbon sidewalk,” recalled Kevin Garcia, 22, who narrowly avoided being struck. “A body came flying at me,” he said, his voice still shaking. Moments later, gunshots rang out as the driver exited the vehicle and engaged in a gunfight with law enforcement.Amid the pandemonium, Nicole Mowrer and her husband Jim sought refuge in a nearby alcove. “We heard gunfire, saw police running that direction,” she recounted. When the shooting ceased, they ventured into the street only to find bodies and injured victims strewn across the pavement.Authorities acted swiftly to secure the area and evacuate survivors, urging bystanders to put away their phones and leave immediately. “Police waved us where to walk and told us to get out fast,” said Whit Davis, 22, from Shreveport. “I saw a few dead bodies they couldn’t even cover up and tons of people receiving first aid.”By dawn, the scale of the carnage became clear. The New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) confirmed the incident as a mass casualty event, with the injured rushed to five local hospitals. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described the driver as “hellbent on creating carnage and damage,” though authorities have not yet confirmed whether the attack was deliberate.Paul Mauro, a former NYPD inspector, emphasized the growing threat of vehicle-based attacks , stating, “A 5,000-pound truck at high speed causes utter devastation. Some of the worst crime scenes you’ll ever work as a cop or EMT are vehicle accidents.” Mauro urged law enforcement to prioritize such threats as part of their standard operating procedures.","A speeding SUV, driven with apparent malicious intent, barreled onto the sidewalk, sending revelers scattering for their lives.

Billionaire Elon Musk added fuel to the fire by responding to online speculation with a cryptic comment: ""Good question.""The controversy centers on Matthew Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar , two veterans who reportedly served at Fort Bragg and were later implicated in violent incidents . Livelsberger, a Green Beret with 19 years of service, was connected to a Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas.Jabbar, who also served in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, was linked to an attack in New Orleans. Their overlapping service at Fort Bragg has raised questions about whether the base's environment or psychological operations may have influenced their actions.Adding to the intrigue, both veterans reportedly supported former President Donald Trump, leading to theories of a broader psychological or political operation. Critics have pointed to Fort Bragg's history of collaboration with the CIA and its involvement in high-level psychological training programs as potential factors.Further complicating the narrative is the mention of Ryan Routh , who visited Fort Bragg over 100 times before attempting to assassinate Trump. Routh's connections, along with Livelsberger and Jabbar's actions, have sparked speculation about a network of radicalized individuals with ties to the base.Fort Bragg's role as a training ground for psychological operations has led some to question whether its personnel are more susceptible to manipulation or if its selection process targets individuals prone to radicalization.

Trump's statements come after a pickup truck drove into a crowd, killing at least 15 people in New Orleans, and an explosion occurred outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday.Trump posted on Truth Social that, under Biden's ""Open Borders Policy,"" he had repeatedly warned during rallies and elsewhere that radical Islamic terrorism and other forms of violent crime would become so severe in America that it would be difficult to imagine or believe. He claimed that this time had arrived and was worse than anticipated.“With the Biden ‘Open Border’s Policy’ I said, many times during Rallies, and elsewhere, that Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe.

He claimed this was the result of open borders and weak, ineffective, and virtually nonexistent leadership. Trump alleged that the DOJ, FBI, and Democrat state and local prosecutors had failed to do their jobs, describing them as incompetent and corrupt, and accused them of unlawfully targeting him as a political opponent instead of focusing on protecting Americans from violent individuals who had infiltrated the government and the nation.“Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!

Investigators seized more than 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices when they searched the home of Brad Spafford northwest of Norfolk in December, the prosecutors said in a motion filed on Monday.The prosecutors wrote that this is believed to be ""the largest seizure by number of finished explosive devices in FBI history"".Most of the bombs were found in a detached garage at the home in Isle of Wight County, along with tools and bomb-making materials including fuses and pieces of plastic pipe, according to court documents.The prosecutors also wrote: ""Several additional apparent pipe bombs were found in a backpack in the home's bedroom, completely unsecured,"" in the home he shares with his wife and two young children.Spafford, 36, was charged with possession of a firearm in violation of the National Firearms Act. Law enforcement officers allege he owned an unregistered short barrel rifle. Prosecutors said that he faces ""numerous additional potential charges"" related to the explosives.Defence attorneys argued in a motion on Tuesday that authorities haven't produced evidence that he was planning violence, also noting that he has no criminal record. Further, they question whether the explosive devices were usable because ""professionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them"".""There is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,"" the defence lawyers wrote.Messages were left Wednesday seeking further comment from the defence lawyers who signed the motion, Lawrence Woodward and Jerry Swartz.The investigation began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend, told authorities Spafford had disfigured his hand in 2021 while working on homemade explosives.Prosecutors said he only has two fingers on his right hand. The informant told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president, an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, for target practice and that ""he believed political assassinations should be brought back,"" prosecutors wrote.Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on December 17. The agents located the rifle and the explosive devices, some of which had been hand-labelled as ""lethal"" and some of which were loaded into a wearable vest, court documents state. Technicians detonated most of the devices on site because they were deemed unsafe to transport, though several were kept for analysis.At a hearing Tuesday, federal Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard determined that Spafford could be released into house arrest at his mother's home but agreed to keep him detained while the government files further arguments.In response, prosecutors reiterated why they believe Spafford is dangerous, writing that ""while he is not known to have engaged in any apparent violence, he has certainly expressed interest in the same, through his manufacture of pope bombs marked lethal his possession of riot gear and a vest loaded with pipe bombs, his support for political assassinations and use of the pictures of the President for target practice"".",Federal agents found one of the largest stockpiles of homemade explosives they have ever seized when they arrested a Virginia man on a firearms charge last month.

'Walkable' New York City became deadlier for pedestrians in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/walkable-new-york-city-became-deadlier-for-pedestrians-in-2024/articleshow/116897983.cms,"NEW YORK: Many New Yorkers believe the city is best appreciated on foot. But the teeming streets - packed with cars, bikes and a growing number of other vehicles - became increasingly hostile to pedestrians in 2024, city statistics show.In July, a 51-year-old man was killed by a driver who ran a red light in Harlem. In Oct, Felix Mendez, a 49-year-old Mexican immigrant, was killed by a driver while he waited at an intersection in Brooklyn at 3am. On Christmas Day, a taxi driver hit six pedestrians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Manhattan.Overall, in 2024 there was a nearly 18% surge in pedestrian deaths, which jumped to 119 through Dec. 30 from 101 during the same time period in 2023.""Every single New Yorker is a pedestrian; we are the most walkable city in the US and the overwhelming number of any New Yorkers' trips are on foot,"" said Philip Miatkowski, the interim deputy executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that tracks traffic fatalities. ""So, to see any increase like that is definitely alarming and something we need to take seriously.""Leaders in New York have been searching for ways to improve pedestrian safety. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed legislation this year known as ""Sammy's Law,"" which gave the city the authority to lower the speed limit to 20 miles per hour on almost all streets. It was named after Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a boy who died after he was hit by a van in Brooklyn in 2013. The city added 51km of protected bike lanes in 2023 and more in 2024, and has widened existing bike lanes, the Transportation Department said. The city has also installed more than 1.4 million square feet of pedestrian space over the last three years and has redesigned streets, including Queens Boulevard and 96th Street in Manhattan.Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director for Riders Alliance, a transit advocacy organization, said the city needed to more rapidly deploy solutions, such as bus lanes; curb extensions; raised crosswalks; concrete dividers that narrow driving lanes and make it harder to take wide turns; and other ""three-dimensional obstacles"". ""Clearly, as New Yorkers are getting out more and more, we're not as safe on the streets as we should be,"" Pearlstein said.","In 2024 there was a nearly 18% surge in pedestrian deaths, which jumped to 119 through Dec. 30 from 101 during the same time period in 2023.

Are Tesla truck blast in Vegas & attack in New Orleans linked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/are-tesla-truck-blast-in-vegas-attack-in-new-orleans-linked/articleshow/116897712.cms,"LAS VEGAS: One person was killed and at least seven were injured after a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday morning, the authorities said. Gasoline canisters and large firework mortars were packed into the Cybertruck that burst into flames shortly after a driver intentionally drove a pickup truck into crowds celebrating the new year in the French Quarter of New Orleans, killing 14 people. The FBI is investigating whether there is any connection between the Cybertruck explosion and the truck attack, officials said.The sole occupant of the Cybertruck was found dead inside. Two officials, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity, identified the man as Matthew Livelsberger . Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners, the army said in a statement. He had served in the army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the army said. He was awarded two Bronze Stars, including one with a valour device for courage under fire. Livelsberger was on approved leave when he died, it said.Both Livelsberger and New Orleans suspect Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, an army veteran from Texas, spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive army base in North Carolina that is home to multiple special units. However, one official said there was no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. Jabbar enlisted in army in 2007 and Livelsberger in 2006.Officials have not established a link between the events beyond superficial similarities: Both men chose soft targets on New Year's Day and rented trucks through the same budget car rental app, Turo. ""Law enforcement, intelligence community are investigating"" the Las Vegas explosion, ""including whether there is any possible connection to the attack in New Orleans,"" Prez Biden said. It reflected the heightened sense of alarm among law enforcement officials who are probing if the New Orleans attack involved a larger cell of IS sympathisers.Later on Thursday, Christopher Raia of FBI's counterterrorism division said there was no ""definitive connection"" between the two incidents. But he cautioned that investigators are early in their inquiry and have not ruled anything out.Clips taken by witnesses inside and outside the Las Vegas hotel showed the vehicle exploding and flames pouring out of it, as it sat outside the hotel at around 8.40am local time Wednesday. A Trump spokesman didn't respond. The Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas is part of the Trump Organisation, the company of Prez-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House on Jan. 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a key ally of Trump. ""Obviously a Cybertruck, the Trump hotel - there's lots of questions that we have to answer,"" Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said.Police said the truck was rented in Colorado, arrived in Las Vegas at around 7.30am and drove through the city's famed Strip, lined with hotels, casinos and entertainment venues, until it reached the hotel, where it stopped in the valet area. ""Detectives found gasoline canisters and large firework mortars in the bed of the truck,"" a police statement said. Musk said the blast was unrelated to 2024 model-year Cybertruck. ""The explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb,"" he wrote on X. ""All vehicle telemetry was positive."" Telemetry is automatic collection of data from remote sources for analysis. Turo said it didn't believe either renter ""had a criminal background that would've identified them as threat.""","The sole occupant of the Cybertruck was found dead inside.

'Matt was a supersoldier, could have made sophisticated explosives'



Did the gunshot cause the explosion?



'Everyone thought the world of Matt'



37-year-old Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger who shot himself in the head before his Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas was a big supporter of Donald Trump and voted for him in November, his uncle Dean Livelsberger told the Independent. As Livelsberger chose a spot linked to President-elec Donald Trump and a car manufactured by Trump's aide Elon Musk, the FBI is not dismissing any political motivation but the report claimed that, if anything, the bomber was a fan of Trump -- and a registered Republican.Livelsberger was a Rambo-type., 100 per cent patriot, his uncle who was also in the Army said. “He used to have all patriotic stuff on Facebook, he was 100 percent loving the country,” Dean said. “He loved Trump, and he was always a very, very patriotic soldier, a patriotic American. It’s one of the reasons he was in Special Forces for so many years. It wasn’t just one tour of duty.”When Dean Livelsberger was interviewed, he was aware of the Las Vegas explosion but not of his nephew's connection with this. He was bewildered and said it did not make any sense that a skilled warrior and a patriot like Matt would cause an explosion like this -- an amateurish construction.“Matt was a very skilled warrior, and he would be able to make — if it was him, and if he did this — he would’ve been able to make a more sophisticated explosive than using propane tanks and camping fuel. He was what you might call a ‘supersoldier.’ If you ever read about the things he was awarded, and the experience he had, some of it doesn’t make sense, when he had the skills and ability to make something more, let’s say, ‘efficient.’ His skills were enormous from what he had been taught in the military.”Several questions remain unanswered as new details emerge in the case that Matthew Livelsberger shot himself in his head before the explosion. The explosion occurred immediately after the suicide. His motive is not clear. It is not confirmed whether he wanted to end his life and the explosion was an accident after the shooting.Livelsberger’s military ID and passport were found inside the Cybertruck, as well as a Desert Eagle .50 caliber semi-automatic pistol and an SLR Rifleworks B30. Both weapons, and Livelsberger himself, were burnt almost beyond recognition, police said. Investigators also recovered a cache of fireworks, along with an iPhone, a smartwatch, and several credit cards in Livelsberger’s name.The firearms were legally purchased on December 30.His uncle said Livelsberger was not estranged from his family and he just had a newborn with his partner. Livelsberger divorced his first wife several years ago who now lives in South Florida with her new husband. Livelsberger has a new partner and the two have a child.","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, shot himself in the head before his Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.

Matthew Livelsberger's Donald Trump-Elon Musk connection



Was Vegas Cybertruck explosion a suicide incident?



37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger , a military man, who was found dead as a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, shot himself in the head before the truck exploded. Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters that there was a self-inflicted gunshot wound on his head. A gun was found in the destroyed vehicle. The body was badly burnt and it was unrecognizable.""The individual had sustained a gunshot wound to the head prior to the detonation of the vehicle. One of the handguns was found at his feet inside of the vehicle..."" police said.The Cybertruck incident was initially thought of as a terror attack as it took place hours after the New Orleans mass carnage. The two incidents had eerie links like both the suspected attackers rented their trucks on Turo; both served in the Army; the Cybertruck man was still in the Army when he died; and once they served in the same military base. However, the FBI clarified that the New Orleans ISIS man acted alone. But investigators have not yet found the real nature of the Cybertruck explosion.FBI special agent Spencer Evans said that the FBI was looking into the possibility that the attack was politically motivated given that it occurred at a hotel owned by president-elect Donald Trump and with a vehicle from Trump-ally Elon Musk. “It’s not lost on us that it happened in front of the Trump building and a Tesla vehicle was used,” Evans said.So far, law enforcement does not believe Livelsberger had any help carrying out the explosion, with surveillance cameras tracking him all alone on his trip from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas.Matthew Livelsberger has been in the Army since 2006 and was a Special Forces soldier with drone pilot training. On the day of the explosion, he was an active Army man with his latest role from November 2024 being a Remote and Autonomous Systems Manager for the Army.As more details about his education and military career emerged, several questions cropped up on the nature of the explosion. The explosive materials that were found inside his car were all combustible but they were not effective for a large-scale explosion. With his military and technical knowledge, Livelsberger was supposed to know that a Tesla cybertruck would minimise the effect of the explosion. It is not yet known whether Livelsberger chose cybertruck for that very reason as he did not probably want anyone else to be affected.","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was found dead as a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.

The data highlights severe air quality issues in Pakistan, significantly threatening public health.Lahore, home to over 11 million people, continues to grapple with dire air pollution, largely attributed to vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning, The Express Tribune reported.The smog crisis has led to widespread respiratory ailments, with recent figures revealing over 1.8 million individuals have fallen ill in the past month due to smog-related issues. Of these, approximately 1,29,229 have required hospital treatment for respiratory conditions, while 61,00,153 have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions, underscoring the grave health impacts.In Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and bustling economic hub, the AQI of 164 reflects persistent pollution from heavy traffic, industrial zones, and port activities. Despite initiatives to curb pollution, the city remains in the “unhealthy” category, raising concerns for residents, especially those with pre-existing health conditions.Yasir Hussain, director of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), emphasised the role of vehicular emissions in exacerbating air pollution during a press conference at the Karachi Press Club. He noted that vehicle emissions are responsible for 60 per cent of Karachi’s pollution and 80 per cent of Lahore’s, with both cities experiencing severe environmental and health consequences.The air quality crisis has coincided with a measles outbreak in the region, further straining healthcare systems. Doctors have warned of the disease’s high contagion rate and urged parents to ensure timely vaccinations for children aged between nine months and 1.5 years to prevent fatalities.Lahore’s hazardous air pollution has prompted authorities to consider stricter measures, while experts have highlighted the need for regional cooperation to tackle the transboundary nature of air pollution.","Lahore has been ranked as the world’s most polluted city, with an AQI of 354 classified as “hazardous,” while Karachi is listed 13th with an “Unhealthy” AQI.

One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery. He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116842932,imgsize-935512,width-400,resizemode-4/116842932.jpg"
Pak PM Sharif unveils national economic plan to transform country in next 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-sharif-unveils-national-economic-plan-to-transform-country-in-next-5-years/articleshow/116838721.cms,"Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday unveiled a national plan for fast-track economic development aiming to transform the country in the next five years. The ' Uraan Pakistan ' five-year National Economic Transformation plan is aimed at steering the country towards sustainable growth from macroeconomic stability, the premier said while addressing the launching ceremony here.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader said the government has set an investment target of USD 10 billion annually and an enabling environment is being created to attract local investments as well.Sharif said privatisation and outsourcing are vital to save huge losses for which political dialogue is necessary and for which the private sector will be encouraged""Today is a historic day as we commence the journey of Uraan Pakistan,"" he said, and added that the purpose of the programme is development and it is important that all stakeholders work together.The prime minister credited the public for enduring economic hardships and pledged to build on the current stability, describing it as ""only the beginning"".Sharif also criticised the previous government for straining relations with ""friendly nations"", stating that their conduct left Pakistan isolated on the global stage.He outlined goals for economic reforms, expressing hope that Pakistan's current agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be its last.""Through hard work, we can achieve success. Inflation has visibly decreased and the collaboration between the government and institutions continues to strengthen,"" he said.The prime minister stressed on the need for reducing the cost of inputs like electricity and gas to ensure sustainable growth. He said local industries should be made more compatible to save foreign exchange and expand exports, emphasising that export-led growth is the only option to make Pakistan a stronger economy.He also highlighted the coalition government's struggle to stabilise the economy during Pakistan's 2023 financial crisis.""When we were on the brink of default and striving for the IMF programme, we decided to prioritise saving the state over politics,"" he said.Praising the collaboration between government institutions, he said, ""I have never seen such a partnership before. My prayer is for this unity to endure as we move forward with solidarity and determination, learning from past mistakes.""Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said ""Uraan Pakistan"" aims at attaining a sustainable GDP growth rate of six per cent by 2028, one million jobs annually, and ten billion dollars private investment per year.He said this plan is accompanied by a comprehensive implementation mechanism to hit the export target of 60 billion dollars by fiscal year 2028.He added that PM Sharif established a delivery unit at the prime minister's office (PMO) to coordinate the implementation of sectoral plans and roadmaps.""Pakistan recorded a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, reduced inflation from 38 per cent to 5 per cent and improved the policy rate from 13 per cent to 22 per cent. The stock market is now the second-best performing globally, and investor confidence - both local and foreign - has surged,"" he said.Aurangzeb emphasised that the programme is laying the groundwork for sustainable economic growth, adding, ""This is a turning point for the nation's economic stability.""Radio Pakistan reported that Uraan Pakistan is built on pillars of 5Es, entailing exports, e-Pakistan, environment, including food and water security, energy and infrastructure as well as equity, ethics and empowerment.The plan would place Pakistan on a path of sustainable high growth moving towards a stronger and more prosperous future with the commitment to build a solid foundation to transform Pakistan into a trillion dollar economy by 2035 and a three trillion dollar economy by 2047.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif unveils national plan for fast-track economic development.

"Pakistan's textile exports face setback, fall short of $17 billion amid political instability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-textile-exports-face-setback-fall-short-of-17-billion-amid-political-instability/articleshow/116833378.cms,"Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum, as per The Express Tribune.2024 has been a challenging year for this crucial sector, often referred to as the backbone of the nation's industrial economy.In the fiscal year 2023-24, textile exports saw a modest growth of 0.93 per cent, generating a substantial USD 16.7 billion in export revenues. However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion. Industry millers anticipate that the December figure could be approximately USD 1.5 billion, resulting in the year ending with exports falling short of USD 17 billion.Ijaz Khokhar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan-textile-exports, stated, ""The early months of this calendar year were relatively good for the textile industry, particularly exports, as they showed a positive trend.""The positive trend started to decline after the initial months. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil. Waqas Hanif, a mid-sized textile miller from Lahore, said, ""Textile millers in Pakistan should have fully taken advantage of the opportunity created by the political change in Bangladesh. However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week.Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

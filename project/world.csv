‘For hiding Epstein & ...’: Sacramento ABC shooting accused left notes targeting Trump aides; political motive suspected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/for-hiding-epstein-sacramento-abc-shooting-accused-left-notes-targeting-trump-aides-political-motive-suspected/articleshow/124081547.cms,"Representative image





A man accused of firing bullets into the Sacramento ABC affiliate’s offices last week had handwritten notes in his car that threatened members of the Trump administration, according to federal officials.Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, is charged with multiple firearms offences and interference with a federally licensed radio or communications station after the Sept. 19 incident at ABC10 in California’s capital.No one was injured, but employees had to shelter in place and halt operations temporarily.Authorities said that after Hernandez Santana posted bail on Saturday, police searched his car and found a note reading, “For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags. Do not support Patel, Bongino, & AG Pam Bondi. They’re next. – CK from above”, as per Fox News.Prosecutors said the reference to “CK” appeared to be a nod to conservative activist Charlie Kirk , recently killed by a sniper in Utah. Police also discovered a book titled “The Cult of Trump” in his vehicle.According to news agency AP, Hernandez Santana was initially booked on state charges, including shooting into an occupied building, assault with a deadly weapon and negligent discharge of a firearm.He faces federal charges for discharging a firearm within a school zone and interfering with a communications station, which carry up to five years in prison.District Attorney Thien Ho also noted that under the date of the shooting, the suspect had written in a planner, “Do the Next Scary Thing”.Hernandez Santana, a retired lobbyist born in Puerto Rico, was not registered with any political party, according to state voting records. Ho said the attack appeared politically motivated, citing both the notes and the context of recent national events, including protests at the station over late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension and remarks about Charlie Kirk.Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli criticised Hernandez Santana’s initial release on bail, posting on X, “Welcome to California, where someone can commit attempted murder and be back on the streets the same day”.Meanwhile, Hernandez Santana’s lawyer Mark Reichel described the case as “highly unusual” and emphasised his client’s right to due process, stating, “He is innocent unless and until he is found otherwise”.FBI Director Kash Patel also condemned the attack on X and wrote, “Targeted acts of violence are unacceptable and will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law”.Authorities said Hernandez Santana fired four times at the ABC station — once near the building and three times at the lobby window.Sacramento police said the station was clearly not a random target and prosecutors plan to seek to hold him without bail in federal court.","Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, is charged with multiple firearms offences and interference with a federally licensed radio or communications station.

"Reversal move: After layoffs and cuts, Trump admin brings back hundreds – Here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reversal-move-after-layoffs-and-cuts-trump-admin-brings-back-hundreds-heres-why/articleshow/124081189.cms,"



Hundreds of federal employees who were dismissed during Elon Musk’s cost-cutting campaign are being asked to return to work, with the General Services Administration (GSA) issuing recall notices that give them until the end of the week to accept or decline. Those who agree will resume duty on October 6 after what has amounted to a seven-month paid absence, according to an internal memo reviewed by the Associated Press.“Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. “They didn’t have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”The reversal highlights the strain on the GSA, which manages thousands of federal workplaces and was a prime target of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Agencies including the IRS, Labor Department and National Park Service have also reinstated staff in recent weeks after downsizing moves proved disruptive.Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees resigned or took early retirement offers. Hundreds more were dismissed outright as part of aggressive staff reductions, yet some continued to draw salaries. While the agency has not disclosed the cost of its reversal, Democrats argue the downsizing yielded no tangible savings.Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona, the top Democrat overseeing the GSA, said: “It’s created costly confusion while undermining the very services taxpayers depend on.”DOGE had identified GSA as a central focus of its campaign against waste and fraud. Musk’s aides embedded at GSA headquarters sought to cancel nearly half of the agency’s 7,500 leases and sell hundreds of federally owned buildings. At one stage, more than 800 lease termination notices were issued without informing government tenants.Although DOGE initially claimed the cancellations would save nearly $460 million, estimates have since been reduced to $140 million. More than 480 leases previously marked for termination have been spared, covering properties used by the IRS, Social Security Administration and FDA.Job cuts were similarly severe, with headquarters staff reduced by 79% and facilities managers by 35%, according to a federal official. The disruption left 131 leases to expire without agencies vacating properties, exposing taxpayers to heavy fees as landlords were unable to re-let the space.GSA representatives declined to answer questions on staffing or costs, but a spokesman said in an email: “GSA’s leadership team has reviewed workforce actions and is making adjustments in the best interest of the customer agencies we serve and the American taxpayers.”The Government Accountability Office is currently reviewing GSA’s management of workforce reductions, lease cancellations and building sales, with findings expected in the coming months, said senior GAO official David Marroni.","General Services Administration (GSA) issued recall notices that give them until the end of the week to accept or decline.

No ‘luxury goods’ purchase: Trump administration bars Iranian diplomats from shopping; Iran condemns move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-luxury-goods-purchase-trump-administration-bars-iranian-diplomats-from-shopping-iran-condemns-move/articleshow/124081130.cms,"



Iranian diplomats and officials visiting the United States will no longer be allowed to shop at Costco or other wholesale retailers without prior approval from the State Department, according to new restrictions published in the Federal Register this week. The rules, which also apply to accompanying family members, prohibit the purchase of “luxury goods” without US clearance.The announcement came as world leaders gathered in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Wholesale chains like Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club were specifically listed under the new curbs. For years, visiting Iranian officials have been photographed loading up goods -- including televisions and cereal boxes -- during UN trips, images that circulated widely in Iran.“These measures are aimed at exploiting sensitivities in Iranian public opinion,” said Omid Memarian, an Iran expert at DAWN, a Washington-based research group. “For years, many Iranians have been dissatisfied — and even angry — that large delegations travel with presidents to New York, imposing significant costs on the nation in the midst of sanctions and economic austerity.”Iran criticised the move, calling it inappropriate for the host nation of the UNGA.Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said the measures “were unprecedented” and contravened Washington’s obligations as a host.Analysts said the shopping ban was more symbolic than practical. “It is primarily aimed at deepening the wedge between the Iranian state and society,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. He added that the step could also appear “petty” for “the superpower who hosts the UN to try to regulate the shopping of its international guests.”Iranian diplomats have long faced some of the toughest restrictions in the United States. In 2019, the Trump administration confined their movements to a narrow radius around Manhattan’s UN complex, forbidding travel beyond Kennedy Airport, the Iranian mission, or the ambassador’s residence. Former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was even barred from visiting a New York hospital where the Iranian ambassador was receiving treatment.The US has imposed similar curbs on other nations. Russian diplomats require approval to travel outside designated areas, while Chinese diplomats since 2019 must notify the State Department of any meetings held in the US.",Iranian diplomats and officials visiting the United States will no longer be allowed to shop at Costco or other wholesale retailers without prior approval from the State Department.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Trump’s H-1B crackdown: How the ‘American Dream’ got expensive; costlier than luxury cars & homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/trumps-h-1b-crackdown-how-the-american-dream-got-expensive-costlier-than-luxury-cars-homes/articleshow/124039035.cms,"American dream (AI image generated using ChatGPT)

A $5 million dream out of reach



Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee



Relief and panic among Indian professionals



The American dream has long been seen as a promise of opportunity and prosperity, but fresh analysis shows it is becoming alarmingly expensive. According to Investopedia, achieving the traditional dream now carries a lifetime price tag of more than $5 million — a sum larger than the value of most luxury homes or cars. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s new crackdown on H-1B visas has added another barrier for many foreign professionals seeking to build their lives in the United States.The Investopedia report, published this month, calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding. Together, those ambitions total a staggering $5,043,323.Retirement alone is priced at $1.6 million, while home ownership averages nearly $958,000 over a lifetime once mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance are included. Raising two children through university adds $876,092, and new cars — assumed to be bought once a decade — account for another $900,346. Even annual holidays, weddings and pets pile up thousands of dollars more.“This is about showing people the real cost of the dream,” Investopedia editor-in-chief Caleb Silver explained. “Homeownership, raising kids, sending them to college — all of these are rising in price across the board.”As costs soar for Americans, the pathway for foreign workers chasing the same dream is also being reshaped. The Trump administration last week confirmed that all new H-1B visa petitions will carry a one-time fee of $100,000 — a dramatic increase from the current costs of $2,000 to $5,000.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services clarified that the charge applies only to new applications, not to renewals or current visa holders, and will first take effect in the next lottery cycle. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the move, saying it would “discourage companies from spamming the system and driving down wages” while prioritising American workers.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it bluntly: “Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they’re going to depart, and the company is going to hire an American.”The clarification brought some relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals already in the US, who had feared immediate costs to re-enter the country or extend their stay. Still, immigration lawyers warned of chaos for those caught outside America when the proclamation took effect on 21 September, with many scrambling to return before the deadline.Attorney Cyrus Mehta warned that some visa holders could be stranded. “H-1B visa holders who are out of the US on business or vacation will get stuck unless they get in before midnight September 21,” he said.The H-1B programme allows American firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers, with 65,000 visas issued annually under a congressional cap, plus an additional 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees. For decades, it has been the main gateway for Indian and Chinese professionals entering Silicon Valley.","Investopedia calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,” Harris told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow during an interview promoting her new book, 107 Days.Asked directly whether she was endorsing Mamdani, Harris replied, “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” without mentioning the candidate by name. She added that Mamdani was “not the only star” running for mayor, highlighting candidates like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, and Helena Moreno in New Orleans. “I hope that we don’t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country. So that’s where I am — we’ve got a big tent and we’ve got a lot of stars.”Harris’ comments mark her first major television interview since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Her remarks also come amid caution from other top Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs have withheld endorsement of Mamdani, while New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly supported him.Mamdani, a state Assembly member, has received backing from progressive leaders including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Some moderate Democrats, however, have voiced concerns that Mamdani’s democratic socialist positions could be used by Republicans to portray the party as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.

Trump’s push for retribution



A loyalist at the centre







US President Donald Trump has announced that Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer who has long been part of his inner legal circle, will be his nominee for US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment came after the sudden removal of Erik Siebert, the previous prosecutor, who resisted pressure to bring criminal charges against Trump’s political adversaries.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, praising Attorney General Pam Bondi while urging her to act more aggressively. “Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as attorney general of the United States. She is very careful, very smart, loves our country, but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, like my recommendation, Lindsey Halligan, to get things moving,” he wrote.Halligan, a lawyer and former beauty queen, was one of Trump’s legal defenders after the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified documents. More recently, she has worked inside the White House reviewing Smithsonian programmes that the administration claims promote “improper ideology.”Trump has made no secret of his desire to use federal prosecutors against opponents, including New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.“They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW,” Trump posted.Siebert resigned last week after refusing to press charges against James, saying the evidence was insufficient. Trump disputed this, declaring: “I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”Halligan’s selection underscores Trump’s preference for personal loyalty in key legal posts. In his announcement, he called her “Fair, Smart, and \[someone who] will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!”Her elevation surprised many in Washington, especially after another conservative lawyer, Mary “Maggie” Cleary, told colleagues she had been tapped for the role only hours earlier.Whether Halligan serves in an interim capacity or proceeds to a Senate confirmation remains unclear. What is certain is that Trump has chosen a trusted aide with a record of defending him in high-profile legal battles to take on one of the most politically charged prosecutorial roles in the country.","Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer who has long been part of Trump's inner legal circle, will be his nominee for US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.

Starbucks REACTS On Viral ‘Loser’ Kirk Tribute Cup: Company Says CCTV Footage Says SOMETHING ELSE





An Ohio woman was left shocked after ordering Charlie Kirk’s favourite Starbucks drink and finding a derogatory message written on the cup.Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys. When she received her order, an employee had written “racist’s fav drink” on the side of the cup, reported Fox News.“It’s time for people to stop this nonsense,” Perkins was quoted as saying by Fox News Digital.After reporting the incident to the store manager, she learned that the employee admitted to writing the message and was subsequently fired. Perkins said, “I would agree that people should be fired if they're doing something like this. Actions have repercussions. I feel like Charlie stood for respect — we don't have to agree on everything. We can disagree on a lot of things, but we respect each other. We can't communicate and grow if we're disrespecting each other”.Starbucks clarified that writing negative or offensive messages on cups violates company policy.A spokesperson said, “Writing this on a cup is unacceptable, and we have clear policies that prohibit negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.This Starbucks location is licensed and operated by Kroger. We understand that this associate was terminated by Kroger”.Kroger confirmed the firing, adding, “This behavior does not reflect Kroger’s values”.The incident comes amid nationwide attention on Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder who was fatally shot on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. His death has drawn tributes from US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, FBI chief Kash Patel and widespread public mourning.Perkins said she would no longer patronise Starbucks following the incident, adding: “I don't intend to spend another penny at Starbucks — and as far as I'm concerned, neither will my children or anybody else in my family who will listen to me”.The episode also echoes a separate incident in California, where a Starbucks barista initially refused to write Charlie Kirk’s name on a cup, citing company policy against political content.Starbucks later clarified that actual names, including Charlie Kirk, are allowed, distinguishing them from political slogans or offensive phrases.","Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys.

Elon Musk’s Father Under FIRE: Child Abuse Allegations Erupt, Errol DEFENDS Himself With BOLD Claim





Errol Musk, 79, the father of tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been accused of sexually abusing five of his children and stepchildren since 1993, according to a report published by The New York Times on Tuesday.Based on personal letters, emails, and interviews with family members, The New York Times reported that Errol Musk, who has at least nine children and stepchildren and has been married three times, holds considerable influence over most of the family members.Based on court records, personal correspondence, social worker reports, and family interviews, the earliest allegation against Errol Musk dates back to 1993, when his four-year-old stepdaughter reported inappropriate touching. A decade later, she accused him of further misconduct, and additional claims have been made by two daughters and a stepson.The outlet noted that three separate law enforcement investigations were launched; two were closed without action, while the outcome of the third remains unclear, as per NYT.Errol Musk rejected the allegations reported by The New York Times as “false.”“There was no evidence because this is nonsense,” he said, accusing family members of coaching the children to make false claims and attempting to extort his eldest son, Elon.Elon Musk and his personal attorney did not respond to requests for comment.In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Musk said his father had done “almost every evil thing you could possibly think of.”“My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil,” Musk said to the publication.In a 2023 authorized biography by Walter Isaacson, he stated that he no longer communicates with Errol Musk, as per The Guardian.Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital, Errol Musk rose to prominence as a businessman in his 20s and 30s, including serving as a partner in an engineering firm and briefly as a member of the Pretoria City Council.In 1970, he married dietitian and model Maye Haldeman, and the couple had three children, Elon Musk, Tosca Musk, now a streaming service executive for romance films, and Kimbal Musk, who became an entrepreneur.The couple divorced in 1979. In her 2019 memoir, Maye Musk alleged that Errol had physically and verbally abused her, claims he denied to the NYT.","Errol Musk, 79, the father of tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been accused of sexually abusing five of his children and stepchildren since 1993.

The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities,"" Trump said in a speech at the UN.Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump condemned the recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood, calling them a surrender to Hamas’s “ransom demands.”He argued such moves reward the militant group, fuel further conflict, and distract from what he said should be the priority, securing the release of hostages still held in Gaza nearly two years after Hamas attacked Israel.""Instead of giving in to Hamas' ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message - release the hostages now, just release the hostages,"" Trump said.In the past two days, France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Portugal have all formally recognized a Palestinian state.The Palestine Liberation Organization proclaimed an independent Palestinian state in 1988, gaining swift recognition from much of the Global South.Today, nearly 150 of the 193 UN member states acknowledge Palestinian statehood, as reported by Reuters.On Gaza, Trump said he has been “deeply engaged” in efforts to broker a hostage-ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but accused the group of obstructing progress toward ending the war.“Unfortunately, Hamas has repeatedly rejected reasonable offers to make peace,” Trump said. “We can’t forget October 7, can we?”Trump was scheduled to meet on Tuesday with leaders and officials from several Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan, to discuss the escalating crisis in the besieged Gaza Strip.Alongside efforts to secure hostage releases and end the conflict, Trump is also expected to outline US proposals for an Israeli withdrawal and post-war governance in Gaza that excludes Hamas, as cited by Axios.According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the war has left at least 65,382 Palestinians dead. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others during the October 7 attack. Most of those taken hostage have since been freed through ceasefires or negotiated agreements, as per AP.","US President Donald Trump criticized Western nations for recognizing a Palestinian state, arguing the move would reward what he called ""horrible atrocities"" committed by Hamas.

Trump supports Nato on shooting down Russian jets violating their airspace





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday gave strong remarks on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, claiming that Ukraine, with European Union and NATO support, could potentially reclaim all of its territory.Trump, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, slammed Russia’s war effort as “aimless” and described the country as a “paper tiger,” highlighting the severe economic strain on Moscow and major Russian cities caused by the conflict. He noted the difficulty Russians are facing in everyday life, including “the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get gasoline through the long lines that are being formed,” as well as other challenges impacting Russia’s war economy, which is spending most of its resources on fighting Ukraine.“Ukraine, with time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original borders from where this war started is very much an option,” Trump wrote. He emphasized that the country’s people have “great spirit, and only getting better,” and suggested that Ukraine could potentially even go beyond reclaiming its pre-war territory.Trump also addressed the US role in the conflict, stating that the country will continue supplying weapons to NATO “for NATO to do what they want with them.”He concluded by noting, “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.”This marks a pivot from Trump's earlier statements, in which he primarily focused on brokering peace between the two nations in conflict since 2022.In an another development against Russia, Trump said that he agrees with Nato shooting down Russian jets violating their airspaces. When asked by a reporter whether NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, Trump replied, “Yes, I do.”However, he stopped short of committing the United States to taking such action. “Depends on the circumstance,” Trump said, as cited by CNN. “But you know, we’re very strong toward NATO.”Trump also sidestepped questions on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready for peace despite recent escalations.Read more: Donald Trump supports Nato shooting down Russian jets violating airspace; stops short of committing US forces","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday gave strong remarks on the ongoing Ukraine- Russia conflict.

Florida assassination attempt: Ryan Routh found guilty of attempting to kill Donald Trump; US President hails 'meticulously handled' trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-florida-assassination-case-ryan-routh-found-guilty-of-attempting-to-kill-us-president-represented-himself-at-trial/articleshow/124077619.cms,"This courtroom sketch shows U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon listening to Ryan Routh during his trial (AP photo)





A jury on Tuesday found Ryan Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate US President Donald Trump at his Florida golf club last year. After two hours of deliberation, the 12-member jury — five men and seven women — delivered a unanimous verdict on all charges, as reported by Associated Press.Routh, 59, faced multiple federal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, unlawful firearm possession during a violent crime, assault on a federal officer, possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, and possession of a weapon with removed serial numbers. He conducted his own defence throughout the trial, maintaining his innocence.Prosecutors said Routh had meticulously planned the attack for weeks before positioning himself with a rifle in the bushes as Trump played golf on September 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach club.During his closing statement, Routh argued against criminal intent, saying: “It's hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled.” He added that he had a clear view of Trump on the sixth-hole green and highlighted that he did not shoot at a Secret Service agent who approached him.Routh chose not to testify and presented only three witnesses — a firearms specialist and two character references — over three hours.In contrast, the prosecution presented 38 witnesses over seven days.Soon after the verdict, Trump took too social media hailing the verdict and his aides for 'meticulously handling the trial' along with the judiciary. ""Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life. The trial was meticulously handled, and I would like to thank the Judge and Jury for their time, professionalism, and patience,"" he said.""This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service, Department of Florida Law Enforcement, and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime, and acted by following him, and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff’s Office, IMMEDIATELY, which led to his arrest and conviction. What incredible instinct and foresight this person had — A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!"" Trump added.Attorney General Pam Bondi lauded the ruling on X, stating: “This illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence.”Judge Aileen Cannon had approved Routh’s self-representation following July hearings, while his previous lawyers served as standby counsel during the two-week trial.A Secret Service agent testified that he intercepted Routh before Trump appeared. Routh aimed his weapon at the agent, who fired first, causing him to drop the rifle and flee without firing at the former president. A witness later helped authorities identify and locate Routh, who was arrested near the interstate after fleeing the scene.The shooting incident came just nine weeks after another assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump survived a bullet grazing his ear, and the assailant was killed by the Secret Service.Meanwhile, Routh, originally from North Carolina and later living in Hawaii, had a history of involvement in international conflicts and previous legal issues. He had attempted to recruit fighters for Ukraine against Russia and faced earlier arrests in Greensboro, North Carolina, for weapons-related incidents.Alongside the federal charges, Routh faces additional state charges of terrorism and attempted murder, to which he has pleaded not guilty.","Ryan Routh, 59, faced multiple federal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, unlawful firearm possession during a violent crime, assault on a federal officer, and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon.

‘Gotta catch 'em all’: DHS goes viral with Pokémon-themed immigration arrest video-Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gotta-catch-em-all-dhs-goes-viral-with-pokmon-themed-immigration-arrest-video-watch/articleshow/124076799.cms,"Image X@/DHSgov





A Pokémon-themed video released by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), highlighting arrests of immigrants they deemed to be illegal, has gone viral, amassing over 40 million views on X by Tuesday.Posted with the caption “Gotta Catch ’Em All” on Monday, the clip mixes footage of federal law enforcement making arrests on US soil with scenes from the animated series’ opening sequence, set to the show’s theme song.“I will travel across the land, searching far and wide,” the video’s voiceover sings as footage shows men being handcuffed.The video concludes with Pokémon-style cards displaying the mugshots of individuals arrested by immigration agents.One mock trading card, created by DHS, features Lorenzo Menendez-Gonzalez alongside the Cuban flag, noting his conviction for homicide in Austin, Texas, and a 25-year prison sentence.Another card highlights Moises Lopez-Zepeda with the Mexican flag in the background, indicating his conviction for intoxicated manslaughter in Rockwall County, Texas, and a 12-year prison term.Social media users have raised concerns that DHS’s use of Pokémon’s slogan, theme song, and trading card visuals could constitute copyright infringement.Many questioned whether a federal agency can legally repurpose a popular entertainment brand for its messaging.“@/NintendoAmerica please use your suing power for good, just this once,” commented a user.“Please tell me my tax dollars aren’t going to graphic designers to make Pokémon-themed ICE propaganda,” said another.“I can’t believe this was actually posted by a government agency,” read another comment.This comes as the Trump administration is implementing plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated over $140 billion for border walls, enhanced security measures, additional detention beds, and the recruitment of thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents.More than 139,000 individuals have already been deported, with some sent to foreign prisons such as El Salvador’s CECOT, after being classified as gang-affiliated under the Alien Enemies Act, as cited by Fox News.","The video was released by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday.

Pakistan economic setback : Poverty rate reaches 25%; here is what World Bank says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-economic-setback-poverty-rate-reaches-25-here-is-what-world-bank-says/articleshow/124072300.cms,"



The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

India will be wary of outside push to resume Saarc





Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has raised the issue of the revival of Saarc with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of special envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus told Gor, who he met on the margins of the UNGA in New York, that the interim govt has intensified its efforts in this regard, according to Dhaka.Saarc summits are held biennially but has been stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year, and India has since maintained that the neighbour's continued support to cross-border terrorism has made the dialogue unfeasible.Even as Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus wants to revive Saarc, India has continued to support Saarc activities in diverse sectors and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives. While it hasn't withdrawn from the association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through Bimstec in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout of Yunus and Sergio Gor's chat said regional cooperation was discussed but didn't specifically mention Saarc.Bangladesh didn't say what Gor's response was, but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam attack.India sees the appointment of Gor as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka's warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus's efforts to revive Saarc.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit, which Pakistan had to host, was postponed and that there's no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc. However, Dhaka later denied it was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the ""proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka"".",Saarc summits are held biennially but has been stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014.

Nepalese Prime Minister Sushila Karki met with officials from the Election Commission on Tuesday to discuss plans for the country’s upcoming general elections.The 73 year old PM assumed office on September 12, ending a period of political uncertainty after the removal of former Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli. Oli’s ouster came after youth-led protests criticised his government over corruption and a social media ban.Acting on Karki’s recommendation, President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved the House of Representatives and set March 5, 2026, as the date for fresh elections.During the meeting at the Office of the Prime Minister in Singha Durbar, Karki and acting chief election commissioner Ram Prasad Bhandari discussed election management, legal amendments, resource planning, and other preparations, officials said.Law minister Anil Kumar Sinha, also present, told reporters the talks focused on identifying and resolving potential obstacles that could delay election preparations.EC spokesperson Narayan Prasad Bhattarai called the meeting a preliminary dialogue with the government regarding preparations for the general elections. He further added that both sides agreed the elections must be held on time and confirmed the commission’s commitment to a free, fair, and cost-effective process.The Election Commission has asked the government to amend the Voter Registration Act, 2073 BS, and ensure resources are in place for the polls. Currently, about 1,81,68,000 people are eligible to vote, all aged 18 and above.With the fresh election scheduled, legal provisions will be needed to reopen voter registration, an EC official added.","Nepalese Prime Minister Sushila Karki met with officials from the Election Commission on Tuesday to discuss plans for the country’s upcoming general elections.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

A British couple, who were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, have been freed after the Qatari-mediated negotiations.Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March, AP reported.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running “Rebuild,” an organisation providing education and training programmes. Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Charles plays the statesman



The transactional monarchist



Murdoch at the margins



Fortress walls and protest shadows



The bigger picture: Royals as Britain’s bargaining chip

Bottom Line







When Donald Trump strode into Windsor Castle this week in white tie, flanked by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, it wasn’t just another state dinner. It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.

LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate. They watched military parades and Trump inspected the exceptionally large guard of honour.Lt Col Storm Green, captain of the guard of honour, said: “It is the first time we have got all three state colours out — the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards — for a foreign head of state.It’s the biggest one I have done in my 28-year career.”For Starmer, the visit serves as a welcome distraction to the problems he is facing domestically.After lunch, they viewed the Royal Collection where Trump took a particular interest in a document indicating when George III realised America was no longer under his control.They laid a wreath on the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Chapel. After that there was due to be a flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets, followed by a glittering white-tie banquet.The entire day took place within the walls of Windsor Castle. Meanwhile “Stop Trump” demonstrators gathered in London and the Guardian ran an article by London mayor Sadiq Khan slamming Trump.Four men were arrested on Tuesday night after projecting a giant image of Trump and the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle. Police swiftly stopped the projection. The men remain in police custody. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, with whom he was friends earlier in life. On Wednesday, a van could be seen in Windsor displaying a large image on one side of Trump and Epstein with the message: ""Welcome to the UK, Donald. ""A Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TOI: “The driver was at risk of breaching the Road Traffic Regulations Act, and after a brief conversation with officers the motorist left the area. No arrests were made.”",US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory.

Who was Marissa Laimou?







A 28-year-old Greek heiress, Marissa Laimou, a cancer survivor, was found dead in her London flat on September 11. Her family revealed that she was displaying symptoms like dizziness, fever, infections and visited a hospital that turned her away and claimed that she was bitten by an insect.A doctor visited her home and prescribed paracetamol initially, but as her situation did not improve, she was sent to see an oncologist at a hospital. From there she was rushed to another unit but her family claimed that - after being seen by nurses instead of a doctor at the second hospital - she was sent home. Laimou was discharged and handed antibiotics and a diagnosis that referred to an insect bite. But the next day, she was dead.“She was bitten by an insect, she was itchy, she went to the doctor, she took antibiotics, she ate, she slept and she never woke up. My daughter was saved from cancer. My little child,” her mother said, as quoted by the Independent. “She was a girl with so many gifts. All of England is crying, all her doctors too,” she added.The hospital from which Laimou was sent home has reportedly opened an internal investigation over the incident.Meanwhile, a post-mortem is due to be carried out in the coming days.“The entire family is shocked by the sudden death of the daughter of Diamantis and Bessie Laimou. She was a very kind girl, quiet, educated, cultured, modest and simple. She loved art and theatre, she was involved in theatre. Warm condolences to the family! Strength and courage!"" Marissa's great-aunt Chrysanthi said.Daughter of Diamantis and Bessue Laimou, Marissa was part of a wealthy Greek shipping family. She recently survived breast cancer and was working in fashion, business and theatre. She worked in Paris with fashion designers including Sonia Rykiel and John Galliano. Later, she founded Rainbow Wave, a company through which she introduced international brands to UK/London retailers. She was involved in theatre production in London; one recent production was Romeo and Juliet, and she was preparing more theatrical work before her death.","Marissa Laimou, 28, was found dead in her London flat on September 11.

Protesters wave Union Jack and St George's England flags during the ""Unite The Kingdom"" rally on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament on September 13.





Hindus in the UK were placed in the spotlight at a massive rally in London on September 13, where far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known for his harsh criticism of Muslims, described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"".The remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back. Labour-run Leicester City Council has cancelled all public festivities apart from lighting up Diwali lanterns on lampposts and closing Belgrave Road on October 20. A safety advisory group cited public safety concerns after last year’s celebrations attracted a record 55,000 people.The contrast is striking. While Leicester’s Hindu community sees its biggest cultural showcase trimmed down to LED lights and a Ferris wheel, Robinson has positioned himself as a vocal defender of Hindus, especially in the wake of the 2022 Leicester unrest and the grooming gang scandals that have strained community relations.Following the Leicester clashes, Robinson vowed to protect British Hindus, even offering to mobilise “hundreds of men” to support them, as he told a right-wing Indian news outlet.His narrative has since amplified themes of Hindu victimhood, including claims of “a genocide on Hindus” in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, though videos he circulated at the time were later proven fake.In May, a police intelligence report cited by the Daily Mail noted growing links between far-right groups and Hindu extremists in Britain, rooted in a “shared hatred of Muslims”. The report, prepared by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said Robinson had engaged with Hindu organisations to push “anti-Muslim campaigns” and that “his presence seemed to be welcomed by the Indian media and a minority of British Hindus”.The NPCC stressed that moderate Hindus had strongly denounced any alliance between Hindutva supporters and white supremacists.Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, remains a divisive figure in the British right. He founded the English Defence League, notorious for violent street protests in the 2000s and 2010s, and has served multiple prison terms. His most recent conviction came in 2024, when he was sentenced to 18 months for defying a court order in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"" Remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back.

Poll Do you think the judicial system is effective in addressing cases of workplace abuse? Yes, it works well No, it fails many victims





An Indian-origin heart surgeon, Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital in Lancaster. But Bose told the police when they arrested him that ""it was only flirting"".The incidents took place between 2017 and 2022. when he had headed the hospital's cardiovascular surgery department. One woman told the court that Bose's behavior was a well-known fact and newcomers used to be advised on how to deal with him.Bose regularly commented on women's appearances and called them 'fresh meat' on a WhatsApp group.One of Bose's victims told the court she was groped by the surgeon as she scrubbed up ahead of surgery. On another occasion, shortly after she joined the department, Bose rested his head on her shoulder. Another victim was groped in an operating theatre as she helped the consultant prepare for an operation. After putting his gloves on, Bose 'purposefully' grabbed her breast, the court heard.One woman said Bose groped her breast as he helped himself to a pen from her top pocket.One said she was touched inappropriately every time she saw him and that used to leave her frightened and anxious, forcing her to change her working time to avoid him.Defending Bose, Tom Price KC said he realised that Bose had put his victims through the ordeal of a trial but that his client had only fully realised their true hurt in court. The court was informed that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon but lost his job in the wake of the complaints and was now working as a parcel deliveryman.Judge Unsworth acknowledged that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon who had been held in high regard by his colleagues. But he said this simply served to make his offending ""all the more tragic"".","Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital.

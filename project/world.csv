4.5 magnitude earthquake hits Myanmar; no damage reported- third in one month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/4-5-magnitude-earthquake-hits-myanmar-no-damage-reported-third-in-one-month/articleshow/122378219.cms,"4.5 magnitude earthquake jolts Myanmar (Image credits: ANI)





A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

'To focus on policy priorities': US State Department to send layoff notices to staffers soon; will undergo 'biggest reorganization',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-focus-on-policy-priorities-us-state-department-to-send-layoff-notices-to-staffers-soon-set-for-biggest-reorganization/articleshow/122377391.cms,"US Department of State

The 'reorganization' plan





The United States Department of State on Thursday formally informed its staffers that some of them would be receiving their layoff notices soon, as part of dramatic changes announced by the Donald Trump administration earlier this year.""The aim is to focus resources on policy priorities and eliminate redundant functions, empowering our people while increasing accountability,"" deputy secretary Michael Rigas said in a letter to the staffers, The Associated Press reported.“Soon, we will be communicating to individuals affected by the reduction in force. We want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States,” he added, and called it the ""biggest reorganization"" in decades.However, it wasn't immediately clear how many people would be dismissed.These workforce cuts and reorganization are part of a wider administration effort to reduce the size of the federal government. This work has been largely carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), formerly led by Elon Musk. recent ruling by the Supreme Court cleared the way for the layoffs to start, while lawsuits challenging the legality of the cuts continue to play out.In late May, the State Department notified the Congress of an updated reorganization plan, proposing cuts to programmes beyond what had been revealed earlier by secretary of state Marco Rubio, in addition to an 18% reduction of staff in the United States, even higher than the 15% initially floated in April.The Rubio-led department has proposed to eliminate some divisions tasked with oversight of America's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan, including an office focused on resettling Afghan nationals who worked alongside the US military. It also intends to eliminate policies related to refugees and immigration, as well as human rights and democracy promotion.Critics allege that the scale of cuts floated would ""lessen"" America's influence globally and make it hard for many departments to carry out their missions.The American Foreign Service Association, the union which represents diplomats, urged last month to hold off on job cuts.""Notices for a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether, should be a last resort. Disrupting the Foreign Service puts national interests at risk — and Americans everywhere will bear the consequences,” association President Tom Yazdgerdi stated.","The US Department of State on Thursday formally informed its staffers that some of them would be receiving their layoff notices soon.

Flamingos are stirring up trouble and ravaging rice for risotto in Italy's northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/flamingos-are-stirring-up-trouble-and-ravaging-rice-for-risotto-in-italys-northeast/articleshow/122377794.cms,"A flock of Flamingos is seen in a flooded field that produce rice for risotto, in Jolanda Di Savoia, Italy





JOLANDA DI SAVOIAL: An unusual pest is ravaging crops and irking farmers in northeastern Italy: the flamingo.Flocks of these relatively recent immigrants have set their hungry sights on the flooded fields that produce rice for risotto in Ferrara province, between Venice and Ravenna. The long-legged birds aren't interested in the seedlings; rather, flamingos use their webbed feet to stir up the soil and snatch mollusks, algae or insects from the shallow water.Rice is collateral damage.Farmers have started patroling day and night in a bid to scare the birds away. They honk their trucks' horns, bang barrels and even fire small gas cannons that make thunderous booms. Mostly, the noise just sends them flying to another nearby rice paddy to be trampled underfoot.Enrico Fabbri, a local grower, said he is discouraged after seeing production losses of as much as 90% in some of his planted areas.""These are new things that have never happened before. You invest so much time and care into preparing everything,"" Fabbri, 63, said beside one of his paddies on the outskirts of Jolanda di Savoia. ""Then, just as the crop begins to grow, it's like having a newborn child taken away. That's what it feels like.""The flamingos appear to have come from their prior nesting grounds in the nearby Comacchio Valleys within a reserve on the coast, just south of where the Po River, Italy's longest, flows into the Adriatic Sea.The birds have been there since 2000, after drought in southern Spain sent them searching for nesting grounds further east, according to Roberto Tinarelli, ornithologist and president of the Emilia-Romagna Ornithologists Association.Previously, they had been confined to lakes in North Africa, parts of Spain and a bit of France's Camargue region, Tinarelli, 61, said beside a pond in Bentivolgio, a town near Bologna.There have been no studies yet to determine why these flamingos started seeking food further inland, where farmers flood their fields from late spring to early summer as a means of germinating newly planted rice seeds. Until the paddies are drained after a few weeks, the flamingos are a threat.""Obviously, we are looking for answers from those who have to deal with the problem. From an environmental point of view, all this is beautiful, but we must keep in mind that rice cultivation is among the most expensive, extensive crops,"" said Massimo Piva, a 57-year-old rice grower and vice-president of the local farmers' confederation.""They are beautiful animals, it's their way of moving and behaving, but the problem is trying to limit their presence as much as possible,"" Piva said.Tinarelli, the ornithologist, suggested several solutions to fend off flamingos that are more humane and effective than the clamorous efforts currently employed: surrounding paddies with tall trees or hedges and, even better, reducing water levels of freshly planted paddies to between 2 and 4 inches (5 and 10 centimeters), instead of 12 inches (30 centimeters).""This is sufficient for the rice to grow, but decidedly less attractive to flamingos, which must splash around in the water,"" he said.","Flocks of these relatively recent immigrants have set their hungry sights on the flooded fields that produce rice for risotto in Ferrara province, between Venice and Ravenna.

UAE's ICP Denies Golden Visa Rumours

UAE Golden Visa : Rs 23 Lakh Visa Confusion

Has the UAE launched a new golden visa pilot programme? Reports about UAE launching a pilot programme for a new golden visa have created excitement on social media. However, visa consultants and applicants are confused due to lack of official announcements, leading to doubt and frustration.While Indian media outlets had extensively covered the news about UAE's new golden visa pilot, there had been no coverage in UAE media outlets or the Emirates News Agency, which typically publishes all official announcements. The story had gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) has finally dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities, according to a Emirates News Agency report.The Authority emphasised that Golden Visa specifications, requirements and guidelines are explicitly outlined in official regulations and government decrees. Those seeking accurate details can access this information through the Authority's official digital platforms, including their website and mobile application.The authority emphasised that legal measures would be taken against organisations disseminating inaccurate details whilst unlawfully soliciting funds from people who wish to establish residence in the UAE. Such entities take advantage of individuals' aspirations for a respectable and stable lifestyle.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic, and it turns out that it was a rumour.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant had confirmed to ET that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue. The only new update they have is that crypto investors won't be considered for the Golden Visa scheme.”“I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also, they too said they don't have any information on this. I also checked with a couple of officials here who are in the same line of work, they also said they don't have any information in this regard,” he added.A senior official, speaking anonymously to the financial daily, had emphasised that UAE visas are not available for purchase. The government may grant Golden Visas based on various criteria, including AED 2 million real estate investments, business ownership, and notable achievements in science, medicine, arts, culture, media, and sports.The Vision Dubai 2033 strategy aims to double the UAE economy, acknowledging population growth as essential for achieving this objective.Also read | UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit","UAE's ICP has dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities.

What is Blue alert?







Blue alert has been issued in Texas as authorities continue their search for a 12th suspect in what officials describe as a July 4 “ambush” at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Fox4 reported.Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.The suspect, a former US Marine Corps Reservist of five years, allegedly used two AR-15-style rifles to fire at three officers during the ambush.Moreover, the FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song's arrest.A Blue alert is a public safety notification system used to help locate and apprehend suspects who have seriously injured or killed a law enforcement officer. Much like Amber or Silver alerts, it leverages broadcast and digital platforms to quickly inform the public and encourage tips that may lead to an arrest.To issue a Blue alert, specific conditions must be met: a law enforcement officer must have been killed or critically injured; the suspect must pose a serious threat to the public or other officers; and there must be identifying information such as a vehicle description or license plate that can be shared widely.Additionally, the investigating agency must recommend activation to the Texas department of public safety.Currently, Texas is one of 34 US states that operate a Blue alert system, using it as a tool to engage the public in high-priority manhunts where officer safety and community risk are at stake.","Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.

Trump seems to be warming to new sanctions on Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-seems-to-be-warming-to-new-sanctions-on-russia/articleshow/122377570.cms,"File photo





BERLIN: Since President Donald Trump retook the Oval Office, leaders across Europe have prodded him to forcefully back Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. In recent weeks, some of them tried a new approach in private conversations with a president who they know often responds well to flattery.In exchanges with Trump, those leaders, including Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, praised the president for sending US bombers to deliver a major blow to Iran's nuclear programme, according to two European officials familiar with the matter. They told Trump he could do something similar in Ukraine - not with bombs, but with a fresh batch of penalties aimed at crippling Russia's economy.The president finally appears to be warming to the idea.Merz and his counterparts in France, Britain and Italy have publicly told Trump that new US sanctions could force President Putin of Russia to enter serious negotiations about ending the war. Without them, Putin has been escalating and prolonging Russia's attacks in an attempt to break Ukraine's defences. Those escalations appear to have frayed Trump's patience with Putin.On Tuesday, fresh from what he portrayed as a frustrating phone conversation with Putin, Trump said he was ""very strongly"" considering supporting a bipartisan Senate bill that would impose severe sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.Those countries include China, India, Brazil and even some members of the EU.Oil production is a driver of Russia's economy and a crucial source of revenue for Putin's war machine. Western leaders have been trying to choke off those revenues since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, including with sanctions. They have not succeeded as well as they had hoped. A new effort to target the sector is included in the bill, which was offered by Senators Lindsey Graham (Republican) and Richard Blumenthal (Democrat). It has 83 supporters in the Senate.The top Senate Republican said Wednesday that a vote on the bill could come as soon as this month. Momentum has been building on Capitol Hill behind the measure. The majority leader, Senator John Thune (Republican), said Wednesday that ""substantial progress"" had been made on ""overwhelmingly bipartisan Russia sanctions legislation to enhance Trump's leverage at the negotiating table and help end the war in Ukraine. "" He said the measure could come to a Senate vote ""as early as this work period,"" referring to the period between now and Aug 1, when the chamber departs for a monthlong recess.Some analysts have suggested that the legislation, if approved, could pack a much larger punch than any previous sanctions imposed on Russia. But other analysts warn that it would take time for the bill's penalties to hit Russia hard enough to force Putin to negotiate, and that Trump might not follow through with many of them.Russian officials do not appear to be concerned about the prospect of Trump backing a new round of sanctions.","Leaders across Europe have prodded him to forcefully back Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.

‘Do not travel to Iran’: US issues fresh advisory citing dual nationality recognition; launches warning website,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-not-travel-to-iran-us-issues-fresh-advisory-citing-dual-nationality-recognition-launches-warning-website/articleshow/122375727.cms,"State departnment briefing





The US State Department has launched a fresh initiative to alert Americans, with emphasis on Iranian Americans, claim grave dangers in visiting Iran. This announcement was made by State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who strongly advised against travel to Iran, particularly for those with Iranian heritage.During a press conference on Thursday (local time), Bruce said that Iran does not acknowledge dual citizenship and restricts consular access to US citizens in detention. She introduced a new website specifically designed to warn Americans about Iranian travel risks.Bruce said, ""The department is announcing a new awareness campaign warning Americans, especially Iranian Americans, about the continuing severe risks of travel to Iran. The Iranian regime does not recognize dual nationality and routinely denies consular services to detained US citizens. And while the bombing has stopped, that does not mean that it is safe to travel to Iran, it is not. We are also launching a new website dedicated to warning Americans against travel to Iran. And there you have it (Pointing to the website displayed on the screen). You can get that website starting at state.gov...Ithink if you go to state.gov, you do a search, you will find that quite easily.""She further added, ""The message is clear as you can tell in multiple languages. Our travel advisories are there as well. They remain in place and we cannot stress enough as we continue to do as I have multiple times from this podium. Do not travel to Iran especially those of you who are the dual citizens who have Iranian heritage. It is not safe for anyone to travel to Iran. And again, this supplements also the existing travel advisories. It does not supplant them at travel.state.gov. Our message is clear, I think so.""This advisory follows recent tensions involving conflicts between Israel and Iran, including US strikes on Iranian facilities.President Donald Trump recently expressed hope for avoiding further military engagement with Iran, indicating that Tehran seeks dialogue. He spoke at a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday (local time).Trump had said, ""I hope we're not going to have to do that. I can't imagine wanting to do that. I can't imagine them wanting to do that. They (Iran) want to meet ... They want to work something out. They are very different now than they were two weeks ago.""Regarding potential discussions with Iran, Trump confirmed scheduled talks, stating, ""We're going to have a meeting...We'll see what happens. We have scheduled Iran talks. They want to talk. They took a big drubbing, I think, when we hit the three sites.""Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed readiness for dialogue with the US whilst noting trust-building challenges due to previous US and Israeli actions, according to Al Jazeera.The situation escalated on June 13 when Israel initiated ""Operation Rising Lion"", conducting extensive strikes on Iranian facilities, including Natanz and Fordow nuclear sites, missile facilities, and IRGC bases.The operation resulted in casualties among IRGC leadership and nuclear scientists. The US followed with ""Operation Midnight Hammer"" on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear infrastructure.Iran responded with missile strikes against Israel and an attack on a US airbase in Qatar. Tehran condemned these operations as violations of international law and the UN Charter.","The US State Department has launched a fresh initiative to alert Americans, with emphasis on Iranian Americans, of grave dangers in visiting Iran.

Amid the deadly flooding in central Texas, animal rescue groups are working tirelessly to shelter displaced pets, relocate them, and ensure their safety until they can be reunited with their families.Marc Peralta, chief program officer at Best Friends Animal Society, quoted ABC News, said, “When the floods occurred, we knew right away from other emergency response situations, such as the fires in Los Angeles, that we have shelters that are full of animals and what we are going to need in any event like this was to make room for displaced pets, lost pets and provide that relief for families that are already going through complete tumultuous situations to maybe have one less thing to worry about. ”In response to the crisis, Best Friends Animal Society and its partners airlifted around 130 cats and dogs, allowing them to take shelter in the community, stay safe, and, hopefully, reunite with their families.Peralta explained that the organization is equipped to accommodate pets for extended stays during emergencies. However, if reunification is not possible, the pets can eventually be put up for adoption.“Just like any pet in a shelter, they can go up for adoption. But a lot of times if situations like this occur, we will extend wait periods just to make sure that we are giving ample amount of time because we always want them to go back home first, especially if we know they are stranded or lost,” he said.Many of the local partner organizations are working directly in the flood-affected areas. They rely heavily on donations and have created online wish lists for those who wish to support the shelters by purchasing needed supplies.“Just like for people, we're just kind of scratching the surface in understanding what the actual devastation is for animals in the area as well,” said Peralta.The scale of the disaster continues to grow. According to the Associated Press, at least 120 people have died in the flash floods, and more than 170 remain missing. The search for victims continues, though efforts are hampered by vast stretches of rubble and overflowing rivers.","Animal rescue groups are working tirelessly to shelter displaced pets, relocate them, and ensure their safety until they can be reunited with their families.

Internet erupted in disbelief after 40-year-old MAGA commentator Nick Adams posted a video thanking President Donald Trump for the 'honor of a lifetime'. Social media users looked for official confirmation before dismissing it as a prank and found out that indeed Trump nominated the MAGA troll as the US ambassador to Malaysia. Adams has no prior experience in diplomacy though he has experience in politics but in Australia where he was born. In 2005, he became Australia's youngest ever deputy mayor when he was elected to help run suburban Ashfield.Out of his many peculiar policies, Adams wanted to ban pigeons and wanted to use DNA testing to track down dog owners who failed to clean up after their pets.“Mr. President, thank you for the honor of a lifetime. In your America, all dreams come true. It will be my honor to represent the United States of America in Malaysia,” Adams said in a clip posted to X on Thursday. “To the esteemed Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to a confirmation process that is at the heart of the Constitution that has given me the freedom to pursue the American Dream.”Adams is known for incendiary comments like he calls himself an ""alpha male"", called Taylor Swift ""woke Jezebel"" etc.“I go to Hooters. I eat rare steaks. I lift extremely heavy weights. I read the Bible every night. I am pursued by copious amounts of women. I am wildly successful. I have the physique of a Greek God. I have an IQ over 180. I am extremely charismatic. They hate this,"" Adams once said.""Imagine the Malaysian government finding out their ambassador from the US is Nick Adams,"" one user wrote while another commented that US was basically deporting him to Malaysia.Many people commented that they used to think that Nick Adams was not a real person and a parody account on X.South China Morning Post reported that Nick Adams could be a very wrong fit for Muslim-majority Malaysia which favors quiet diplomacy over headline-grabbing rhetoric. “It’s a surprising pick that favours political loyalists over those who actually fit the post,” the newspaper quotes an unnamed diplomat based in the Malaysian capital as saying.","Trump nominates Nick Adams as Malaysia ambassador.

‘Canary Mission’: Trump administration used shady website to get names of pro-Palestinian activists; could potentially lead to visa revocation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canary-mission-trump-administration-used-shady-website-to-get-names-of-pro-palestinian-activists-could-potentially-lead-to-visa-revocation/articleshow/122372090.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





Newly unsealed court documents and trial testimony have revealed that the Trump administration has heavily relied on an anonymously run pro-Israel website, accused of doxxing, to identify pro-Palestinian academics for potential deportation.The court records revealed that in order to support US President Donald Trump’s deportation drive, the Department of Homeland Security assembled a “tiger team” of intelligence who compiled data on roughly 100 foreign students and scholars involved in pro-Palestinian activism.The website, known as Canary Mission, flagged over 75 individuals.Canary Mission has stated that they did not have “contact with this administration or the previous administration,” as reported by Politico. They said that they have a mission to investigate hatred promoted against the US, Israel and Jews.“We document individuals and groups that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews. We investigate hatred across the political spectrum, including the far-right, far-left and anti-Israel activists,” the group said.Previously, immigration lawyers as well as pro-Palestinian activists were skeptical that the Trump administration was utilizing the website to sort the names of the academics and potentially seeking to revoke their visas, with little to no independent research.But the depositions reveal how broadly the Trump administration relied on the website.Homeland security official Peter Hatch admitted that the site has been important to the Trump administration’s efforts but also stated the information taken from the website was independently verified.“Many of the names or even most of the names came from that website, but we were getting names and leads from many different websites,” Hatch said. “We received information on the same protesters from multiple sources, but Canary Mission was the most inclusive. The lists came in from all different directions.”“Canary Mission is not a part of the US government,” he said. “It is not information that we would take as an authoritative source. We don’t work with the individuals who create the website. I don’t know who creates the website,” said Hatch, as reported by Politico.Court records revealed that Trump aide Stephen Miller was heavily involved in efforts aiming to revoke the visas of pro-Palestinian academics who are studying and teaching at American colleges.","Newly unsealed court documents and trial testimony have revealed that the Trump administration has heavily relied on an anonymously run pro-Israel website. The website, known as Canary Mission, flagged over 75 individuals. The Department of Homeland Security assembled a “tiger team’ of intelligence who compiled data on roughly 100 foreign students and scholars involved in pro-Palestinian activism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122372203,imgsize-674694,width-400,resizemode-4/122372203.jpg"

A California woman has been receiving hundreds of huge Amazon packages that she never ordered after a Chinese seller called Liusandedian used her address as the return destination.Identified only as Kay, the woman has been receiving these packages for over a year. The volume has been so overwhelming that she has had to stack up these boxes in her driveway just to keep things somewhat organized. She is struggling to park her car in her property due to the sheer number of packages piled up there.Months turned to a year, but Kay did not stop receiving these packages. ""I couldn't even get my mother in the house...it's just been another form of he**,” she said, referring to her 88-year-old mother, who is disabled, as reported by ABC 7.""And every time I was absolutely assured this will stop... you won't get any more of these packages, you'll hear from us in 24, 48 hours..."" Kay said.Liusandedian appears to sell seat covers that are tailored to fit various models of Sedans and SUVs. In many cases, the covers didn’t fit, and customers said they had to pay out of pocket to send them back to the company’s so-called “return center.”Kay said Amazon has left her to deal with the problem on her own, advising her to give away the packages, donate them, or return them via USPS or FedEx. Amazon, however, disputed that claim, stating it never suggested she took the boxes to USPS or FedEx.""Why is it my responsibility to get rid of this, when your seller is not following your rules, Amazon?"" she told ABC7Amazon policy says international sellers must either give a US return address, offer a returnless refund, or provide a prepaid international return label within two days. If they don’t respond, Amazon can refund the buyer and charge the seller.Liusandedian has appeared to circumvent the policy by providing an address that was Kay’s to avoid losing all proceeds from the sale or covering the cost of shipping the item back to China.\Amazon also requires third-party sellers must list a physical address on their profile, but it doesn't have to be in the US.Instead, this has led to customers being stuck with a bill.""This is thousands of dollars they've paid to send these boxes back to my house!"" Kay said as those boxes were finally removed.","A California woman has been receiving hundreds of huge Amazon packages that she never ordered after a Chinese seller used her address as the return destination.

"Setback for Trump: New Hampshire judge pauses birthright citizenship order; calls it 'lawless, cruel'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-new-hampshire-judge-pauses-birthright-citizenship-order-calls-it-lawless-cruel/articleshow/122370461.cms,"Birthright Citizenship: Trump Elated As SC Decides To Hear His Case | 'Rooted In Slavery'





A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship in the United States, calling the move “lawless, unconstitutional and cruel. ”Judge Joseph LaPlante announced on Thursday that he would certify a class action lawsuit covering all children who would be affected by the order, and issue a preliminary injunction to halt its enforcement.The written ruling, he said, will follow shortly and include a seven-day stay to allow the federal government to appeal.The class certified by the court is slightly narrower than what the plaintiffs initially proposed, excluding parents from the group. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, represented a pregnant woman, two parents, and their newborns.The case is one of several challenging Trump’s January order, which denies automatic US citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants or those in the country on temporary visas, AP reported.At the center of the legal fight is the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants citizenship to “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”The Trump administration argues that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” excludes children of people living in the US illegally, a position that, if upheld, would overturn over a century of settled legal interpretation.In court filings, government lawyers claimed that previous interpretations of the citizenship clause had created a “perverse incentive” for illegal immigration, harming the country’s sovereignty and security.Judge LaPlante, who previously issued a narrower injunction in a related case, said the government’s arguments were not frivolous but ultimately unconvincing. “This was not a close call,” he said, adding that stripping children of their citizenship posed “clear and irreparable harm.”Plaintiffs’ lawyer Cody Wofsy said the ruling would bring relief to countless families who had been left confused and frightened by the executive order. This “is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional and cruel executive order,” he said.Several federal judges had earlier issued nationwide injunctions to halt Trump’s order from taking effect. However, a US Supreme Court ruling on 27 June curtailed those injunctions, giving lower courts a 30-day window to respond. In light of that deadline, opponents swiftly returned to court in an effort to block the order once again.In Washington state, the 9th circuit court of appeals has asked both sides to explain how the Supreme Court’s decision affects ongoing challenges.CASA’s legal director Ama Frimpong urged everyone to remain calm and said that it is not time to panic.“No one has to move states right this instant,” she said, adding, “there's different avenues through which we are all fighting, again, to make sure that this executive order never actually sees the light of day.”The New Hampshire plaintiffs, who were anonymised in court documents, include a Honduran woman with a pending asylum claim, expecting her fourth child in October. She said she fled with her family to escape gangs targeting them.“I do not want my child to live in fear and hiding,” she wrote. “I fear our family could be at risk of separation.”Another plaintiff, a Brazilian man living in Florida, said his US-born baby deserved the right to citizenship. He and his wife are seeking permanent legal status through her father, a US citizen.“My baby has the right to citizenship and a future in the United States,” he said.","A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship in the United States.

Who is Dr Anjani Sinha?





Dr Anjani Sinha, an Indian-born Florida surgeon and businessman, whom President Donald Trump picked for the post of US ambassador to Singapore, was grilled at the Senate confirmation as he appeared to know nothing about Singapore. He was told to shape up and do some homework as the post is not just a glamor job where he gets to stay in Singapore. The video of Dr Sinha's grilling by Illinois Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth went viral.Facing the heat, Dr Sinha admitted that he was not an expert in global affairs or trade but an orthopedic and sports surgeon who has been a lifelong bridge builder.Duckworth asked Dr Sinha if he knew the size of the United States trade surplus with Singapore. Dr Sinha said $80 billion first and then revised it to $18 billion. Duckworth informed him it was actually $2.8 billion.“When is Singapore going to be the ASEAN chair?” Dr Sinha was then asked. Dr Sinha said he did not know and was informed that the correct answer will be 2027.“What does holding the chairmanship entail for Singapore? Can you name one thing?” Duckworth said making it clear that she was trying to help him.“I just feel you are not taking this seriously,” she rebuked Dr Sinha. “You think this is a glamour posting—that you’re going to live a nice life in Singapore—when what we need is someone who can actually do the work.““You are not currently prepared for this posting, period, and you need to shape up and do some homework,"" she said.Dr Sinha's nomination was first announced by Donald Trump in March, when the US President praised him as a ""highly respected entrepreneur"". ""I have no doubt that Anji will strongly represent our Nation's Interests, and put America First. Congratulations Anji!"" said Trump in a Truth Social post.Dr Sinha was born in India and also studied in India's Delhi University. He is referred to as 'Anji' in a State Department document that details his credentials. ""Dr Anji Sinha is a preeminent surgeon on the East Coast specializing in orthopedics and sports medicine. He is an accomplished entrepreneur, having built multiple thriving key-man practices with specialized teams across eight locations in New York, and has served as a senior surgical consultant in Florida,"" it said adding that his wife Dr Kiki Sinha is a benefactor of various institutions of higher education in US and also in India.Will Dr Sinha's nomination now be canceled?According to experts, the prospect of Dr Sinha who is known to be a friend of the President because of the their Florida connection has the chance of becoming the Singapore envoy as Republican leader Lindsey Graham controls the committee's decision and the GOP has a Senate majority.","Dr Anjani Sinha, an Indian-born Florida surgeon and businessman, was grilled at the Senate confirmation as he appeared to know nothing about Singapore.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt. His sister, Aleema Khan, claims he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are being held without access to sunlight, visitors, or even newspapers.",Imran Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accuses govt of 'personal vendetta' She claims sons Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have not been allowed to speak to their father.

The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

Beijing 'Open To Arming' Allies





ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

"Indus in turmoil: Swat Valley, Gilgit-Baltistan swamped by floods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/indus-in-turmoil-swat-valley-gilgit-baltistan-swamped-by-floods/articleshow/122305695.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world. Scientists warn that climate change is driving a rise in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, putting millions at risk.Rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities have called on the public to remain cautious as the monsoon season continues to intensify.",At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days.

'Free Balochistan': Who is Tommy Robinson?

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"
Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs.

Rights groups in Bangladesh have accused the interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, of ignoring a disturbing surge in violence against religious minorities and shielding perpetrators from justice. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said on Thursday that it had recorded 2,442 incidents of communal violence between August 2024 and June 2025—many of them involving killings, sexual assaults, arson, and the destruction of places of worship and property.The group alleges that these attacks intensified following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year and have continued under the current administration. “The accused are enjoying impunity,” said Monindra Kumar Nath, the council’s acting general secretary, adding that the authorities have repeatedly dismissed their concerns as fabricated or politically motivated, despite compelling evidence. Yunus’ office has acknowledged only 88 cases of violence and claims 70 people have been arrested.Council leaders say religious minorities, who make up around 10% of Bangladesh’s population of 170 million, have been systematically excluded from national reform processes.“No representative from minority groups has been included in any commission meant to ensure equality,” Nath said. Others pointed to a long history of marginalisation since the country’s independence in 1971. “We hoped for better under a Nobel Peace Prize winner, but we have only seen continued neglect,” said Kajal Debnath, a council member.On May 22, following a murder unrelated to the minority community, attackers targeted the homes of 20 minority families, looting, burning property, and allegedly assaulting women. Despite a police case being filed, no arrests have been made in the five weeks since, according to the council. Many victims have fled or gone into hiding, and vital documents such as house deeds and ID cards were destroyed.India has taken note of the situation. The ministry of external affairs reportedly told a parliamentary panel that the Yunus government is downplaying the scale of violence, which it blames on political motives rather than communal targeting. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri warned that extremist groups are filling the power vacuum left by Hasina’s exit, leading to increased religious radicalisation. The Indian government has called for action against those responsible for anti-minority violence and for Bangladesh to uphold its commitments to religious freedom.","Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council recorded 2,442 incidents of communal violence between August 2024 and June 2025.

Malaysian beauty queen and actor Lishalliny Kanaran, winner of Miss Grand Malaysia 2021, has accused an Indian priest of molesting her during a recent visit to a Hindu temple. The allegation surfaced after Kanaran shared a detailed account of the incident on Instagram two days ago, sparking public outrage and calls for immediate action.Lishalliny said she visited the Mariamman Temple in Sepang alone on June 21, as her mother was in India. Being unfamiliar with temple rituals, she usually relied on the priest for guidance.During the visit, the priest told her he had some holy water and a protective string for her. After she completed her prayers, she waited for about 90 minutes before the priest asked her to follow him to his private office for the blessing.Inside the office, the priest poured a strong-smelling liquid, described by Lishalliny as rose or flower essence, into the holy water and told her it was brought from India and not given to ordinary people. He then began splashing the water on her, so much that she couldn’t open her eyes.The situation escalated when the priest allegedly asked Kanaran to lift her Punjabi suit. When she declined, explaining that it was too tight, he reportedly scolded her for wearing such attire.He then stood behind her, held her head, and began murmuring what she believed were prayers—before allegedly putting his hands inside her blouse and bra.“My brain knew everything about that moment was wrong and yet I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. I froze. And I still don’t understand why,” she said.Kanaran said she spent the following days feeling disgusted and deeply traumatised. After her mother returned from India, she confided in her.

Someone had already reported him before for the same thing and yet no action had been taken,” Kanaran said, accusing the temple management of prioritising its reputation over helping victims.The actress’s detailed social media post has sparked outrage, with calls for the suspect to be swiftly apprehended. Police have not yet located the priest but confirmed that efforts to track him down are underway.Sepang district police chief ACP Norhizam Bahaman, speaking to Malay Mail, said, “The suspect is an Indian national who was temporarily filling the position because the temple’s resident priest is currently abroad.”“The suspect’s modus operandi was allegedly to sprinkle holy water on the victim’s face and body before proceeding to molest her,” he added.","Lishalliny Kanaran, winner of Miss Grand Malaysia 2021, has accused an Indian priest of molesting her during a recent visit to a Hindu temple.

Malaysian PM warns Southeast Asia that trade war is not a 'passing storm',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/malaysian-pm-warns-southeast-asia-that-trade-war-is-not-a-passing-storm/articleshow/122355159.cms,"Malaysian prime minister





KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim warned Wednesday that global trade is being weaponised as Southeast Asia's foreign ministers held annual talks ahead of the looming threat of US trade tariffs.Concerns about US tariffs have jolted the association of Southeast Asian nations, a 10-member bloc that includes some of the world's most trade-dependent economies.Eight Asean members are among countries that could see duties on their exports to the US skyrocket on August 1.Launching the group's foreign ministers' meeting, Anwar said the world is now witnessing an era where ""power unsettles principle"" and ""tools once used to generate growth are now wielded to pressure, isolate and contain.""Without mentioning the US by name, he again urged Asean to work together to respond to trade threats.""Our cohesion must not end at declarations,"" he said, calling for members to increase intra-Asean trade, invest in regional integration, and reduce strategic dependencies on external powers. ""This is no passing storm,"" he said. ""It is the new weather of our time.""Trump first announced tariffs in April, but then delayed them for 90 days to allow for deals to be negotiated.On Monday and Wednesday, he announced new tariffs with rates of between 20 per cent- 40 per cent on a list of countries, which will go into effect August 1 unless new deals are struck. He also threatened to increase tariffs if any countries retaliate.Many Asean members have launched bilateral talks with the US, but officials have said they plan to hold an Asean - US summit later this year to seek a common position.So far, only Vietnam has secured a deal, bringing down its tariffs from 46 per cent to 20 per cent.The lists threaten 36 per cent tariffs for Thailand and Cambodia, 32 per cent for Indonesia, 25 per cent for Malaysia and Brunei, 20 per cent for the Philippines, and 40 per cent for Laos and war-torn Myanmar.Reacting to the economic headwinds, Malaysia's central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in five years.Separately, trade minister Zafrul Aziz said Malaysia will continue tariff talks with the US but won't compromise on issues impacting national interest and sovereignty. He referred to US requests on policy and laws in areas such as government procurement, halal certification, medical standards and digital tax, without giving details.""It has to be fair ... if the deal does not benefit Malaysia, we should not have a deal,"" he said.In addition to confronting trade fallout, the bloc faces mounting internal challenges including the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia.The gathering in Malaysia will be immediately followed by a series of critical meetings with Asean's major trade partners, including the US, China, Japan, Russia, India, and the European Union, scheduled for Thursday and Friday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who last week cancelled trips to Japan and South Korea, arrived Thursday for the talks as part of his first visit to Asia since taking office. Others visiting foreign ministers include China's Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov of Russia.Analysts said these talks will test Asean's ability to assert its voice amid escalating geopolitical tensions.The bloc hopes to reinforce its commitment to a rules-based trade order while resisting pressure to align exclusively with any one global power.""Asean must be among those who choose to stand for rules, even when others choose retreat,"" Anwar said. Officials said the premier will meet Rubio to discuss the tariff issue.Analysts said Rubio's presence signaled renewed US engagement in the region.It will be a reminder to ""the region that Washington remains its most vital economic and security partner,"" said Collins Chong Yew Keat, a foreign affairs, strategy and security analyst with Universiti Malaya. But he said that US support may now come with clearer expectations.""Trump's administration, while still offering the strongest military deterrence and market access, expects Asean to stop exploiting this security umbrella while cozying up economically to China,"" he said.","Southeast Asia's foreign ministers held annual talks ahead of the looming threat of US trade tariffs.

Hasina faces tribunal, sentenced in contempt case





The interim government of Bangladesh, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus , on Wednesday called on India to act with ""conscience and moral clarity"" over its handling of a formal request to extradite former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who is facing charges of crimes against humanity.The statement follows a December 2024 note verbal, a formal diplomatic communication, sent by Dhaka to New Delhi, requesting Hasina’s extradition. While India acknowledged receiving the note, it has not commented further, prompting sharp criticism from Dhaka.“For too long, India has refused to comply with Bangladesh’s lawful request for the extradition of Sheikh Hasina,” said Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, in a post on social media. He added that India’s position was “no longer tenable” and warned that “regional friendship, strategic considerations, or political legacy” could not justify “the deliberate murder of civilians.”The statement came a day after BBC Bangla published a report featuring a leaked phone call that allegedly captured Hasina ordering security forces to shoot student protesters during last year’s nationwide uprising.Alam cited the BBC Eye Investigations unit’s findings, claiming they confirmed Hasina's direct role in “state-sanctioned murder.” He urged the international community to take note, especially as a “global institution like the BBC” had dedicated significant resources to investigating alleged abuses in Bangladesh.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 in Bangladesh is set to decide on July 10 whether charges will be formally framed against Hasina and two of her top aides. This follows a ruling last week in which the 77-year-old Awami League leader was sentenced to six months in prison in absentia in a contempt of court case.The tribunal proceedings mark the first sentencing against Hasina since she left office in August last year, after her nearly 16-year rule ended with a mass uprising and her subsequent flight to India.According to a UN human rights report, as many as 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and August 15, 2024, during a brutal security crackdown on demonstrators under Hasina’s government. Most of the Awami League leadership and key officials have either been arrested or are in hiding as the interim administration continues its sweeping crackdown.India has so far not issued a public response to the latest appeal.","Bangladesh calls on India to act with ""conscience and moral clarity"" Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina is facing charges of crimes against humanity.

"'Nightmare to work with Indians': Citi in London fires woman for racial comment, she now sues bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nightmare-to-work-with-indians-citi-in-london-fires-woman-for-racial-comment-she-now-sues-bank/articleshow/122369922.cms,"Citi Bank London fired a senior employee after she said it was a nightmare to work with Indians.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank.

"Royal ‘plan’: Prince William was wary of Meghan Markle’s entry into family, biographer makes startling revelation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-plan-prince-william-was-wary-of-meghan-markles-entry-into-family-biographer-makes-startling-revelation/articleshow/122369559.cms,"Prince William (AP) and Meghan Markle (ANI)





Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.The Prince of Wales, 43, apparently had early doubts about Meghan’s intentions of joining the royal family, Damper told The Sun.His skepticism is said to have surfaced around the same time Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, revealed that the late monarch herself had reservations about Markle’s entry into the royal fold, remarked Dampier.“I think, unfortunately, that confirms what I’ve been saying or thought for the last few years that, sadly, Meghan never really had any intention of staying in the royal family,” he said while referencing to Anson’s comments. “She saw as a stepping stone getting married to Harry to new fame and fortune. And I think that’s what initially Prince William was concerned about,” he added.“That’s why they fell out. And now we are where we are. But to have this confirmed by somebody so close to the Queen is really dynamite,” said Dampier.Lady Elizabeth Anson, who passed in 2020, at the age of 79, told The Times of London, “When I spoke with the queen, she said she is not at all content.Meghan could turn into nothing but trouble. She sees things in a different way.""Dampier said that the revelation was “very, very telling,” noting that it came “right from the horse’s mouth.” He emphasized that the comments made by Anson were credible.Royal broadcaster Esther Krauke weighed in on the revelation and said that the Late Queen’s outlook towards Meghan might have been positive initially, but had changed over time. “The Queen’s opinion of Meghan evolved, and it’s much like how the country’s opinion evolved,” she said to The Sun.“And much like the public, I think the Queen thought Meghan was a breath of fresh air. Very intelligent, very well-spoken, obviously from her acting background,” she said. “And she worked, she welcomed her,” Krakue said. “I think, like much of the country with open arms, I think where things went wrong was clearly the cultural clash.”Krauke also mentioned King Charles is fully aware of how Prince Harry is “totally whipped” by his wife. “We know that King Charles said something about him being whipped,” she commented. “We keep hearing things consistently coming out from courtiers and people that are close to the royal family.”During a state banquet on Tuesday, at Windsor Castle, King Charles. 76 had delivered a speech that had warmly referred to Prince William and Catherine’s family, but made no mention of Prince Harry and Meghan, who exited royal life back in 2020, as reported by The New York Post. French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were also present at the dinner.","Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.

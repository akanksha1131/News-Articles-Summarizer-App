‘Use paper ballots only’: Donald Trump vows executive order on voter ID; seeks mail-in voting only for ill and military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/use-paper-ballots-only-donald-trump-vows-executive-order-on-voter-id-seeks-mail-in-voting-only-for-ill-and-military/articleshow/123610120.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter identification mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.“Voter ID must be part of every single vote. No exceptions! I will be doing an executive order to that end!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added, “Also, No Mail-In Voting, except for those that are very ill, and the far away military. Use paper ballots only!!!”.The post builds on Trump’s repeated pledges to overhaul US voting systems. A few days ago, he said the order was being prepared “by the best lawyers in the country” to eliminate mail-in ballots, reported The New York Times.Trump argued that Republicans needed to “get tough and stop it” because, in his view, Democrats benefited disproportionately from the practice.Mail-in and absentee voting accounted for just over 30 per cent of ballots in the 2024 elections, according to news agency AFP. Although Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed the system is open to fraud, experts and officials have stressed there is no evidence postal voting is less secure than in-person voting.Pro-democracy groups have also warned that scrapping it could disenfranchise millions of Americans, particularly those with disabilities or other barriers to reaching polling places.Constitutionally, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally change election rules. The power to regulate the “times, places and manner” of elections lies with state legislatures, and only Congress can override those laws. As The New York Times noted, any executive order targeting mail-in ballots or voting procedures would face immediate legal challenges.Trump has previously relied on absentee voting himself, including during Florida’s 2020 primaries. His critics argue the push to end mail-in voting is politically motivated, pointing out that Democrats have historically outnumbered Republicans in using postal ballots.","US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter ID mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.

Minnesota church shooting: Did Trump administration cuts weaken security?

Weeks before a gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, the Trump administration cut funding for a Minnesota program intended to prevent acts of mass violence, according to documents cited by the New York Times.In July, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3).About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.DPS Commissioner Bob Jacobson wrote to the state’s congressional delegation at the time that “without this funding, our capacity to protect our communities from targeted violence and terrorism will be significantly diminished.”DPS spokesperson Jill Oliveira was quoted as saying by the New York Times that since the cuts, the agency had cancelled a statewide training conference and redirected resources to cover costs.Previous CP3 funding, she said, supported training for law enforcement, schools, and faith institutions in threat prevention.The Trump administration argued the program was misused. In its letter to Minnesota authorities, DHS said CP3 grants were “no longer in line” with its priorities, citing immigration enforcement, border security and combating antisemitism.A Homeland Security official said in a statement that CP3 had been used for “left-wing ideologies and did next to nothing to combat actual threats.” The official also said that many grants had gone to groups that “celebrated and encouraged transgenderism in children,” a remark that drew criticism from Democrats.The cuts also impacted the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, which had received about $100,000 for multidisciplinary threat-assessment work, according to CNN. A former DHS employee told the outlet the Minneapolis attack was “100% preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped.”The assailant, Robin Westman, left behind journals expressing surprise at evading detection. “Should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks,” he wrote, as reported by CNN.In one journal entry, he wrote, “I have been showing signs for a while. I need to be stopped! … If I did something, they would say it was obvious in hindsight.”Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was quoted as saying by CNN that “the capacity to combat domestic terrorism is eroding. It seems like the focus on prevention has slipped in this country.”Minnesota lawmakers criticised the decision. Sen. Tina Smith said, “This shooting was horrific, and to think we had a strategy in place aimed at preventing this type of violence is tragic.”Rep. Betty McCollum added that cancelling the grant “limits our state law enforcement from access to vital federal counterterrorism partners and resources and leaves Minnesota communities more vulnerable.”The attack followed an earlier June assassination plot that killed a state representative and her husband and wounded a senator and his wife, events that further fuel concerns about weakened prevention efforts.After the shooting, US First Lady Melania Trump urged more proactive measures, posting on X, “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioural threat assessments across all levels of society … Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.”","In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.

‘Complex rescue mission’: IDF recovers bodies of two October 7 victims from Gaza; Netanyahu vows to return all hostages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/complex-rescue-mission-idf-recovers-bodies-of-two-october-7-victims-from-gaza-netanyahu-vows-to-return-all-hostages/articleshow/123609186.cms,"File photo: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Picture credit: AP)

Netanyahu's Gaza Plan Faces Opposition By Hostages Kin; Massive Rallies Across Israel | Watch





Israeli security forces have recovered the remains of two people killed in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office confirmed.As per The New York Times, the bodies were identified as 56-year-old Ilan Weiss and 28-year-old Idan Shtivi.The Israeli military and domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet said the operation was a “complex rescue mission,” without disclosing when or where it took place.Weiss, a civilian emergency team leader, was killed in his home community of Be’eri during the attack in which militants raided southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and abducting around 250, according to Israeli officials. His wife, Shiri, and teenage daughter, Noga, were taken hostage but later freed during a ceasefire in November 2023, the NYT reported.Shtivi was killed near the Nova music festival, where 360 people lost their lives and several others were abducted. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said he had gone to the festival grounds to photograph friends.According to The Sun US, Shtivi was abducted from the Tel Gama area, “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists after acting to rescue and evacuate others” from the site. His body was taken to Gaza and held for 693 days before being returned.Netanyahu vowed Israel would not stop its efforts to bring back both living hostages and the dead. “We will not rest or be silent until we return all of our hostages home, both the living and the dead,” he said Friday, as quoted by The Sun US.The recovery of the two bodies comes as Israel intensifies its Gaza offensive. According to the NYT, the Israeli security cabinet has approved a plan to expand operations into Gaza City, where several hundred thousand Palestinians remain.Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s office said, “We will not rest until everyone returns home — this is the objective of the upcoming maneuver.”Palestinian health officials say more than 63,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel’s military campaign. On Saturday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 17 people in Gaza City, while targeting what officials described as a “key” Hamas figure.The war, which began after Hamas’ October 7 assault, has left Israel still holding that around 20 hostages are alive in Gaza, with the bodies of roughly 30 more captives also believed to remain there.","Ilan Weiss, 56, and Idan Shtivi, 28, were killed in Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.

ROUEN: A man intentionally ploughed his car into a crowd outside a wine bar in northern France after an altercation early Saturday, killing one person and injuring five others, two of them critically, prosecutors told AFP.The incident took place in the town of Evreux in the northern French region of Normandy at around 4:00 am Saturday (0200 GMT).An investigation has been opened into homicide and attempted homicide, according to the prosecutors, who ruled out any ""terrorist"" or racist motives.""Unfortunately, the toll is very heavy,"" Evreux public prosecutor Remi Coutin said.One man died at the scene, he added.Five people were injured, and two of them are in critical condition.Coutin said that ""there was an altercation"" between a young woman and several men.The bouncers escorted all the patrons outside the bar located in the centre of the town of around 50,0000 people, the prosecutor said.""One person went to fetch a vehicle"" and ""deliberately reversed at high speed into the crowd outside the establishment"", Coutin added, saying the incident had ""escalated and ended in a terrible tragedy"".Two men, including the car driver, and a woman have been taken into custody, the prosecutor said, adding that further arrests were possible.Guy Lefrand, the mayor of Evreux, expressed his ""deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.""""I commend the rapid response of the police and emergency services,"" he added.When the police arrived, they saw a panicked crowd, with many people under the influence of alcohol, a police source said.The mayor, speaking to broadcaster BFMTV, said the bar should have closed at 1 am.""It is an establishment with a bad reputation,"" added Lefrand.","A man intentionally ploughed his car into a crowd outside a wine bar in northern France after an altercation early Saturday, killing one person.

Germany debates who should cover costs of unhealthy eating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-debates-who-should-cover-costs-of-unhealthy-eating/articleshow/123609322.cms,"



When Lucas Pohl boarded a flight last summer, he didn't know it would mark a turning point in his life. The Berlin resident had always carried extra weight, but when he couldn't fasten his seatbelt and had to ask for an extender, ""something inside me broke,"" the 27-year-old said. Pohl, who weighed 150kg at the time, had been eating mostly cheap junk food and ready-made meals while earning ₹1,000 ($1,170) a month as a trainee. Fearing for his health, he decided to check into an obesity clinic.Public health insurance in Germany doesn't pay for the use of drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss, but Pohl was able to access nutritional counselling and bariatric surgery. His insurance covered the costs, which came to ₹10,000 ($11,687) in total, and he continued to receive his salary during his three-week leave after the procedure.About half of adults in Germany are overweight, with obesity rates projected to keep rising if current trends continue. Researchers have linked this to Germans' low vegetable intake and sugar-heavy diets.In a country where mandatory insurance means health care costs are shared by the public, the lack of oversight around unhealthy food is a political issue. Obesity and its associated diseases not only ""cause a great deal of human suffering, they also incur extremely high costs,"" said Barbara Bitzer, MD of the German Diabetes Society.Estimates put the economic toll of weight-related health problems at between $31.55 billion and over $100 billion a year, further straining a system already under financial duress.Chancellor Friedrich Merz promised to initiate a ""fundamental reform"" of social security systems this year, yet a policy plan released in spring by the ruling coalition made no mention of nutrition or unhealthy eating, which directly impact health care costs. Instead, it called on consumers to ""make their own decisions.""For members of the Greens and the Left, that's not enough. The parties are pushing measures such as sugar taxes on soft drink makers - an effort the conservative CDU/CSU opposes, trusting markets to self-correct. At a moment in which much political discourse in Germany is focused on the divide between populist factions and establishment parties, the debate over food regulation shows the classic tension between market freedom and state intervention is still very alive.While Germany doesn't levy so-called ""sin taxes"" on products deemed harmful, it does have a system in which foods are taxed at either 7% or 19% depending on whether they're essential. The idea is to ensure that basic necessities are always affordable, yet critics have attacked the VAT model as full of inconsistencies, noting that pet food falls into the cheaper tax bracket while baby food does not.Having failed to take key steps in food legislation during their four years in the previous govt - an outcome blamed on their pro-market coalition partner - Green party lawmakers are once again calling for VAT reform. In this, they do have public support. An effort to remove the value-added tax on healthy foods has been met with 91% public approval. Separately, a proposed sugar tax on soft drink makers has the backing of 79% of Germans.","About half of adults in Germany are overweight, with obesity rates projected to keep rising.

Trump Aide's Big Hint





In a major development of the H-1B row, the US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.The programme, which allows foreign workers to fill roles in the US, has long been criticised for limiting opportunities for native-born Americans.Assistant attorney general for Civil Rights, Harmeet Dhillon, confirmed to Patrick Reports that the department of justice’s (DoJ) civil rights division is actively investigating civil rights complaints linked to the H-1B programme.“Through our Protecting US Workers Initiative, the Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights section has numerous open investigations into hiring practices that discriminate against American citizens, and the list continues to grow,” InfoWars quoted Dhillon.She further added, “We encourage anyone aware of such practices to notify the Civil Rights Division so we can determine if an investigation and enforcement action is needed.”The Indian-American Trump aide took to social media platform X calling out people to send leads against employers.“We have several open investigations and have taken action against some employers already! Send us your leads!”Dhillon has long criticized the H-1B system.""The H1B system is broken and needs reform. What does that have to do with medical education? Nothing, and it’s lazy to conflate the two broken systems,"" she had said earlier.The H-1B visa programme is capped at 85,000 new visas per year, excluding renewals for existing holders. Workers on these visas are often dependent on their employers for legal status, allowing companies to treat them more harshly than American employees and giving them an advantage in the hiring process.The Trump-era department of labour (DOL) also faced scrutiny from the Office of Inspector General over its handling of H-2B applications.While critics argue that the system continues to favour foreign workers, the DOJ’s renewed focus on protecting American employees offers a potential turning point. Citizen activists and job-seekers are now calling for continued pressure to ensure cases of H-1B-related discrimination are prosecuted and legal precedents are set to protect non-visa workers.","The US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.

‘Forcibly removed’: Senator Ron Wyden warns against Trump admin's plan to deport over 600 Guatemalan children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forcibly-removed-senator-ron-wyden-warns-against-trump-admins-plan-to-deport-over-600-guatemalan-children/articleshow/123593917.cms,"Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon (Pic credit: AP)

Guatemala willing to take back minors

‘Forcibly removed’ without asylum

Advocacy groups slam move





The Trump administration is preparing to deport nearly 700 Guatemalan children who entered the United States without their parents, according to a letter sent Friday by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, reported AP.In his letter to Angie Salazar, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the Department of Health and Human Services, Wyden warned that such removals would violate the ORR’s “child welfare mandate” and America’s long-standing obligation towards unaccompanied minors.“This move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,” Wyden wrote, urging the administration to scrap the plan.The planned deportations are part of the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which includes surging enforcement officers to Chicago, escalating deportations, and rolling back protections for migrants who had been allowed to live and work in the US.Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said his government had informed Washington that it was prepared to take in several hundred children currently held in US facilities.He noted particular concern for minors who risk being transferred to adult detention centres once they turn 18.The number under discussion is a little over 600—almost double the 341 minors the country had previously agreed to repatriate, officials confirmed. Danilo Rivera, director of Guatemala’s Immigration Institute, had earlier said the aim was to bring the children back before they reached adulthood. He added that the process would be managed at Guatemala’s expense and would be classified as “voluntary return.”President Bernardo Arévalo has backed the plan, stressing that the government has both a legal and moral duty to advocate for the children. His comments followed a visit to Guatemala by US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.Wyden’s letter, citing whistleblowers, claimed that children without a parent or legal guardian as a sponsor, or without an active asylum case, “will be forcibly removed from the country.”“Unaccompanied children are some of the most vulnerable children entrusted to the government’s care,” he wrote. “In many cases, these children and their families have had to make the unthinkable choice to face danger and separation in search of safety.”Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services commented on the matter, which was first reported by CNN.The proposal has alarmed immigrant rights advocates. “We are outraged by the Trump administration’s renewed assault on the rights of immigrant children,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “We are not fooled by their attempt to mask these efforts as mere ‘repatriations.’ This is yet another calculated attempt to sever what little due process remains in the immigration system. ”Children traveling to the US without parents or guardians are typically handed over to ORR upon apprehension at the border. They are placed in government-supervised shelters or foster care until a sponsor—often a family member—is identified. Many also seek asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas reserved for victims of exploitation.Advocates have already challenged in court the Trump administration’s tougher vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, arguing that the changes are inhumane and prolong family separations.",Guatemala willing to take back hundreds of children who entered the US without their parents.

‘You can’t mimic the king’: JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts; calls it ‘cheap imitation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-mimic-the-king-jd-vance-again-mocks-gavin-newsoms-donald-trump-style-posts-calls-it-cheap-imitation/articleshow/123580503.cms,"JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts (Picture credit: AP)

The Chaos That Erupted Just Moments Before Vance Was Booed At Union Station Revealed





US Vice President JD Vance has again criticised California Governor Gavin Newsom’s new social media strategy, saying his attempt to copy President Donald Trump ’s style lacks authenticity.In an interview with Fox News host Will Cain, Vance argued that Newsom cannot replicate Trump’s appeal. “He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work. You can't mimic the king. You can’t mimic the master; you ought to just go and be yourself. And I think the people would like that a lot more than a cheap imitation of the president of the United States,” he said.The comments follow a string of posts from Newsom’s press office in August that mirrored Trump’s online persona — using capital letters, mocking nicknames and emphatic sign-offs.One viral post declared, “WOW! TOMORROW HISTORY WILL BE MADE… DONALD ‘THE FAILURE’ TRUMP BE WARNED, TOMORROW MAY BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. LIBERATION DAY FOR AMERICA!!! — GCN.”Cain noted that the approach may be resonating with Democrats, pointing to a Morning Consult poll showing Newsom’s support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rose by eight points between June and late August.However, Vance dismissed the tactic as inauthentic. “When I see Gavin Newsom trying to act like Donald Trump, that’s the opposite of authenticity.He’s not trying to be Gavin Newsom — whoever that is. He’s trying to be a fake carbon copy of Donald Trump, and it just doesn’t work,” he said.Vance emphasised that Trump’s enduring influence comes from being genuine. “The lesson of President Trump in American politics is you’ve got to be authentic to yourself,” he added. “People liked his posts because they spoke to his authenticity. With Newsom, it’s a cheap replication.”Newsom defended his approach earlier this month, saying he wanted to highlight the double standards around Trump’s social media behaviour. “I’m sort of following his example,” he said in a press conference, according to The Wrap. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”In an earlier interview, Vance has also warned Democrats more broadly against drawing the wrong lesson from Trump’s success. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style — I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” he said on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle.Vance went further, offering blunt advice, “The autopsy for the Democrats… is stop sounding like crazy people. Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic.”","JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts. ‘He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work.

At least three people were killed after protesters set ablaze a council building in Makassar, eastern Indonesia, officials said on Saturday.The nationwide unrest spread following the death of a young motorcycle taxi driver hit by a police vehicle.“From last night’s incident, three people died. Two at the scene and one at the hospital. They were trapped in the burning building,” Makassar city council secretary Rahmat Mappatoba told AFP. He accused protesters of storming and torching the office.The unrest was triggered by the death of 21-year-old driver Affan Kurniawan, who was run over and killed by an armoured police vehicle near Jakarta’s parliament on Thursday evening.Demonstrations had originally been fuelled by anger over unemployment, rising living costs, and lawmakers’ new housing allowance package, which critics say is around 10 times higher than Jakarta’s monthly minimum wage of 50 million rupiahs (£2,254).His death ignited fury, with protests spreading across cities by Friday. In Jakarta, hundreds marched towards the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade anti-riot police.Some tried to storm the compound, prompting police to fire tear gas. Protesters retaliated by torching a police post and several cars nearby.Indonesian President Subianto Prabowo issued public apologies. “I am shocked and disappointed by the excessive actions of the officers,” Prabowo said, promising accountability.Violent clashes between stone-pelting demonstrators and police erupted in several Indonesian cities, including Surabaya, Solo, Yogyakarta, Medan, Makassar, Manado, Bandung and Manokwari in Papua’s easternmost region.","The nationwide unrest spread following the death of a young motorcycle taxi driver hit by a police vehicle.

A dramatic police video has captured the moments before a 35-year-old Sikh man, wielding a machete near Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles was fatally shot by officers in July this year.The incident took place on the morning of July 13, when multiple 911 callers reported a man brandishing a large blade at passersby at the busy intersection of Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard.Police later identified him as Gurpreet Singh LAPD released footage of the incident on its YouTube channel yesterday, where Singh is seen apparently performing G, a traditional Sikh martial art, in the middle of the street.According to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Singh abandoned his car in the middle of the road, waved the machete aggressively and, at one point, even appeared to slice his own tongue with the weapon.Officers said they repeatedly ordered him to drop the blade, but he refused to comply.Singh briefly returned to his vehicle, retrieved a water bottle and hurled it at police before driving off while sticking the machete out of the window. Officers launched a short pursuit during which Singh allegedly drove erratically and collided with a police vehicle.He finally came to a stop near Figueroa and 12th Streets, where police said he charged at them with the weapon. Officers opened fire, striking Singh.He was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.The LAPD said a two-foot-long machete was recovered from the scene. No officers or civilians were hurt in the ordeal.","LA Police shoot dead Sikh man performing gatka on LA road.

US health officials have raised a travel alert for China’s Guangdong province after a surge in cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne illness known to cause prolonged joint pain.According to the New York Post, the center for disease control and prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 2 travel warning, advising visitors to “practice enhanced precautions” when visiting the region. Foshan city has been identified as the epicentre of the outbreak, prompting containment steps that some compare to early COVID-era measures.Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said. Chikungunya is spread through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in warm, humid climates, but not through person-to-person contact. While rarely fatal, the illness can cause intense joint pain lasting weeks, months or even years.The CDC has urged travellers to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding mosquito breeding sites, and staying in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Two vaccines against chikungunya have recently been approved for use in the United States, but pregnant women - particularly those nearing delivery - are advised to reconsider travel as the virus can, in rare cases, be transmitted during childbirth.Globally, an estimated 35 million people contract chikungunya each year, though annual deaths are relatively low at around 3,700. In the US, 46 travel-related cases have been reported so far in 2025, compared with nearly 200 in 2024. No locally transmitted cases have been recorded in the country since 2019, according to the CDC.Older adults, newborns, and people with chronic health conditions remain at greater risk of severe or long-term complications from the illness, the agency added.","Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said.

The shocking incident took place Wednesday afternoon at a Loblaws store on Baseline Road, where the victim was shopping with a friend.Ottawa Police Service confirmed Friday that the assault is being investigated as a 'hate-motivated' crime.Police said the attacker, who did not know her, approached and stabbed her without provocation. She was critically injured but survived after being rushed to hospital.The suspect, identified as Joseph Rooke, 71, of Cornwall, Ontario, was arrested at the scene.

"A walk through a Smithsonian museum reveals American genius, cruelty as Trump presses for change",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-walk-through-a-smithsonian-museum-reveals-american-genius-cruelty-as-trump-presses-for-change/articleshow/123609298.cms,"There are many provocations

The American spirit is celebrated, too





In an afternoon's walk through ground zero of Americana — the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History — objects around every corner invite one question: What could possibly be more American than this?There's the enormous Star-Spangled Banner in all its timeworn glory, Dorothy's ruby slippers from “The Wizard of Oz"" and totems of achievement throughout.There are also testaments to pain and cruelty. What could be more American than a reckoning with the nation's sins, as illustrated by shackles representing slavery and photos of Japanese Americans confined to detention camps in World War II?In myriad ways, the museum explores “the complexity of our past,"" in accord with its mission statement. President Donald Trump wants a simpler tale told. He wants this and the other Smithsonian museums to mirror American pride, power and accomplishment without all the darkness, and he threatens to hold back money if they don't get with that programme.American genius and ugliness are on displayOn social media, Trump complained that at the Smithsonian museums, which are free to visit and get most of their money from the government, “everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.”In fact, the history museum reflects bountiful successes, whether on the battlefield, from the kitchens and factories of food pioneers, on the musical stage, in the movies or on other fronts of creativity and industriousness.The American Enterprise exhibit, for one, has a wall filled with the stories of successful Americans.On this wandering tour you can see navigational implements used by Blackbeard, the terrifying pirate, from his early 1700s raids on the Atlantic coast. You see the hat Abraham Lincoln wore to Ford's Theatre the night of his assassination, George Washington's ceremonial uniform, Warren Harding's fine red silk pajamas from the early 1900s, the first car to travel across the country, and a USD 100,000 bill.You can see the original light bulbs of the American genius, Thomas Edison. A much earlier genius, the founding father Benjamin Franklin, is presented both as a gifted inventor and a slave owner who publicly came to denounce slavery yet never freed his own.Those nuances and ambiguities may not be long for this world. Still on display at the history museum are artifacts and documents of American ingenuity, subjugation, generosity, racism, grit, dishonour, verve, playfulness, corruption, heroism, and cultural appropriation.Like most museums, the focus is not on the future.Even so, there is plenty to provoke the Republican president.In the “Great Debate” of an American democracy exhibition, a wall is emblazoned with large words such as “Privilege” and “Slavery.” The museum presents fulsome tributes to the contributions of immigrants and narratives about the racist landscape that many encountered.Exhibits address “food justice,"" the exploitation of Filipinos after the United States annexed their land and the network of oppressive Native American boarding schools from which Jim Thorpe emerged and became one of the greatest athletes of all time.Hawaii's last sovereign before its annexation by the US in the 1890s, Queen Liliuokalani, is quoted on a banner as asking: “Is the AMERICAN REPUBLIC of STATES to DEGENERATE and become a COLONIZER?”A ukulele on display was made around 1890 by a sugar laborer who worked on the kingdom's American plantations before a US-backed coup overthrew the monarchy. Museum visitors are told the new instrument was held up by the monarchs as a symbol of anti-colonial independence.“Ukuleles are both a product of US imperialism and a potent symbol of Native Hawaiian resistance,” says the accompanying text.At the Greek-godlike statue of George Washington, the text hints at his complexities and stops short of the total reverence that totalitarian leaders get.Noting that “modern scholarship focuses on the fallible man rather than the marble hero,” the text says Washington's image “is still used for inspiration, patriotism and commercial gain” and that “he continues to hold a place for many as a symbolic father' of the country.”On this visit, conservators behind a big window are seen sweeping tiny brushes on ancient wooden pieces. Their patriotic work proceeds at a snail's pace.The team is restoring the gunboat Philadelphia, part of a small fleet that engaged the British navy at the Battle of Valcour Island in Lake Champlain in 1776, delaying Britain's effort to cut off the New England colonies and buying time for the Continental Army to prepare for its decisive victory at Saratoga.The commander of the gunboats in the Valcour battle later became America's greatest traitor, Benedict Arnold. The British damaged the Philadelphia so badly it sank an hour after the battle, then lay underwater for 160 years. It's being restored for next year's celebrations of America's 250th year.“The Philadelphia is a symbol of how citizens of a newly formed nation came together, despite overwhelming odds against their success,” said Jennifer Jones, the project's director. “This boat's fragile condition is symbolic of our democracy; it requires the nation's attention and vigilance to preserve it for future generations.”It's not telling you what to think, but what to think aboutDemocracy's fragility is considered in a section of the museum about the limits of presidential power. That's where references to Trump's two impeachments were removed in July for updating, and were restored this month.“On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” one label now states. “On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,"" says another. ""The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on January 6.” His Senate acquittals are duly noted.It's a just-the-facts take on a matter that has driven the country so deeply apart. The history museum doesn't offer answers for that predicament. Instead, it asks questions throughout its halls on the fundamentals of Americanism.“How should Americans remember their Revolution and the founding of the nation?”“What does patriotism look like?”“How diverse should the citizenry be?”“Do we need to share a common national story?”","The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History explores the complexity of our past.

Makeup, cameras, and awkward excuses

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn’t normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump’s health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of “overzealous handshakes.”“A woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than “soft tissue irritation” from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was “no evidence of heart failure or serious illness.” But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, “You see the president every day, he’s working, he’s moving, he’s continuing.”Not everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association’s vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump’s hand is “unrelated to venous insufficiency.” Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

NEW YORK: An American Jewish advocacy group has slammed US officials for criticising India for its purchase of Russian oil, asserting that New Delhi is ""not responsible"" for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and called for a ""reset"" of US-India ties.Trump administration members have lately upped their criticism of India for buying energy from Moscow, saying that this is ""funding"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war machine"" in the whole Ukraine conflict.The remarks by the American Jewish Committee on Friday came after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro called the conflict ""Modi's war"" and said that the ""road to peace"" runs partly ""right through New Delhi"".In a social media post, the Jewish advocacy group said it was ""mystified and deeply troubled by the chorus of attacks on India by US officials"", and called Navarro's remarks a ""scurrilous charge"".""We regret energy-hungry India's reliance on Russian oil -- but India isn't responsible for Putin's war crimes, is a sister democracy and an increasingly important strategic partner of the United States, and has a crucial role to play in Great Power competition,"" it said.

At 19, Barron Trump may be the youngest member of the Trump family, but insiders say his place among the siblings tells a story of contrasts. While Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric grew up together under Donald Trump’s first marriage to Ivana, Barron was born more than two decades later to Melania, a gap that has shaped how he relates to his brothers and sisters.Those close to the family say Barron has never quite clicked with his older siblings. “It’s not tension so much as distance,” one insider told Daily Mail, noting that the age difference left Barron more like a nephew than a brother to the Trump trio. Tiffany Trump , however, is different. At 31, she is the closest in age to Barron and, like him, grew up away from the family’s first household. Tiffany was raised by Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, which, some say, gave her an understanding of Barron’s “outsider” position in the family.That bond is evident on Tiffany’s social media, where she has posted heartfelt birthday messages to her youngest brother. One from 2020 reads: “Happy 14th birthday to the best ‘little’ brother I could ever ask for! You mean so much to me, Barron… Love you!” Another photo from 2021 shows the pair smiling together next to a giant Minnie Mouse.Melania has often described Barron as “mini Donald,” but unlike his father, the NYU student is shy and reserved. Those who know him say Tiffany’s warmth and protective streak make her the sibling he trusts most.As Barron grows into adulthood, it’s Tiffany, not Ivanka, Eric, or Donald Jr, who seems poised to remain his closest confidant, giving the Trump dynasty’s youngest member an anchor within the sprawling, complicated family.","At 19, Barron Trump may be the youngest member of the Trump family, but insiders say his place among the siblings tells a story of contrasts.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris is about to step into some of the most public arenas of her post-White House career, but without the government protection once guaranteed to her.President Donald Trump has ordered Harris’ Secret Service detail to be cut off as of September 1, according to a directive sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The move, first reported August 29, comes just days before Harris launches a 15-city book tour for 107 Days, her account of the 2024 campaign.For Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, the loss of federal protection creates a dangerous gap.Private security firms, even when staffed by ex-Secret Service agents, simply can’t match the intelligence sharing, manpower, or legal authority of the real thing, experts warn, reported US Today.“Whether it’s crowd control, motorcades, or defending against cyber and chemical threats, you’re just not going to get it from the private sector,” AT Smith, former deputy director of the Secret Service, was quoted as saying.The decision puts Harris in the same category as John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Robert O’Brien, and Dr Anthony Fauci, all of whom saw their taxpayer-funded security abruptly canceled under Trump, even as some faced active threats from hostile governments.The law only guarantees six months of Secret Service coverage for former vice presidents. But Joe Biden quietly extended Harris’ detail for a year after leaving office, a courtesy Trump has now revoked.The legality is murky. DHS has final say, and officials are supposed to review classified threat assessments before pulling protection. It’s unclear if that happened here.California allies, including Gov Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, are already weighing how to keep Harris safe. And Democrats in Washington see Trump’s order as yet another weaponization of presidential power.“Another dangerous reminder that there’s no agenda more important to Donald Trump than retribution,” said Rep. Adam Schiff. “He feeds conspiracy theories to his followers. Makes their targets more vulnerable. Then pulls their security.”","Kamala Harris' Secret Service detail will be cut off as of September 1, according to a directive sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Investigators in Minneapolis, US, have gathered extensive evidence from the mass shooting at a Catholic school and church on Wednesday, according to search warrants. The recovered items include a cache of weapons and a device that may have been a smoke bomb.The gunman, identified as transgender shooter Robin Westman, killed two children and injured 18 parishioners. According to NBC News, search warrants show Westman was carrying a Taurus semiautomatic pistol, a Mossberg pump-action shotgun, and a Magpul semiautomatic rifle.In total, police collected 158 personal items linked to Westman, including hard drives, from multiple locations. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the firearms were purchased recently through legal means and that Westman had no documented history of mental illness, the New York Post reported.At the scene, police recovered more than 116 shell casings, confirming that Westman fired into the church where middle school students had gathered. A wooden board with a gas container and a metal pull pin, possibly meant to function as a smoke bomb, was also seized.Other items recovered included a knife, green fingerless gloves, black mechanic gloves, headphones, and a gray zip-up sweatshirt.Authorities said Westman arrived at the church in a commercial van registered to his father, James Westman.A rifle case was recovered from the van, which had been left parked behind the church with one rear door open.From the father’s home in nearby Richfield, investigators seized a tactical vest, two external media storage devices, an iPhone, a USB drive, and more than 150 other pieces of evidence.The shooting killed Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, who were in the pews of Annunciation Church just before 8:30 am (local time), when gunfire came through the stained-glass windows. Several others were wounded.","Robin Westman, identified as transgender shooter, killed two children and injured 18 parishioners.

Former US President Bill Clinton is facing renewed questions about his health after being seen in the Hamptons carrying what appeared to be a portable defibrillator.Several visuals of Clinton have gone viral on social media, sparking concerns about his health.

Hillary was seen holding a device resembling a Propaq MD Air Medical Bag, Fox News reported.The sighting comes just two months after Clinton was seen stumbling on a New York City sidewalk outside the 92NY cultural center while attending an event for his book, First Gentleman, a political thriller co-authored with James Patterson.Clinton’s health challenges have been public for over two decades. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery, after doctors discovered nearly complete blockages in several arteries.He later admitted in an interview with Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America that he had ignored warning signs and urged others with a family history of heart disease to get tested.""That was my fault. I don't blame my doctors or anybody else.… I was insufficiently vigilant,"" Clinton said.In 2010, Clinton underwent another heart procedure in which coronary stents were inserted following chest pain.

Katz’s Delicatessen in New York City displayed his order, which included two hot dogs, a pastrami sandwich, fries, a diet ginger ale and a decaf coffee.More recently, Clinton has faced additional health challenges, including hospitalization for a urinary tract infection in 2021, a Covid-19 infection in 2022, and another hospitalization for the flu.","Former US President Bill Clinton is facing renewed questions about his health after being seen in the Hamptons carrying what appeared to be a portable defibrillator.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) on Friday described the national election scheduled for February next year as the ""most risky” in the country's electoral history, urging officials to brace for unpredictable challenges amid political uncertainty and social unrest.The remarks came a day after it unveiled a roadmap for the election, which has drawn mixed reactions from political parties.""The upcoming general election will undoubtedly be the most risky in Bangladesh's electoral history,” Election Commissioner M Anwarul Islam Sarker said at a training programme for election officials, which was also attended by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin.""We may have to confront challenges that we do not yet know,” he said. Unveiling the roadmap for the general election, Bangladesh's top electoral body had said the poll schedule would be announced at least 60 days before the voting date.Another election commissioner, Abdur Rahmanel Masud, echoed Sarker's concern, saying that the upcoming election ""will be risky but the matter does not end there”.“A former CEC was recently garlanded with shoes (by a mob), while another is currently in jail,"" he said, urging officials to “just follow the law” and not to look to anyone else.CEC Uddin stressed professionalism and neutrality, directing officials to prepare for possible threats to law and order as well as the spread of misinformation and disinformation through social media.The commission “wants 100 per cent neutral behaviour from election officials in the upcoming polls”, he said.The upcoming polls will be the first since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024, following the violent protest led by Students Against Discrimination (SAD).Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has since been heading the interim government as Chief Adviser, with the Awami League barred from contesting the election pending trials of Hasina and her colleagues on charges, including crimes against humanity.While former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and several left-leaning groups have welcomed the election roadmap, Jamaat-e-Islami on Friday rejected it as a “blueprint” to ""undermine free, fair election”.Jamaat leader Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher, in a meeting with election officials in Cumilla district, accused Yunus of breaking his “promise"" by prematurely announcing the election deadline.The Islamist party was demanding the introduction of a proportional representation (PR) system in the polls, apparently to enhance its possible stake in the future parliament.Taher said the deadline was announced without taking a decision on the matter and other reform issues.The newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) -- an offshoot of the SAD seen as sympathetic to Yunus -- has also expressed reservations against the planned polls under the existing system and scenario.The party, which is yet to get the EC registration, described the roadmap as a “breach of promise”.NCP Joint Convener Ariful Islam Adeeb, in a press conference, warned that “this misstep” could create future crises for which “the government must bear responsibility"".The party is pushing for a new constitution to replace the 1972 charter through a Constituent Assembly. It is demanding that the “July Charter” announced by Yunus earlier this month, acknowledging last year’s “revolution”, be implemented through the new constitution.Analysts have voiced concerns over whether a credible election can be held in the absence of the Awami League. They also warned that escalating mob violence and the current fragile law and order situation could also jeopardise the process.However, BNP, which has emerged as the single major party in Awami League's absence, sounded upbeat.“Everything has been done according to public expectations. I hope there will be no more irrelevant questions about the election now,” BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.Yunus had earlier said the polls under his administration would be “the best” Bangladesh had “ever witnessed” in its history.","Bangladesh's Election Commission urges officials to brace for unpredictable challenges.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

Feud at Diana’s grave: Prince William and Prince Harry split over mother's 30th death anniversary films,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/feud-at-dianas-grave-prince-william-and-prince-harry-split-over-mothers-30th-death-anniversary-films/articleshow/123608238.cms,"Prince Harry's Fears Confirmed With Royal Family's Prince George Move? Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

UK PM Keir Starmer replaces third top aide in less than a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-keir-starmer-replaces-third-top-aide-in-less-than-a-year/articleshow/123607433.cms,"



LONDON: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is replacing his principal private secretary (PPS) Ninjeri Pandit, who has held the role since Oct 2024, as he attempts to reboot his govt after a torrid first year in power. She is the third top aide he has replaced in less than a year.Chief of staff Sue Gray left in Oct and director of communications Matthew Doyle stepped down in March.The PPS to the PM is a civil servant who runs the PM’s private office acting as a gatekeeper to the PM, running his diary and interacting with ministers, officials and advisers.Nin Pandit will move into a newly created role next week leading on policy delivery at No. 10, Downing Street confirmed.Sources said that the PM had decided to “take more direct oversight of delivery” and bring that into No. 10.The BBC claimed that Pandit was being replaced because Starmer was concerned she was “ineffective” in the PPS role. The Guido Fawkes website quoted a Downing Street source saying Pandit was “hopeless and seems to dislike everyone and everything with no ability to fix things”.However No. 10 sources told TOI on Saturday this was absolutely not true.Prior to her PPS role, Pandit ran the No. 10 Policy Unit from Nov 2022, under Rishi Sunak’s premiership.The shake-up of the No. 10 operation comes as support for Labour has collapsed to a historic low of 20%, the party’s lowest rating since July 2019 when Jeremy Corbyn led the party. The latest polls put Reform UK at 15 points ahead of Labour. Starmer’s personal approval has plummeted to -44 net favourability, one of the lowest ratings for a sitting PM.Starmer’s govt is under huge pressure to address the small boats crisis. More than 50,000 illegal migrants have crossed the English Channel since Labour came into power in July 2024, a 38% increase on the year before. There have been widespread protests outside asylum hotels throughout the summer, triggered after several migrants staying in them were charged with criminal offences. This is all a gift to Reform UK which recently announced it would deport all illegal migrants.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is replacing his principal private secretary (PPS) Ninjeri Pandit.

A new book claims that Britain’s late Queen Elizabeth II did not support Brexit but was critical of European Union bureaucracy., written by former royal correspondent Valentine Low, explores the relationship between the monarchy and government and how the withdrawal of the UK from the EU was viewed within the royal household.By convention, the Queen never took part in politics and never publicly referred to Brexit, with Buckingham Palace making it clear that the Monarch remained neutral. But almost three years after her death, it has been reported that she was unhappy with the idea of leaving the EU and was frustrated by Brussels bureaucracy, the UK Mirror reported.According to the book, the Queen told a senior minister more than three months before the Brexit referendum that ""we shouldn’t leave the EU"", adding: ""It’s better to stick with the devil you know.""A palace insider quoted in the book said the Queen saw the EU as part of the post-war settlement, which marked cooperation after two world wars.The late Queen was also reported to have expressed irritation with EU bureaucracy, once remarking ""this is ridiculous"" while reading the papers.The Times, citing the book, said the Queen’s comments to the minister came as they discussed the referendum. The paper also reported that she viewed the EU as part of the post-war settlement, ""marking an era of cooperation after two world wars.""Former Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""She was so careful never to express a political view, but you always sensed that, like most of her subjects, she thought that European co-operation was necessary and important, but the institutions of the EU sometimes can be infuriating.""In the 2016 referendum, Leave won with 52 per cent of the vote, against 42 per cent for Remain.","New book claims that Britain’s late Queen Elizabeth II was unhappy with the idea of leaving the EU.

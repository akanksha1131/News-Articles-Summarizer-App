Biden urges Congress to pass stronger gun laws

President offers support to victims' families

Wisconsin school shooting

US President Joe Biden condemned the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin , which killed a teacher and a teenage student and injured others. He called for immediate action from Congress on gun safety legislation.Biden expressed grief for the victims and their families. He stressed the need to protect children from gun violence.“Today, families in Madison, Wisconsin, are grieving the loss of those who were killed and wounded at Abundant Life Christian School. It’s shocking and unconscionable,” Biden said in a White House statement.“We need Congress to act. Now,"" he added.The President pointed to other school shootings, including those in Newtown, Uvalde, and Parkland, and stressed the widespread nature of gun violence impacting children.“From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings that don’t receive attention – it is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept it as normal. Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom. Students across our country should be learning how to read and write – not having to learn how to duck and cover.”Biden said that his administration has implemented gun safety measures, including passing legislation and creating a White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention . He also noted his executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence. However, he reiterated the need for Congress to pass further laws, including universal background checks, a national red flag law, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.“My administration has taken aggressive action to combat the gun violence epidemic. We passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, I have taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other President in history, and I created the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. But more is needed. Congress must pass commonsense gun safety laws: Universal background checks. A national red flag law. A ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”The President offered support to local officials and expressed gratitude for the first responders.“Jill and I are praying for all the victims today, including the teacher and teenage student who were killed and those who sustained injuries. We are grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene, and the FBI is supporting local law enforcement efforts. At my direction, my team has reached out to local officials to offer further support as needed.”He concluded by saying, “We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart.”A shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday morning left two people dead and at least six injured. The suspect, a juvenile believed to be a student, was also found deceased inside the school.Police responded to the active shooter report at 10:57 am local time.

Drone mystery 'extremely unsettling': Ex-CIA officer raises chilling theory behind recent sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drone-mystery-extremely-unsettling-ex-cia-officer-raises-chilling-theory-behind-recent-sightings/articleshow/116384529.cms,"Laura Ballman, a former CIA operations officer, demanded that the federal government provide a clearer explanation for the increasing drone activity.

A former CIA officer has proposed a chilling theory behind the recent surge in drone sightings across the Northeast, suggesting that the mysterious flying objects could be part of a “classified exercise” authorized by the Biden administration .In a Saturday interview with Fox News Live, Laura Ballman , a former CIA operations officer, demanded that the federal government provide a clearer explanation for the increasing drone activity. “Now, in terms of who is behind this, deducing the statements that have been made by John Kirby, who has said that these objects are not operating illegally, coupled with the several op-eds that have been out the last 24 hours about the need to look at our detection systems, makes me think, perhaps, this is actually a classified exercise to test either evasion technology or detection technology in urban areas,” Ballman speculated.Her remarks came amid federal officials downplaying the public's concerns over the drone sightings. Ballman, however, expressed concern over the lack of transparency from the government, stating, “In terms of why the federal government would not be more forthcoming, I’ve actually been troubled by that. If I were in a position to advise on this, I would say it’s time to become more transparent.”On the same day, an FBI official dismissed the growing hysteria surrounding the sightings during a call hosted by senior Biden administration officials. According to Fox News, the official downplayed the situation, saying, “We’re doing our best to find the origin of those specific…those drone activities,” but added, “I think there has been a slight overreaction.” The official also revealed that the FBI had received approximately 5,000 tips regarding drone sightings, though only about 100 required further investigation.Despite the federal reassurances, Ballman’s theory has added fuel to the fire, sparking further speculation about the true nature of the drone activity. As the debate continues, both federal and local authorities are under increasing pressure to clarify the origin and purpose of the drones flying through US airspace.","Laura Ballman, a former CIA operations officer, suggested that the mysterious flying objects could be part of a ""classified exercise"" The remarks came amid federal officials downplaying the public's concerns over the drone sightings.

The Allegations



'H6'



Yang's denial



Prince Andrew's role



China responds



A Chinese businessman with close ties to Prince Andrew has denied allegations of espionage after being named by British authorities as a suspected Chinese agent.Yang Tengbo , previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.Yang, 50, has been accused by Britain’s home office of working for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an arm of China’s Communist Party that reportedly builds ties with influential individuals worldwide. Authorities allege Yang engaged in “covert and deceptive activity” on behalf of the UFWD and posed a national security threat .Judges sided with M15, Britain's domestic intelligence, saying that Yang ""represented a risk to national security"" and dismissed his appeal.The SIAC disclosed that in 2021, authorities discovered documents highlighting Yang's close relationship with Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III.In February 2023, Yang was removed from a flight from Beijing to London and subsequently banned from entering the UK. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld the ban last Thursday, bringing his links to Prince Andrew into public view for the first time.The Chinese national, referred as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles. H6 is believed to be among more than 40,000 operatives linked to the department operating across the globe.Responding to the allegations, Yang insisted he was innocent: “I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the home office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.”His lawyer, Guy Vassall-Adams, sidelined the claims and confirmed Yang waived his anonymity to defend his reputation.SIAC’s ruling revealed that evidence from Yang’s phone showed Prince Andrew had authorised him to establish an “international financial initiative” to engage with Chinese investors. However, the ruling provided no details about the purpose of the fund.On Friday, Prince Andrew said he had “ceased all contact” with Yang once concerns about the businessman were brought to his attention. Requests for further comment from the Prince’s office remain unanswered.China's foreign ministry dismissed the accusations, calling them groundless. A spokesperson said, ""China has lways been open and above board and has never engaged in deception or interference. Such speculation is not worth refuting.""","Yang Tengbo, previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.

He further clarified that, ""Some of it's manned, some of it's unmanned,"" underscoring the variety of aircraft involved. ""We absolutely acknowledge that a lot of these are probably drones, but they're flying legally.""With over 1 million drones registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Kirby stressed that the presence of drones in the sky is far from unusual. ""It is legal to fly drones in nonrestricted airspace as long as you're registered with the FAA,"" he explained. ""And there’s thousands and thousands of these kinds of flights every single day.""The federal government has faced a surge in reports regarding drones, especially around New Jersey, with the FBI receiving approximately 5,000 tips. However, only about 100 of these warranted further investigation. ""We have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,"" Kirby said.In response to speculation over a potential national security threat, Kirby reiterated, ""If there was actually a national security threat, I would say so."" He explained that many of the reports are either duplicative or involve misidentified aircraft, including manned fixed-wing planes, helicopters, or even stars.Looking ahead, the White House is calling for more oversight, urging Congress to address concerns over airspace congestion . ""When Congress reconvenes in January after the holiday break, the White House will call for a bipartisan task force to look into congestion in the skies and to help set appropriate rules to address the public’s concerns,"" Kirby announced.Kirby also responded to President-elect Donald Trump’s comments alleging that the Biden administration knows more about the drones than it has shared. ""There’s absolutely no effort to be anything other than upfront as we can be,"" Kirby stated. ""I would say that we are making a very good-faith effort to be as open and direct with all of you and with the American people as we can and that will continue.""","The White House reiterated on Tuesday that recent sightings of drones across the Northeast pose no national security threat.

The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught,” said Assad.Earlier, news agency AFP citing multiple former officials reported that the former Syrian president had already fled the country before rebel forces captured Damascus and overthrew his administration.The officials revealed that the previous evening, Assad had instructed his close adviser to draft a speech—which he never delivered—before departing from Damascus airport to Russia's Hmeimim air base, and later leaving the country.While Assad consistently called his opponents as ""terrorists"", Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the organisation responsible for his removal, has also been designated as a terrorist group by the United States and various Western governments.HTS, which originated from a former Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, separated from the jihadist organisation in 2016 and has attempted to present a more moderate image.Recently, both the US and British governments have initiated dialogue with the group.","Ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad said that he did not want to leave Syria and rather wanted to continue fighting the rebels.

Break in a long-standing alliance

Speculation on Freeland’s successor

Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday announced her resignation on Monday, citing fundamental disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the country's future economic direction.Freeland’s departure comes on the same day she was set to present a critical fall economic update , which analysts expected to reveal a significant increase in the budget deficit for 2023/24.“For the last number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds over the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland wrote in a resignation letter addressed to Trudeau and shared on X (formerly Twitter).She revealed that Trudeau had informed her last Friday that he no longer wanted her to continue as finance minister and had offered her an alternative cabinet role.“Upon reflection, I have concluded that the only honest and viable path is for me to resign from the Cabinet,” Freeland said.The Prime Minister's Office has yet to respond publicly to her resignation.Freeland, widely regarded as one of Trudeau’s closest allies and most powerful cabinet members, played a pivotal role in shaping Canada’s pandemic recovery strategy and negotiating trade agreements, including the renegotiation of NAFTA.Domestic media reports suggest that Freeland and Trudeau clashed over a proposed government package of temporary tax breaks and new spending measures. The disagreement reportedly came to a head in recent weeks as Canada faces rising inflation and public discontent over affordability issues.Freeland’s decision to step down marks a rare instance of open discord within Trudeau’s cabinet. “On Friday, you told me you no longer want me to serve as your Finance Minister,” she stated, underscoring the irreconcilable differences that led to her departure.Freeland’s resignation has sparked immediate speculation about her successor. Among the names being floated is former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who currently serves as an economic advisor to Trudeau.However, Carney is not a sitting legislator, and Canadian tradition would require him to seek a seat in the House of Commons before assuming a cabinet role.Freeland’s resignation comes at a critical juncture for Canada, as the country grapples with economic headwinds, including rising inflation, increased borrowing costs, and a ballooning deficit.The fall economic update she was scheduled to deliver on Monday was anticipated to outline measures to address these issues, but her departure casts uncertainty over the government’s fiscal strategy.","Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation on Monday, citing fundamental disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the country's future economic direction.

Trump Jr's public show of support

Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways, with sources claiming Guilfoyle’s fashion choices played a key role in their split. According to a Trump insider quoted by The Daily Beast, Trump Jr sought a new partner who could better win over his father, Donald Trump, and align with his expectations.Last week, Trump Jr was spotted holding hands with Palm Beach socialite and former model Bettina Anderson, signaling a new chapter in his love life. Reports by People indicate that Guilfoyle and Trump Jr's relationship had already been under strain for months, with Anderson entering the picture about six months ago. Sources suggest Trump Jr even took Anderson on a trip to Alaska while still in a relationship with Guilfoyle.A political insider revealed that Trump Jr had voiced dissatisfaction with Guilfoyle’s wardrobe, describing it as “too stiff” and “always professional.” Her signature look—brightly colored, form-fitting dresses paired with high heels — didn’t align with his vision. “Don Jr has been telling people for months that Kim is so uptight and never looks relaxed or casual. The tight dresses need to go, and she has been told that,” the source told People.Trump Jr's pursuit of Anderson reportedly stems from her ability to fit into the Waspy, high-society circles of Palm Beach—something that appeals to his desire to impress his father. “Someone like Bettina, who is and has been a model, is exactly the kind of person who would win over Donald Sr,” a source close to the Trump family told The Independent.Interestingly, Anderson reportedly pushed for Guilfoyle to be sent abroad as her relationship with Trump Jr grew. On Wednesday, Guilfoyle was named US Ambassador to Greece by Donald Trump. Sources said this decision was delayed until after the elections to avoid impacting Donald Trump Sr's campaign. “They waited for the election to pass but didn’t want the split to hurt Donald in any way,” a political source explained as reported by the People.Despite the swirling rumors, Trump Jr publicly praised Guilfoyle’s appointment on X (formerly Twitter), calling her “a fantastic America First leader.” The couple, who began dating in 2018 following Trump Jr's divorce from Vanessa Trump, has not commented on the split.As of now, Trump Jr appears focused on his future with Anderson, while Guilfoyle embraces her new role as ambassador. Whether the rift stemmed from fashion or other factors, one thing is certain—the Trump family drama never fails to captivate.","Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways.

"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz loses confidence vote, early election in February",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-loses-confidence-vote-early-election-in-february/articleshow/116375270.cms,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday, setting the stage for early elections on 23 February. The loss comes two months after the collapse of his three-party coalition government, leaving Scholz to lead a minority administration.In the 733-seat Bundestag , Scholz secured only 207 votes in his favour, with 394 voting against him and 116 abstaining, far short of the 367 votes needed for a majority. The vote was necessary under Germany ’s post-World War II constitution, which does not permit the self-dissolution of parliament.With the confidence vote lost, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will decide whether to dissolve parliament and call for elections. He has 21 days to make the decision but is expected to do so after Christmas to adhere to the planned February election date. Once dissolved, elections must be held within 60 days.Addressing lawmakers ahead of the vote, Scholz said, “The election will determine whether we, as a strong country, dare to invest strongly in our future; do we have confidence in ourselves and our country, or do we put our future on the line?” He also pitched his vision of modernising Germany’s debt rules and raising the minimum wage.Scholz's government fell apart on 6 November when he fired his finance minister amid a long-standing dispute over economic reforms. The minister’s pro-business party, the Free Democrats, subsequently exited the coalition, leaving Scholz and his remaining partners, the Greens, without a majority.Friedrich Merz , Scholz's centre-right challenger, criticised the chancellor's record, saying, “You’re leaving the country in one of its biggest economic crises in postwar history.” Merz also accused Scholz of prioritising debt over the competitiveness of Germany’s economy.The campaign for the February elections is already underway, with Scholz's Social Democrats trailing behind Merz’s opposition Union bloc in the polls. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens is also in contention, while the far-right Alternative for Germany has nominated Alice Weidel.In foreign policy, Scholz highlighted Germany’s strong military support for Ukraine but reiterated his opposition to sending long-range Taurus missiles, citing concerns about escalating the conflict with Russia. “We will do nothing that jeopardizes our own security,” he said.Confidence votes are rare in Germany, which values political stability. This marks only the sixth such vote in the country’s postwar history, with the last occurring in 2005 when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lost, leading to Angela Merkel's rise to power.","Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday, setting the stage for early elections on 23 February.

Devastation and community response

322 school shootings this year

The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, which happened just over twelve years after the deadly Sandy Hook shooting began with a chilling announcement over the intercom: “Lockdown. This is not a drill.” Sixth grader Breken Ives described the panic that followed as his teacher quickly moved students to safety, away from sightlines at the door, NYT reported.A 15-year-old female student, armed with a 9mm pistol, opened fire, killing a teacher and another student before turning the weapon on herself. Six others were injured, including two in critical condition, police confirmed.“This has obviously rocked our school community,” Barbara Wiers, the school’s director of elementary and school relations told AP. She noted that students had recently undergone lockdown drills in collaboration with the Madison Police Department. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown,’ and nothing else, they knew it was real.”Police Chief Shon Barnes declined to release the shooter’s identity or details about a possible motive. A search warrant was issued for her home, and her family is cooperating with investigators.Parents were reunited with their children at a nearby medical facility, some in tears as they embraced their loved ones. “As soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute,” said Bethany Highman, who rushed to find her daughter safe after receiving a FaceTime call.The shooting has left the school community grappling with grief just days before the Christmas break. Wiers said plans to resume classes would be decided later in the week, with an emphasis on supporting students and staff through community gatherings.President Joe Biden condemned the tragedy, calling for universal background checks and stricter gun laws. “We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart,” he said.This attack marks the 322nd school shooting in the United States this year, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. It is the second-highest total recorded since 1966, surpassed only by last year’s 349 incidents.Firearms remain the leading cause of death among children in the US, a stark reminder of the nation’s ongoing struggle to address gun violence. For the students of Abundant Life Christian School, the impact of this day will be felt for years to come.","A 15-year-old female student, armed with a 9mm pistol, opened fire, killing a teacher and another student before turning the weapon on herself.

I wouldn't have had him do that. I think it was a big mistake,"" he added.Asked if he would consider reversing the Biden administration decision, Trump responded: ""I might. I think it was a very stupid thing to do.""Meanwhile, the White House pushed back on Trump's criticism and said that the decision was made after months of deliberations that started before the US presidential elections.""All I can assure you is that in the conversations we've had with them since the election, and we've had at various levels, we have articulated to them the logic behind it, the thinking behind it, why we were doing it,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said.Trump reiterated his call on both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war, calling the death and despair caused by the conflict ""carnage.""""I think the Middle East will be in a good place,"" Trump said, referring to the conflict in Gaza and an unsettled Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. ""I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation.""Earlier this month, Zelenskyy met with Trump in Paris while the president-elect was visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have been making a forceful effort to get Trump to maintain support for Ukraine.But the situation on the ground in Ukraine continues to remain complicated as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly three-year war.The Pentagon last week unveiled US intelligence that predicts Russia could again launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine soon.",US President-elect Donald Trump says he may reverse Biden's decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to deepen into Russian territory.

"Hush money case: 'No immunity for unofficial acts,' Judge rejects Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss conviction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-no-immunity-for-unofficial-acts-judge-rejects-donald-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-conviction/articleshow/116383520.cms,"'This lawless case should be immediately dismissed,' Trump’s team reacts as immunity defense is denied

The hush money case

A New York judge ruled on Tuesday against a bid by US President-elect Donald Trump to have his hush money conviction thrown out, rejecting his argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity applied to the case.Judge Juan Merchan ruled that the immunity granted to presidents for official acts did not extend to the conduct involved in Trump’s conviction, which related to ""entirely unofficial conduct entitled to no immunity protections.""“Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury verdict... is denied,” Merchan stated, meaning that Trump’s conviction stands.Trump had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that his position as president-elect warranted the dismissal of the conviction. His lawyers also presented arguments based on a July Supreme Court decision that grants presidents immunity from prosecution for actions taken during their presidency. They claimed that certain evidence presented at trial, including Trump’s financial disclosure form, social media posts, and testimony from White House aides, should have been excluded. However, Judge Merchan disagreed, ruling that even if some of the evidence related to official acts, it did not affect the case, which focused on falsifying business records .Trump’s conviction stems from a $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, which prosecutors say was intended to cover up an alleged affair with Trump during the presidential campaign. The payments were aimed at protecting Trump’s election chances, prosecutors argued. Trump, however, has denied the affair and any wrongdoing.The ruling brings Trump closer to becoming the first president to enter the White House with a felony conviction, pending an appeal. His legal team has vowed to continue challenging the verdict, including raising issues of potential juror misconduct.As Trump faces the prospect of returning to office next month, the case is likely to continue as a source of legal and political controversy. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, slammed the case, saying, “This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed.”Prosecutors have argued that Trump’s bid to dismiss the case went too far, with their office stating, ""Multiple accommodations well short of dismissal... would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office.""The case continues to unfold as Trump navigates his legal challenges, with the potential for further legal battles as he prepares to take office once again.","Donald Trump's bid to have his hush money conviction thrown out was denied on Tuesday.

A grim pattern

Gun violence: A persistent crisis

A 17-year-old student opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School on Tuesday, killing a teacher and another student before taking her own life, police said. The tragic incident, which injured multiple people, occurred just days before the school’s scheduled Christmas break, leaving the community in shock and mourning.The shooting took place early morning at the private Christian school in Wisconsin’s capital city. Madison police chief Shon Barnes confirmed that responding officers did not fire their weapons and said the shooter’s death appeared to be a suicide.Investigators believe ""a female shooter"" used a 9mm pistol during the attack, according to an official who was quoted as saying by AP.Nine public schools in the area were temporarily placed on lockdown as a precaution after the shooting.The school had planned to break for the holidays on Friday, as noted on its website.President Joe Biden condemned the shooting in a statement, calling it “shocking and unconscionable” and renewing his call for stronger gun control measures.“From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings that don’t receive attention — it is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence,” Biden said. “Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom. Students across our country should be learning how to read and write — not having to learn how to duck and cover.”Abundant Life Christian School is a nondenominational institution founded in 1978, serving approximately 390 students from kindergarten through high school. The school emphasizes a Christ-focused academic environment and is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International.The school addressed the tragedy in a Facebook post: “Prayers Requested! Today, we had an active shooter incident at ALCS. We are in the midst of following up. We will share information as we are able. Please pray for our Challenger Family.”This shooting follows a disturbing trend of gun violence at schools in the United States. Just two weeks earlier, a gunman critically injured two kindergartners at Feather River School of Seventh-Day Adventists in Oroville, California, before taking his own life. The attacker, 56-year-old Glenn Litton, was reportedly mentally ill and claimed he was responding to America’s involvement in Middle East violence.In 2024 alone, there have been at least 202 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, leading to 56 deaths and 147 injuries, according to data from Everytown for Gun Safety. Last year, 45 people died in 158 school shootings, while 67 deaths were reported in 2022.The deadliest school shooting this year occurred in September at Apalachee High School in Georgia, where 14-year-old Colt Gray used a semiautomatic rifle to kill four people and injure nine. Both Colt and his father, Colin Gray, who allegedly provided access to the weapon, were indicted on murder and other charges.Firearms have been the leading cause of death among children in the US in recent years, according to research by KFF. While the nation continues to debate gun control, incidents like the one in Madison leave families grieving and communities questioning how to ensure their children’s safety.","A 17-year-old student opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School on Tuesday, killing a teacher and another student before taking her own life.

One of the theories is that Guilfoyle's personality and her dressing do not match the Trump family and she's not easygoing. Another reason is her drinking while Don Jr is sober for many years.

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.""There was a drone just hanging out,"" he told FOX 5 New York. ""I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.""He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down.

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Woman captured in viral video hurling the N-word on a Minnesota playground





Shiloh Hendrix, a white woman from Minnesota, who went viral after she was caught on camera using a racial slur sgainst a 5-year-old child at a park on 28 April, has received unexpected support—more than $790,000 in online donations.The money came through GiveSendGo, a platform known for hosting fundraisers linked to far-right causes. Her campaign drew over 30,000 supporters, many of whom left donation messages containing racial slurs and Nazi symbols.In her fundraiser description, Hendrix wrote: “My name is Shiloh and I have been put into a very dire situation. I recently had a kid steal from my 18-month-old son’s diaper bag at a park. I called the kid out for what he was. Another man, whom we recently found out has had a history with law enforcement, proceeded to record me and follow me to my car. He then posted these videos online, which have caused my family and me great turmoil… My eldest child may not be going back to school. Even where I exercise has been exposed.”In later posts, Hendrix thanked donors and said the fundraiser was life-changing. “We have a wonderful support team on our side… We can now work on starting a new life.Amazing things can happen when like-minded individuals work together. We have proven just how powerful and great we are,” she wrote.Hendrix case reflects a wider shift in the US since Donald Trump’s political rise. Such statements and the support that followed have alarmed critics. Between 2016 and 2022, extremist-linked campaigns on platforms like GiveSendGo raised more than $6 million, according to Anti-Defamation League.Mark Dwyer from the Anti-Defamation League said this kind of crowdfunding is no longer limited to organised far-right groups. It also attracts everyday people who may not see racism as a problem. “They don’t view what she did as wrong. For many, this might be the first action they take beyond posting on social media—donating money to show support,” The Guardian quoted Dwyer as saying.GiveSendGo has defended hosting the fundraiser, saying to The Guardian it supports “personal choice” even in controversial cases. “GiveSendGo is not a place of judgment but a place of generosity,” a spokesperson said.","Shiloh Hendrix, a white woman from Minnesota, who was caught on camera using a racial slur sgainst a 5-year-old child at a park on 28 April, has received unexpected support.

Vance’s ‘Jose’ Jibe BLOWS UP; Karen Bass Calls Out ‘Blatant Disrespect’

.





US vice president JD Vance was briefly suspended from the social media platform Bluesky on Wednesday evening—just minutes after making his first post. The platform is often seen as a liberal alternative to X, after Elon Musk bought the latter.Bluesky confirmed to Fox News that Vance’s official profile was mistakenly identified as a fake. “There have been many past attempts to impersonate Vice President JD Vance… and the jd-vance-1.bsky.social account was flagged as part of that pattern,” the company said. His account was restored within 20 minutes and now carries a verified badge.In his first post immediately after joining, Vance said: “Hello Bluesky, I've been told this app has become the place to go for common-sense political discussion and analysis. So I'm thrilled to be here to engage with all of you.”In the post, he also shared a screenshot of Justice Clarence Thomas’s opinion in a Supreme Court ruling that upheld Tennessee’s ban on sex-change surgeries for minors.He followed up with two more posts, saying Thomas’s opinion raised serious concerns about the medical treatment of transgender youth and criticised the role of pharmaceutical companies in promoting such treatments.“Many of those scientists are receiving substantial resources from big pharma to push these medicines on kids,” Vance wrote.The suspension quickly drew criticism from conservatives on X, who accused Bluesky of bias. “They banned him already,” posted commentator Eric Daugherty.Even Vance critics raised concerns. Journalist Billy Binion, who said he opposes Vance, called the move “unserious” and said it showed Bluesky’s unwillingness to engage with opposing views.Vance’s account remains active as of now.","US vice president JD Vance was briefly suspended from the social media platform Bluesky on Wednesday evening.

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era. But with Jeanie Buss still seated at the executive table and Mark Walter's proven record of success, Johnson’s enthusiastic approval signals confidence that the purple and gold’s proud tradition is in steady hands. As for Johnson's reaction, it was valid as the huge deal could change the very scenario of the franchise that already has several big names including LeBron James, Luka Doncic and more.",Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale.

The global disparity





More than 379,000 people in the United States became US dollar millionaires last year—an average of over 1,000 every day. This made America the country with the highest number of new millionaires, according to the latest Global Wealth Report by Swiss bank UBS. The country now holds nearly 40% of the world’s total millionaires.The increase in wealth was mainly driven by strong stock market performance and a stable US dollar. The S&P 500 index rose over 23% last year, boosting the value of investments and assets. Across the world, personal wealth grew by 4.6%, but the Americas saw an even bigger jump of more than 11%. That sharp rise made the region stand out compared to Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world.Despite the increase in millionaires, most people across the world have far less wealth. According to the report, over 80% of adults have a net worth of under $100,000. Only about 1.6% of the global adult population is worth $1 million or more.Greater China—which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan—had the highest number of people with net worths between $100,000 and $1 million. Western Europe and North America followed.The report also explains that “net worth” includes the value of all financial and real assets, such as property, minus any debts. In the Americas, the average wealth per adult by the end of 2024 was around $312,000—far lower than the millionaire mark, showing that large wealth gains remain limited to a small group.UBS expects personal wealth to keep rising in the coming years, led by continued growth in the US and parts of Asia. By 2029, the bank estimates that over 5 million more people around the world will join the ranks of millionaires.","More than 379,000 people in the United States became US dollar millionaires last year.

Travis Kelce shares cozy detail about nights in with Taylor Swift

Pin Up Jason, Donna Joins The Traitors and Fatherly ""Ed-Vice"" with Ed Kelce | EP 143

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce might be known for his bold plays on the field, but off the gridiron, his idea of a good time is surprisingly laid-back — especially when it comes to nights in with global pop icon Taylor Swift . During the latest episode of the New Heights podcast, Kelce offered fans a rare and candid glimpse into the couple's low-key life together, revealing a sweet detail: he and Swift keep a shared movie list.While discussing potential film picks for the podcast, Travis Kelce casually mentioned the iconic 1990 romantic comedy Pretty Woman. “I’m down to watch it,” he told brother Jason Kelce, before adding that the Julia Roberts–Richard Gere classic “has been on [his] and Tay’s movie list for a while.” The brief mention set off a ripple of fan curiosity, as listeners clung to the subtle insight into what the NFL champ and Grammy winner enjoy behind closed doors.Travis Kelce didn't divulge any other titles on the couple’s list, but it’s not the first time movies have played a part in their public love story. In December 2024, he reacted to Love Actually — a longtime favorite of Swift’s — with mixed feelings, calling it “far-fetched” but “fun.”His commentary added a touch of realism to a film that many associate with grand romantic gestures, a contrast that fans found both funny and relatable.In April, Kelce also recalled watching American Pie, the same movie name-dropped in Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department song “So High School,” widely believed to be about him. His memory of seeing it at a young age with “someone else’s parents” — since his own wouldn’t have approved — adds a nostalgic twist that pairs perfectly with the sentimental tone of Swift’s lyrics: “I’m watching ‘American Pie’ with you on a Saturday night. ”While Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce remain headline-makers, it’s the small, intimate details — like a shared movie list — that seem to capture fans' hearts. The couple continues to balance fame with normalcy, offering rare, honest glimpses into a relationship grounded in mutual respect, humor, and quiet connection. As Kelce simply put it, “I hope Travis is Travis,” — and clearly, when he’s with Taylor, that’s exactly who he gets to be.Also Read: “Taylor and Travis are disgusted”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce brutally cut off Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds after explosive legal threats Travis Kelce’s sweet reveal offers a rare glimpse into his quiet, personal moments with Taylor Swift, showing that even the biggest stars cherish simple, meaningful time together.","Travis Kelce gave rare insight into his and Taylor Swift's movie date night.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver

















The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.If the Chiefs successfully sign Brandon Aiyuk, it could mark a turning point for the franchise’s offense, providing Mahomes with the elite receiver he’s been missing. This potential acquisition has fans and analysts eagerly anticipating how it might transform Kansas City’s championship aspirations and redefine their strategy moving forward.If the Chiefs sign Aiyuk, expect a major boost in their passing game, with Mahomes gaining a reliable deep threat. This addition could push Kansas City back into Super Bowl contender status quickly. With Aiyuk’s talent and Mahomes’ leadership, the Chiefs could reestablish themselves as an offensive powerhouse.

What is the E-4B Nightwatch?

A link to ongoing conflict





One of America's so-called ""doomsday planes,"" the Boeing E-4B Nightwatch, made a rare flight to Joint Base Andrews near Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, as tensions continue to rise between Iran and Israel.The aircraft serves as a mobile command post in the event of a nuclear conflict or other national emergency.The plane left Bossier City, Louisiana, shortly before 6pm and landed just after 10pm, reports the New York Post. Flight data showed it took an unusual path along the coast and around the border of Virginia and North Carolina before touching down in Maryland.The plane was seen using the unfamiliar callsign ORDER01, instead of its typical ORDER6, sparking speculation online, with some suggesting it signalled a non-routine or priority mission. Flight watchers quickly noted the deviation.Although the E-4B Nightwatch makes routine flights throughout the year to ensure operational readiness, Tuesday's mission drew attention due to the timing. The aircraft took off just as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats against Tehran, demanding Iran's ""unconditional surrender"" in the face of increased Israeli airstrikes.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the demand on Wednesday, saying, ""This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition.""He warned that any US military intervention would cause ""irreparable damage.""Observers suggest the E-4B flight could be part of a broader effort to bolster presidential security and military preparedness amid fears of escalation in the Middle East.The E-4B is designed to function as an airborne command centre for the US President, Secretary of Defence and top military officials during a crisis. Its most famous operational use was on September 11, 2001, when it was deployed following the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.The aircraft is designed to endure a nuclear attack, with high-level protection against electromagnetic pulses, extreme heat, and cyber threats. It’s also capable of launching retaliatory missile strikes and comes fitted with 67 satellite dishes and antennas to ensure worldwide communication.The E-4B, famously known as the ""Flying Pentagon,"" can remain in the air for more than 35 hours and, thanks to its mid-air refuelling capability, can operate for up to a week without landing. The aircraft houses three decks that include briefing rooms, a command centre, advanced communication systems, 18 sleeping bunks, and designated rest areas.The flight came just hours before reports emerged that two Iranian government aircraft had left the country for Oman, fuelling rumours of emergency talks or senior leadership evacuations.Accompanying this were fresh warnings from Khamenei that Israel would be punished for its ""huge mistake"" in launching the bombing campaign that has killed at least 224 people in Iran.The real reason for Tuesday’s E-4B flight has not been confirmed, but its timing during rising global tensions has renewed public interest in one of America’s most secretive planes. As one of four in operation, the plane's role in national defence remains both symbolic and strategic.The US Air Force is currently working on a $13 billion programme to replace the ageing fleet, with Sierra Nevada Corporation developing the next generation of Nightwatch aircraft.","Boeing E-4B Nightwatch made rare flight to Joint Base Andrews near Washington, DC, on Tuesday night.

Hurricane Erick: Category 3 storm nears Mexico; southern states on high alert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-erick-category-3-storm-nears-mexico-southern-states-on-high-alert/articleshow/121942048.cms,"Hurricane Erick jumps to Category 3 storm

States on high alert

Communities prepare for flooding

'Strongest storm in Mexico'





Hurricane Erick has strengthened into a powerful Category 3 storm and is closing in on Mexico’s southern Pacific coast, the US National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday.The NHC has warned that the storm could bring “potentially destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods.”According to NHC, Erick had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and was moving northwest at a speed of 9 mph (15 km/h). The storm was located about 55 miles (90 kilometres) south-southwest of Puerto Ángel and roughly 160 miles (260 kilometres) southeast of Punta Maldonado.Forecasters said the hurricane is expected to strengthen before making landfall early Thursday, bringing dangerous storm surges, coastal flooding, and destructive waves to parts of the southern coast.The Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chiapas are on high alert, with the government urging residents to move to shelters and avoid risk zones. President Claudia Sheinbaum appealed to the public to stay indoors and follow official instructions.“We tell the population to stay tuned to official communications, to stay indoors, and not go out,” she said. “If you are in low-lying areas, near rivers, near waterways, it is best for you to go to shelters, to the shelters that have already been set up for this situation.”She also urged boat owners not to go out to sea.More than 2,000 temporary shelters have been established across the three states, and hundreds of troops, electricity workers, and civil protection teams have been deployed. Local authorities suspended classes, closed ports, and heightened alerts in cities and tourist destinations along the coast, including Acapulco.Authorities are particularly concerned about the risk of flash floods and mudslides in mountainous regions. Torrential rains are forecast in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas, with up to 16 inches (40 centimetres) of rainfall expected in some areas.Laura Velázquez, Mexico’s national civil defence coordinator, said rivers and dams are being monitored closely. “Torrential” rain is expected, with risks heightened in regions with steep terrain.Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado confirmed that all schools were closed and 582 shelters had been prepared. The port of Acapulco was shut Tuesday evening, and fishing and tourism operators were advised to secure their equipment.Erick is the fifth named storm of the Pacific hurricane season, which runs through November. Authorities continue to urge residents in the storm’s path to take precautions seriously and stay informed.Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Hurricane Erick rapidly intensified as it moved through ideal conditions off Mexico’s southern coast. Scientists say this rapid intensification — defined as a storm gaining at least 35 mph in 24 hours — has become more frequent in a warmer climate. Erick surged by 50 mph in just 18 hours, and forecasters expect it to strengthen further. “It’s likely that when Erick hits, it will be the strongest storm to make landfall in that part of Mexico this early in the season,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.Experts note that while Erick is powerful, it differs from the deadly Hurricane Otis, which struck Acapulco in October 2023 after forming over deeper, warmer waters. The current storm’s environment is slightly cooler below the surface, though surface temperatures remain high. “It’s got a good stormy eye forming,” said atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero, adding the storm’s surroundings are “extremely moist,” which fuels its growth.","Erick has maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and is closing in on Mexico's southern Pacific coast.

Israel-Iran war: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-donald-trump-may-consider-joining-israel-in-striking-nuclear-sites-report-claims-growing-us-involvement/articleshow/121918496.cms,"



US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.

US Fed Meeting: Top Highlights & Takeaways

Recent economic indicators point towards sustained robust growth in economic activity, despite fluctuations in net exports affecting the data, the policy statement said.

US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

US Fed has forecasted higher inflation and lower US GDP growth. Officials at the Federal Reserve anticipate that inflation, based on their preferred measurement, will increase to 3% towards the end of this year, compared to 2.1% recorded in April.

Their projections indicate the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5%, up from the present rate of 4.2%.

The US GDP growth is expected to come down to 1.4% this year, showing a significant reduction from the previous year's 2.5%.

Labour market stability persists with low unemployment rates and steady employment conditions. Price levels continue to show moderate elevation, it said.

Whilst economic uncertainty has decreased, it still remains elevated. The Committee maintains vigilance regarding risks to both aspects of its dual mandate.

The Committee continues to evaluate incoming data's implications for economic prospects whilst determining suitable monetary policy stance. Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the Committee's objectives, they stand ready to modify monetary policy accordingly. The evaluations encompass diverse factors, including labour market status, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic trends, the statement added.

US Fed Chair Defies Donald Trump

US Fed Meeting: The US Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, kept interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, defying President Donald Trump ’s call for a rate cut.“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the US Federal Reserve statement reads.The US central bank has maintained its key interest rate steady in the current year, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent. Market observers had widely anticipated that Fed officials will maintain their current position until inflation shows consistent signs of moderation.During the Federal Reserve's second day of meetings, Trump intensified his demands for interest rate cuts, directing criticism at Federal Reserve Chairman Powell whilst dismissing inflation concerns.""We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed, he probably won't cut today,"" Trump remarked about Powell, making these comments just hours before the Federal Reserve's scheduled announcement.""We have no inflation, we have only success, and I'd like to see interest rates get down,"" he continued whilst speaking at the White House. ""Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself?""Inflation has shown a downward trend since January, and economic experts indicate that without elevated import duties, the Federal Reserve would be implementing further rate reductions.The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Powell regarding borrowing costs, with Trump directly referring to the Fed chair as a ""numbskull"" for not implementing cuts. Additional administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have joined in advocating for rate reductions.Economists express concern when there is pressure on the Fed to reduce rates solely to decrease government interest payments, as this could compromise the Fed's congressional responsibility to maintain price stability and maximum employment.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction that the Fed maintains rates whilst other global central banks have decreased their borrowing costs, including those in Europe, Canada, and the UK. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan maintained its short-term rate at 0.5%, following a recent increase.The European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have implemented rate reductions this year partly due to US tariffs affecting their economies. Meanwhile, the US economy remains predominantly robust, with low unemployment levels.","US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

'Cried for an hour after funeral': Raj Kushwaha's family claims he's innocent in Meghalaya murder case

(With inputs from PTI)





INDORE: The grandmother of accused Raj Kushwaha has died in Uttar Pradesh's Fatehpur district following a heart attack.According to family members, Ramlali had gone into deep shock ever since Raj was arrested for the murder of Indore's Raja Raghuvanshi in Meghalaya.Family sources say she had stopped eating and remained withdrawn for days. Late Tuesday night, she suffered a heart attack and died.Ram Lalli, 74, died at her residence in Rampur village of Gazipur, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district. Her husband, Darbari Singh, told reporters that she had been deeply distressed since Raj’s name emerged as the key conspirator in the case.""She was constantly defending her grandson, insisting he was innocent and being framed,"" Singh said, adding that the allegations weighed heavily on her.Just a week ago, Ram Lalli had spoken to the media in support of her grandson. ""Raj never had an affair with anyone. Sonam got her husband killed and is dragging Raj into this,"" she had said. She had also alleged that powerful people were involved in the case and “they can do anything.”Singh recalled Raj as a quiet, responsible young man who had been supporting his family ever since his father died during the Covid pandemic.The family had moved to Indore around 15 years ago amid financial hardship, with Raj joining them about a decade later along with his mother and two sisters, once their situation stabilised.Raj, a Class 12 pass-out, worked as an accountant at a furniture sheet manufacturing unit owned by Sonam Raghuvanshi’s family in Indore's Govind Nagar Kharcha area.Police have so far refused to comment on the development, citing that the case is being handled by authorities in another state.Raja Raghuvanshi had married Sonam on May 11 and the couple left for their honeymoon in Meghalaya on May 20. Just three days later, Raja went missing. His mutilated body was found on June 2 in a gorge near a waterfall in Sohra, East Khasi Hills.Sonam surrendered to police in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district on June 8. Raj Kushwaha and others accused were picked up from various parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.According to investigators, Sonam allegedly orchestrated her husband’s murder, with Raj and three of his childhood friends helping to execute the plan.""No, not our boy..."" — the words echo through a cramped 200sqft room in Indore’s Shankar Nagar, where the family of 21-year-old Raj Kushwaha has shut themselves away in disbelief. Raj was arrested for allegedly conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi to murder her husband Raja during their honeymoon in Meghalaya.Since the arrest, the family has been in a state of shock. Raj’s 15-year-old sister reportedly faints every time a police siren passes by. Neighbours have stopped speaking to them. The family is reeling from the accusation that Raj, who worked in billing for Sonam's family business, was not only her lover but also allegedly orchestrated Raja’s murder with the help of three childhood friends.Police said Raj stayed close to both families in the aftermath of the incident, even attending Raja’s funeral and supporting Sonam’s father. ""He cried for an hour after coming from the funeral,"" said his mother, 52-year-old Chunni Bai. ""He said he'd have died if he had seen Raja's body.""But things changed quickly. Hours after the cremation last Sunday, Raj changed clothes and left, telling his family he was going to co-accused Vishal’s house. Then came silence — his phone was switched off. He was later picked up by police from Vishal’s home.","Ram Lalli, 74, died at her residence in Rampur village of Gazipur, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district.

His resume includes:- 2019-20 NBA All-Defensive First Team- 2021-22 Defensive Player of the Year- Key contributor to Boston’s 2022 Finals runThe Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, ranking 18th in defensive rating.Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.Marcus Smart's interest from the Los Angeles Lakers suggests a practical approach to roster construction. He won't fix every issue they have, but his playoff experience and defensive prowess make him a prime target. Los Angeles' pursuit of another championship may benefit from this move if they can outmaneuver Sacramento.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL GOAT took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Gisele Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Tom Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Tom Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching. She may not like to show what's there after starting a complete new life!Also Read: Tom Brady once choked up as he admitted he wasn’t as good a father as his own dad: ""When I think about being a dad...""","Gisele Bündchen did not post on her social media for Father's Day.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s wife, Mariah Riddlesprigger does not want her husband to fall for streaming



Money has a loud noise, and everyone seems to fall for it, even Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . In a recent clip, having a chat with his wife Mariah Riddlesprigger, Antetokounmpo shared that he wants to stream and make loads of money. However, the idea was straightaway declined by his wife, who reminded him of existing responsibilities on his hands.Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo may be one of the NBA ’s most dominant forces on the court, but off the hardwood, he’s considering an entirely different arena, live streaming. In a playful interaction with his wife, Mariah Riddlesprigger, Giannis opened up about his desire to step into the world of online content creation, sparking interest across social media and the streaming community.During a now-viral TikTok Live, Giannis turned to his fans and asked, “Should I start streaming? IShowSpeed, Kai Cenat, help a brother out!” The questioncertainly showed his genuine curiosity about diving into the booming world of streaming.Giannis praised both Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed, calling them engaging and excellent at what they do. “I’ve seen them how they’re doing it, they’re actually good at it. Engaging, they’re very good!” he said.The two popular streamers, who have built massive audiences on Twitch and YouTube, were name-dropped repeatedly as Giannis contemplated following their lead. His interest appears to be more than a passing thought, it’s part of a larger trend of elite athletes exploring ways to connect with fans beyond traditional sports media.However, not everyone in the Antetokounmpo household was sold on the idea. His wife, Mariah, quickly offered a practical perspective. When Giannis asked why he shouldn’t pursue streaming, she immediately rejected the idea, “Because we have four kids and a lot of other responsibilities.” The couple's humorous back-and-forth continued, as Giannis tried to justify the venture by pointing out the financial upside. “Do you know how much money they make? They make a lot of money, baby.”Even though he already has a lucrative NBA contract— with $54 million set for the upcoming season and nearly $300 million earned in his career— Giannis seems intrigued by the challenge and creativity of streaming. He recently returned from a vacation in Brazil and appeared refreshed and reflective, perhaps setting the stage for new endeavors during what he called “the greatest offseason of all time.”“Basically, I’m having my own podcast without doing nothing,” Giannis joked. “People are out here asking me questions.” His wife quipped in response, “Which is what streamers do, right?”Also Read: Who is Mark Walter?

But as of now, Antetokounmpo is having the moment of his offseason break with his family.","Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is considering streaming.

Who is Mark Walter? A quiet powerhouse behind major sports teams



Mark Walter is a billionaire with a diverse portfolio



Mark Walter is also a philanthropist



The Los Angeles Lakers have entered a new era. After more than four decades under the stewardship of the Buss family, majority ownership of one of the NBA’s most iconic franchises is being handed to billionaire businessman Mark Walter. The landmark deal, reportedly worth $10 billion, is now the largest sale of a U.S. sports franchise ever. While Jeanie Buss will remain governor and the family will retain a minority stake, the control of the franchise shifts to a name many fans are now eager to learn more about. Now, here’s what you need to know about the Lakers' new owner, Mark Walter.Mark Walter is one of the most influential owners of several sports franchises, though he rarely seeks the spotlight. The 65-year-old CEO of TWG Global and founder of Guggenheim Capital has long been active in professional sports. He already owned 26% of the Lakers before the sale and, through a right of first refusal obtained in 2021 when he bought Phil Anschutz's stake, was in a prime position to secure the franchise when the Buss family decided to sell.This transition was anticipated by many. His purchase brings stability backed by a proven track record, most notably with the Los Angeles Dodgers.Under Walter’s leadership, the Dodgers have been a model of consistency and success. Since Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the team in 2012 for a then-record $2.15 billion, the Dodgers have made the playoffs every year, winning the World Series in 2020 and again in 2024. Superstar additions like Shohei Ohtani have only added to his winning blueprint.Walter’s reach goes far beyond Los Angeles. He holds ownership stakes in Chelsea FC and RC Strasbourg through BlueCo, and in motorsports via Cadillac F1, Andretti Global (IndyCar), and Wayne Taylor Racing. He also owns a sixth of the Los Angeles Sparks and established the Professional Women’s Hockey League, whose championship trophy is named the Walter Cup.Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Walter pursued his education in the Midwest, earning a business degree from Creighton University and a law degree from Northwestern. His wealth was built through a series of financial ventures, culminating in Guggenheim Partners, which manages over $340 billion in assets.Forbes currently estimates his net worth at $6.1 billion, though Bloomberg places it significantly higher at $12.5 billion.Walter has left a sizable imprint on the community, donating $50 million to the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation and another $5.5 million to the Women’s Sports Foundation.Also Read: Also Read: Magic Johnson shared his honest thoughts on Jeanie Buss selling Los Angeles Lakers for a whopping $10 billion: “Largest sports franchise sale in history”","Mark Walter is the new owner of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Poll Have you ever experienced any symptoms related to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)? Yes, frequently No, never





Sleep disturbances and insomnia

Signs that all is not well with your liver

Abdominal discomfort intensifying at night



Loss of appetite during evening meals



Other symptoms of fatty liver that you must be careful:

Unexplained weight loss

NB: This information is based on internet research and is intended for general knowledge only. It should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

The liver is the largest internal organ in your body. It plays a key role in digesting food, storing energy, and eliminating toxins.Liver health implies the overall well-being and proper functioning of the liver, a vital organ responsible for over 500 essential functions in the body. These functions include filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile for digestion, storing glucose, and metabolizing nutrients. Maintaining liver health is crucial for overall well-being, as a healthy liver ensures efficient detoxification, nutrient processing, and other vital processes.Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver. There are two primary types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease, also known as alcoholic steatohepatitis.Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population. Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).Often termed the ""silent epidemic,"" NAFLD can progress to more severe conditions like cirrhosis soon, if left unchecked. While many symptoms manifest during the day, certain warning signs become more pronounced at night.Recognizing these nocturnal symptoms is crucial for early detection and management.Individuals with fatty liver disease often report difficulty falling or staying asleep . The discomfort from liver inflammation or the body's struggle to process toxins can lead to restless nights. Moreover, the liver's reduced ability to store and release glycogen can cause blood sugar imbalances, further disrupting sleep patterns.A common symptom of fatty liver disease is discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This sensation can worsen at night, making it hard to get a good night's sleep. People may feel a sense of fullness or pressure, which can be quite concerning.Though not typically a symptom seen during night time, a decrease in appetite, particularly at night, may signify fatty liver disease. Individuals may find they have less interest in food, especially during dinner, which could eventually lead to weight loss and nutritional problems.As fatty liver disease progresses, the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream can affect brain function. This may lead to symptoms like confusion, poor memory, or trouble focusing on any task, commonly referred to as ""brain fog.""Fatigue is a hallmark of fatty liver disease. However, when the liver's detoxification processes are compromised, individuals may experience overwhelming tiredness during the night. This isn't just typical tiredness; it's an overpowering fatigue that can interfere with daily life.While swelling can occur at any time, it may become more noticeable at night. Fluid retention due to liver dysfunction can lead to swelling in the legs and feet, causing discomfort and affecting sleep quality.Fatty liver disease can cause itchy skin, especially if liver damage affects bile flow. When bile salts build up under the skin, it can cause irritation and itching, even if there is no visible rash.Unexplained weight loss can be an early indicator of fatty liver disease. The liver's involvement in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of body weight, can be disrupted, leading to unintended weight loss.In more advanced stages of fatty liver disease, jaundice can develop. This condition causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow due to elevated levels of bilirubin, a waste product from red blood cells. Yellowing of the skin is a red flag. Jaundice is a serious sign and should be checked by a doctor immediately.While adopting a healthy lifestyle – which consists of a balanced diet, regular exercise, checking alcohol consumption and smoking, and having adequate sleep – can significantly elevate liver health, if you experience any of the above symptoms, especially during the night, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Early detection through blood tests and imaging can help manage and potentially reverse the effects of fatty liver disease. Consult a doctor if you see such symptoms. Don't wait for the symptoms to worsen. It is important that you ensure a healthy well-being of your liver as it becomes one of the most vital organs of survival as the age increases, but also loses immunity without proper care.","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver.

A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection, and now doctors are warning others to be aware of the symptoms.William Hand, a recent 8th-grade graduate from Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, started feeling really unwell early on June 8. He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, ""Everything snowballed and God called him home."" He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with ""flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire,"" saying, ""I will see you again, son. ""Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat, and is usually fatal.Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference. It’s one of those “better safe than sorry” situations where awareness really can save lives. So do not dismiss the signs, and seek immediate medical attention.","A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection.

Why Arjun Was Chosen: The Untold Secret of Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3

Every year, thousands of devotees from across Maharashtra in India and beyond embark on a spiritual journey which is unlike any other. Called the Pandharpur Wari, it is a centuries-old pilgrimage in honour of Lord Vitthal, who is a revered form of Lord Vishnu. This deeply spiritual tradition is not just a walk— it is an emotion for many devotees with a deep cultural and devotional meaning.The Wari begins from the towns of Dehu and Alandi, that are homes of two legendary saints— Sant Tukaram Maharaj and Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj, respectively. The pilgrimage culminates in the sacred town of Pandharpur, on the auspicious day of Ashadhi Ekadashi; which falls on July 6 this year.Pandharpur Wari is a grand procession of faith, where Warkaris (i.e. devotees) walk for nearly 20 days, covering over 250 kilometres on foot. Along the way, they sing abhangas (devotional songs), perform kirtans, and immerse themselves in spiritual reflection.Two prominent Palkhi (palanquin) processions lead the way:- Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi from Dehu- and Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi from AlandiEach procession carries the padukas (or sacred sandals) of the saints, symbolising their eternal spiritual presence.The Palkhi leaves from Dehu on June 18, 2025, and arrives in Pandharpur on July 5, a day before Ashadhi Ekadashi.June 18: Departure from Dehu – ceremonial send-offJune 20: PuneJune 27: AklujJuly 1–4: Final stretch begins, rest and spiritual preparationJuly 5: Grand entry into PandharpurJuly 6: Ashadhi Ekadashi – the much-awaited darshan of Lord Vitthal and Goddess RukminiAlong the way, towns offer community meals, medical camps, devotional programs, and more— showcasing a beautiful blend of tradition and hospitality.Sant Tukaram’s teachings centered on bhakti (devotion), equality, and love for all beings. His abhangas (teachings) still echo across Maharashtra, inspiring people to live a life of humility and devotion, free from caste or social divisions.1. Bhakti (Devotion) is the highest pathSant Tukaram emphasized that pure devotion to Lord Vitthal is the most meaningful way to attain spiritual fulfillment. He believed that heartfelt love and surrender to God are more important than rituals or caste.2. Equality and social justiceHe rejected caste-based discrimination and upheld the idea that all beings are equal in the eyes of God. He welcomed people from all walks of life to join in devotional singing (kirtans).3. Simplicity in lifeTukaram Maharaj led a simple life and preached detachment from material possessions. He encouraged people to be content with what they have and live humbly with gratitude.4. Power of kirtan and abhangasHe spread spiritual knowledge through abhangas (devotional verses) and kirtans, making complex philosophies accessible to common people in their own language, fostering collective devotion and unity.5. Surrender to God’s willTukaram Maharaj taught that everything happens by God’s will. Instead of resisting life’s challenges, one should surrender and trust that the divine has a higher plan.This Palkhi departs from Alandi on June 19, 2025, reaching Pandharpur on July 5, alongside Tukaram Maharaj’s procession.June 20: Pune – vibrant devotional celebrationsJune 24: JejuriJune 30: NateputeJuly 4: Wakhari – final halt before reaching PandharpurSant Dnyaneshwar, a 13th-century saint and philosopher, is known for his ‘Dnyaneshwari’, a Marathi commentary on the sacred Hindu text- the Bhagavad Gita. His legacy celebrates spiritual knowledge, self-realisation, and oneness with the divine. Walking with his padukas symbolises a seeker’s journey toward wisdom and inner peace.More than a religious event, Pandharpur Wari is a living embodiment of unity, devotion, and cultural pride. Rich and poor, young and old, men and women— all walk together, chanting ""Vitthal Vitthal!"" with unmatched energy. There’s no distinction—only shared devotion, simplicity, and service.In an increasingly fast-paced world, Wari offers a chance to slow down, reflect, and reconnect— with faith, community, and oneself. Whether you walk a mile or watch from the sidelines, the spirit of Wari touches every heart it encounters.","Pandharpur Wari is a centuries-old pilgrimage in honour of Lord Vitthal, who is a revered form of Lord Vishnu.

Unhealthy Gut Symptoms: Six warning signs of an unhealthy gut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/unhealthy-gut-symptoms-six-warning-signs-of-an-unhealthy-gut/articleshow/121898410.cms,"Frequent bloating , burping, and acidity

Skin issues : Acne, breakouts, and dullness



Irregular pooping schedule: Constipation and diarrhea



Hair fall, thin hair, and weak nails



Hormonal imbalance : No appetite at all or constant hunger



Constant fatigue or sleep disorders



Signs of an unhealthy gut by Dr. Ishi Khosla

NB: This information is based on internet research and is intended for general knowledge only. It should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

Our gut is a natural indicator that something is wrong with our body. It examines the body from the inside and monitors hormone imbalance, nutrient deficiencies, and overall well-being. It doesn't just affect our stomach but also impacts our skin, hormones, and mood. Sometimes there are silent signals that we often ignore, assuming them to be something else, but that might just be our gut telling us to eat better and work better. ( Let us look at six of these signs...If your stomach starts to feel uncomfortably full after each meal or you find yourself burping constantly, it could be more than just a heavy meal and eating too fast. These symptoms often reflect the early signs of gut imbalance or a slow metabolic system. If your gut is healthy, it will efficiently process food, minimizing these discomforts. Symptoms like gas, bloating, constipation, and heartburn are distress signals from your gut.If something is not right with your body, it will show up on your face, reflecting what is going on the inside. Persistent pimples, dull skin texture, and sudden breakouts might not just be a skincare issue; it could be your gut’s way of asking for help.Imbalances in the gut may contribute to conditions such as deteriorating skin quality and psoriasis, which can affect the immune system.The most obvious red flag is the irregular bowel movement. If you are struggling with constipation, unpredictable timings, and frequent diarrhea, it is a sign, your digestive system needs support. Constipation may occur when the gut lacks the right balance of fibre, hydration, or healthy bacteria. If you are having loose stools, it may signal inflammation in your body, infection, and even food intolerances.If you notice significant changes in your hair and nails, then take it as a sign of an unhealthy gut. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, the body may struggle to absorb essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins like zinc, iron, etc. Addressing gut health can therefore, be a crucial step in restoring fuller hair, healthier nails, and overall vitality.Your appetite has much to do with what goes inside your body. It is a finely tuned system that involves multiple hormones like ghrelin (hunger hormone), leptin (which signals fullness), and cortisol. These hormones rely heavily on signals from the gut. If your gut is inflamed and overloaded with harmful bacteria, it can throw the body’s natural balance off. The body might feel starved for nutrients and push levels of unnaturally high hunger. Ignoring such fluctuations may lead to long-term hormonal disorders, mood instability, or chronic digestive issues.Your gut health resonates with your sleep quality. Having an unhealthy gut can impact your sleep habits, leading to chronic fatigue and fragmented sleep. The intricate links between energy levels, metabolic function, and gut health necessitate restoring equilibrium for restful sleep.Donot dismiss these symptoms. So the next time your body starts to experience any of these symptoms, be sure to check with your trusted doctor to inquire further about the underlying condition.","If your stomach starts to feel uncomfortably full after each meal or you find yourself burping constantly, it could be more than just a heavy meal and eating too fast.

5 dementia symptoms hiding in plain sight that are not just normal aging,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-dementia-symptoms-hiding-in-plain-sight-that-are-not-just-normal-aging/articleshow/121858845.cms,"What is dementia?



Frequent word-finding difficulties



Misplacing items in unusual places



Withdrawal from social activities



Changes in financial management



Mood and personality changes



Depression, anxiety linked to earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease

As we age, certain cognitive changes are expected, such as occasional forgetfulness or slower processing speeds. However, some symptoms may appear subtle and are often mistaken for normal aging, when in fact, they could indicate early stages of dementia.Dementia is a common and disabling disease that affects the brain. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050. There are currently over 55 million people with dementia worldwide, and nearly 10 million new cases of dementia develop each year.Now, dementia is a broad term describing a decline in cognitive abilities that encompasses various causes, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, among others.Although there’s no proper cure for dementia, prevention is possible even from a young age. It’s the spotting of early signs of the disease that helps in preventing the disease with an early diagnosis and treatment. Recognizing these signs early can lead to better management and planning.It's common to occasionally forget a word or name, especially if it's not frequently used. However, individuals with early dementia may experience persistent challenges in finding the right words during conversations.They might pause mid-sentence, use fillers like ""that thing,"" or substitute words incorrectly, such as calling a ""watch"" a ""hand-clock."" These difficulties can disrupt communication and may go unnoticed in casual interactions.While misplacing items occasionally is a normal part of aging, individuals with dementia may place items in unusual locations and be unable to retrace their steps to find them. For instance, placing a wallet in the refrigerator or a remote control in a drawer is more than just absent-mindedness. This behavior can lead to confusion and may cause the individual to accuse others of stealing.A person who once enjoyed social gatherings may begin to withdraw from them, not due to a lack of interest but because they feel overwhelmed or embarrassed by their cognitive difficulties. They might avoid phone calls, skip family dinners, or stop participating in hobbies they once loved. This withdrawal is often a coping mechanism to hide memory lapses or confusion.Dementia can affect judgment and decision-making abilities. Individuals may begin to make poor financial decisions, such as forgetting to pay bills, making unusual purchases, or falling victim to scams. These changes in financial behavior can be early indicators of cognitive decline and should be addressed promptly.Subtle shifts in mood and personality can be early signs of dementia. An individual may become unusually anxious, fearful, suspicious, or depressed. They might also exhibit irritability or anger over minor issues. These changes can be mistaken for normal aging or stress, but if they persist, they may indicate underlying cognitive issues.While some cognitive changes are a normal part of aging, it's important to be aware of signs that may indicate early dementia. If you or a loved one is experiencing persistent difficulties with language, memory, social interactions, financial management, or mood, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. Early diagnosis can lead to better management and improved quality of life.","Dementia is a common and disabling disease that affects the brain.

Unexplained nipple changes

Swelling or lumps in underarms

Chronic Fatigue

Persistent breast or nipple pain

Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult a medical professional if you notice any changes in your body

Breast cancer is a condition where malignant (cancer) cells form in the breast tissues. It is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, and rarely occurs in men. If detected early, breast cancer is fully treatable, and most breast cancer survivors go on to live healthy, full lives. Like it is with all cancers, the symptoms may be mild at first, and usually unnoticeable, but it is important to keep a check, especially if someone in your blood line has had breast cancer (sibling, mother, maternal aunt etc). Here are 5 early symptoms of breast cancer that should not be overlooked...One of the subtle signs of breast cancer is a change in the skin texture on the breast, which can look like dimpling or puckering. This is sometimes described as resembling the skin of an orange. These changes happen when cancer cells block lymph vessels under the skin, causing swelling and thickening. The skin may look tight, rough, or have small dents. Because these changes can be mistaken for skin conditions like eczema, they are often overlooked.Nipple changes are another early symptom that many women miss. These changes include sudden nipple inversion (where the nipple pulls inward instead of pointing outward), nipple retraction, or unusual nipple discharge.The discharge may be clear, bloody, or appear without squeezing and usually happens in only one breast. While some nipple changes can be harmless, sudden changes or persistent nipple discharge should never be ignored, as they can indicate breast cancer.Breast cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes before a lump is noticeable in the breast itself. Swelling or lumps under the arm or near the collarbone may be one of the first signs of this spread. These lumps may feel firm, tender, or irregular in shape. Because they are outside the breast, they can be easily overlooked or mistaken for swollen lymph nodes due to infection.Fatigue is a common symptom in daily life, and is usually overlooked. However, persistent, chronic fatigue (and not the daily tiredness) that does not improve with rest, can be an early sign of breast cancer. This happens because the body uses a lot of energy fighting cancer and dealing with inflammation. If fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms like weight loss or loss of appetite, it is important to seek medical advice promptly.Many women experience breast pain related to their menstrual cycle or minor injuries, so they often dismiss breast pain as normal. However, persistent, localized pain in one area of the breast or nipple that does not go away and is not linked to hormonal changes needs to be checked out. This pain may feel sharp, burning, or throbbing and should not be ignored, especially if it is new or different from usual breast discomfort. Persistent pain can sometimes indicate inflammation or a growing tumor that needs medical attention. However, it needs to be noted that pain is not the primary sign of breast cancer, and is usually not related to early stage cancer.","Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide.

Advantages

No need for monthly top-ups

Who should consider this pass?

How to get the annual pass?

India’s FASTag, toll collection system, is all set for a major upgrade. Starting August 15, 2025, the Indian government will roll out a new FASTag Annual Pass for private vehicles. The new initiative was announced by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. And the main aim of this pass is to make highway travel more affordable, simple and faster for millions of travellers who use highways across the nation.The new pass system will allow owners of private cars, jeeps, and vans to pay a one-time fee of INR 3,000 for an annual pass. With this, travellers can take 200 trips across any national highway toll plazas across India. Whichever comes first will be considered. Once you hit the approved number, your regular FASTag charges will resume.The minister took to X and shared the scheme:There are several advantages of the annual pass but one of the biggest benefits is that it is cost effective. Understand this with this example: If you are a regular traveller, who pays ₹340 for monthly toll pass that too for just one toll plaza. In 12 months, you’ll end up paying ₹4,080 but if you are opting for a yearly pass, you’ll just pay ₹3,000 which covers travel across the entire national highway network. So you are surely saving big!The new system also removes the need for monthly top-ups or buying separate passes for different plazas.Everything is prepaid and managed through your existing FASTag. It will be updated and monitored using the Rajmarg Yatra app or official NHAI portals.The pass is a perfect choice for private vehicle owners who frequently travel on highways. It is also beneficial for daily commuters, road-trippers, and long-distance travellers. The pass is also ideal for those who drive often between towns or cities for work or family visits.The annual pass system will be functional from Independence Day 2025 (15th August). From this day, users can buy and activate the pass online without any paperwork.With the new FASTag Annual Pass system, the government is hoping to reduce travel time and be pocket friendly.","Starting August 15, 2025, the Indian government will roll out a new FASTag Annual Pass for private vehicles.

Keeping your liver healthy is crucial for overall well-being. Let’s not forget that there literally is a ‘live’ in liver! The liver performs over 500 essential functions, including detoxification, nutrient processing, and bile production for digestion. Liver disease affects millions of people across the globe, and it is on the rise, more than ever. When liver disease develops, its early symptoms are often subtle and are mistaken for minor ailments or ignored entirely. This can delay diagnosis of conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Early diagnosis can be life-saving. Here are seven early symptoms of liver disease that you should not ignore, and get medical help immediately.Feeling tired all the time is never a good sign for anyone. Chronic fatigue is one of the earliest and most common signs of liver dysfunction. (though it can signify other things too) The liver is responsible for converting nutrients into energy, and when it’s impaired, energy production gets disrupted. And as a result, one would often feel drained despite adequate sleep. Many dismiss it as stress or overwork, but persistent fatigue warrants a doctor’s visit.Abdominal pain is one of the earliest signs of liver disease. Any discomfort or bloating in the upper right abdomen, where the liver resides, may signal inflammation or an enlarged liver. In some cases, ascites, a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, can cause noticeable swelling. People tend to mistake this for indigestion, gas, or overeating.Yellowing of the skin and eyes is a crucial sign of jaundice. A subtle yellow tint in the skin or whites of the eyes signals jaundice, which is caused by a buildup of bilirubin when the liver can’t process it effectively. Mild jaundice is often mistaken for a tan or poor lighting. Even slight yellowing, especially if accompanied by other symptoms, requires immediate medical evaluation to assess liver function and prevent further damage.Unexplained persistent itching, particularly on the hands, feet, or entire body, can indicate liver issues . This is because when the liver fails to clear bile salts, they accumulate under the skin and cause irritation. People often think this itching is related to allergies, eczema, or dry skin. If over-the-counter remedies don’t relieve the itch, it hints at an underlying liver problem that requires a thorough investigation.Changes in urine also hinted at impaired liver function. Urine that appears dark, amber, or brown, even with adequate hydration, can indicate excess bilirubin being excreted through the kidneys. People assume it’s just dehydration. If you experience this symptom, along with other signs like jaundice, seek immediate medical attention.Sudden, unintentional weight loss can occur when the liver struggles to metabolize nutrients. This may lead to reduced appetite or disrupted digestion. While some may see weight loss as a positive change, if it’s unexplained and rapid, it’s alarming.Pale color stool is a crucial sign of liver damage. Clay-colored, or grayish stools, can result from reduced bile production or blocked bile ducts, both tied to liver function. Unusually dark or tarry stools may indicate internal bleeding or liver-related issues.","The liver's vital role in detoxification and digestion is often overlooked.

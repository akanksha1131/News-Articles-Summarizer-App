Who is Benjamin Hanil Song?





Federal authorities are searching for Benjamin Hanil Song who is accused of playing a central role in what officials are calling an “ambush” at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas on July 4, Fox4 reported.The suspect is believed to have fired on law enforcement officers using two AR-15-style rifles from a concealed position in nearby woods. Investigators say he was part of a group of about 10 to 12 individuals who staged a coordinated assault on the ICE facility.Song faces six federal charges, including three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and three counts of discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Investigators say he fired about 20 to 30 rounds at two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer, who was shot in the neck and is expected to recover.Song is 32 years old hailing from Dallas, Texas. He served in the US Marine Corps Reserves from 2011 to 2016, receiving an other than honorable discharge at the end of his service.After the July 4 attack, officials believe he hid overnight in the woods near the detention facility.He may have later been spotted on surveillance cameras at DFW Airport on Sunday.Investigators say the attack was highly coordinated, with suspects dressed in military-style black clothing and body armor, and some even covered in mud for concealment. While nearly 70 law enforcement officers responded quickly and arrested ten suspects, Song managed to escape.The FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song’s arrest, describing him as armed and dangerous.","Benjamin Hanil Song is accused of playing a central role in what officials are calling an ‘ambush’ at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas on July 4.

'Targeted women': ICC issues arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders; Taliban calls it 'nonsense',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/targeted-women-icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-two-top-taliban-leaders-taliban-calls-it-nonsense/articleshow/122330890.cms,"International Criminal Court (Official website image)

Taliban Reject International Criminal Court's Pressure On Women's Rights Issues In Afghanistan





The International Criminal Court on Tuesday (local time) issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan, CNN reported.In a statement, ICC clarified that the two men, Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani are accused of encouraging the abuse of women, girls and others who don’t adhere with the Taliban’s policy on gender.In response, the Taliban called the arrest warrants “nonsense” and said they don’t recognize the ICC. They also accused the court of showing hatred toward Islam by calling their interpretation of Islamic law a crime.Back in January, the ICC’s chief prosecutor said the duo has been criminally responsible for carrying out gender-based persecution since at least August 15, 2021, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh restrictions on women and girls. Girls are banned from attending school beyond sixth grade. Women must cover their entire bodies and faces in public and are not allowed to speak to or look at men outside their families.The sound of women’s voices in public has also been restricted.The ICC said the Taliban have especially targeted women and girls because of their gender, taking away their basic rights and freedom.“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday.“Specifically, the Taliban severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion,” it continued.The regime has also targeted people who support women’s rights and LGBTQ people whose identities don’t fit the Taliban’s rules on gender.The arrest warrants were issued one day after the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution expressing deep concern about the worsening oppression of women and girls in Afghanistan. The UN called on the Taliban to quickly reverse these policies.Lisa Davis, ICC’s Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said this is the first time an international court has recognized LGBTQ people as victims of crimes against humanity for gender persecution, according to media reports.Human rights groups have welcomed the ICC move. Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard called it an important step toward holding those responsible accountable.Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch said the arrest warrants could provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.",International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders.

The latest addition to Barbie’s Fashionistas line is not a runway model but a real‑world rendition. Dressed in a sky‑blue polka‑dot crop top, matching ruffled miniskirt and chunky heels, the new Barbie carries an insulin pump at her waist and a continuous glucose monitor on her arm, representing the first-ever doll to represent type 1 diabetes.Mattel, the prime manufacturer of Barbie dolls collaborated with Breakthrough T1D (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) to mirror the growing reality of society with growing cases of diabetes, especially among children.Barbie dolls have come a long way since their 1959 debut, when they ideally represented white, rail‑thin, and locked into the single occupation of a fashion model. Over the years, Mattel has pushed the envelope on inclusivity, adding more than 175 different looks that vary in skin tone, body type, hairstyle and ability.In recent years, the Fashionistas collection has included dolls with behind‑the‑ear hearing aids, a blind Barbie with a cane, a doll sporting a prosthetic leg, another with vitiligo, and another with Down syndrome. By adding type 1 diabetes to the order, Barbie dolls will serve as a beacon of hope among children who will see their own stories and those of their friends.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system targets insulin‑producing pancreatic cells, leaving patients dependent on insulin delivered by injection or pump.Mattel captures that medical condition in a miniature doll, with a waist‑mounted pump, button‑sized sensor held by heart‑shaped tape, and a light‑blue purse stocked with supplies and snacks to steady blood sugar highs and lows.

A striking video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media. It appeared as strong storms hit the region, with weather officials warning about flash floods and severe thunderstorms in and around the capital.The video, shared on X, was reportedly taken in Bowie, Maryland. It shows a dark, low cloud spreading across the suburbs. As the cloud passed, the daylight suddenly dimmed, making the area look like it was in an eerie twilight.An X user posted, ""Shelf cloud seen moving through the DC area while flash flood, thunderstorm, and tornado warnings were active. The cloud (video below) was filmed in Bowie, Maryland.""According to a report by the Washington Post, tornado, thunderstorm, and flash flood warnings were in effect across parts of the region when the shelf cloud was spotted. While the most intense storms had moved east of the capital by late evening, heavy rain lingered, particularly in and around DC, prompting a flood watch and a severe thunderstorm alert to remain in place for several counties.Meteorologists say shelf clouds are often seen at the leading edge of powerful storm systems. Typically accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, they serve as visual indicators of potentially dangerous weather.Although shelf clouds themselves are not tornadoes, they often precede conditions conducive to severe thunderstorms or tornadic activity.According to WTOP, the severe thunderstorm watch remained in effect until 9pm, while flood advisories continued late into the night. Local stations also reported temporary ground halts at airports like Reagan National and Dulles, as safety measures were enacted.Local authorities urged residents to remain indoors during the peak of the storm and to exercise caution as downpours may continue into the night, threatening low-lying areas with potential flooding.More severe weather could still be on the cards, as officials monitor the weather conditions. Residents have been advised to stay tuned to local forecasts and emergency alerts.","A video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media.

Tariff war: How US decides who pays more; Trump spells out the 'formula',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tariff-war-how-us-decides-who-pays-more-trump-spells-out-the-formula/articleshow/122354241.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his administration’s new round of steep import tariffs, saying they were calculated using “common sense,” trade deficits, and how the United States had been treated historically by other countries.In a press briefing, Trump said, “The formula was a formula based on common sense, based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers. Brazil, as an example, has been not good to us, not good at all.”“But they're based on very, very substantial facts and also past history. You look at the past history - we’ve been. We never had anybody in the White House that understood the numbers or were into it like I have,” he added.This comes as Trump announced new import tariffs targeting several countries - including a 50 per cent duty on Brazil.Other countries affected include the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq, and Sri Lanka, with tariffs ranging between 20 and 30 per cent.Earlier on Monday, Trump shot tariff letters to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, where duties range from 25 to 40 per cent.The total list now includes over 20 countries, as part of Trump’s ongoing crackdown on what he terms “non-reciprocal” trade practices.The new tariffs will come into effect from August 1, 2025.Previously, the Trump administration used a formula that calculated tariffs by taking the US trade deficit in goods with a specific country, dividing it by total imports from that country, and then halving the result.A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more physical goods than it exports.","US President Donald Trump defended his administration’s new round of steep import tariffs, saying they were calculated using “common sense,” trade deficits, and how the United States had been treated historically by other countries.

"Epstein client list: Megyn Kelly blasts Pam Bondi, calls her 'too lazy' as MAGA wants her to resign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-client-list-megyn-kelly-blasts-pam-bondi-calls-her-too-lazy-as-maga-wants-her-to-resign/articleshow/122350720.cms,"Megyn Kelly says Pam Bondi's days in Trump administration are number after her massive Epstein fail.

What Trump said on no ' Epstein client list '







Right-wing commentator Meghyn Kelly has been the latest to turn on Attorney General Pam Bondi after the US administration closed the Epstein case forever, announcing that the convicted sex offender indeed died by suicide in his prison cell, and he did not have a list of clients. The joint memo of the DOJ and the FBI led to a major meltdown of the MAGA activists, as releasing Epstein files was one of the promises that the Donald Trump administration promised with certainty.Megyn Kelly said onher show that Pam Bondi's days are numbered as a member of the Trump administration. “Pam Bondi knew she was about to embarrass some of his most loyal surrogates out there, and did that willingly, or she didn’t take the time to make sure what was in those binders,” Kelly said. “It was all publicly released information that had already been out there…She was too lazy to actually figure out none of this is new, and yet she called a meeting with the influencers that included Kash Patel, the head of the FBI, and the sitting vice president. ”“Then she acted indignant. She didn’t know. It was the sleazy FBI who had withheld the real documents from her,” Kelly said. “She was going to get to the bottom of it.Then she said further release would come. One did not come. Then she was caught on tape saying there are tens of thousands of kiddie porn or child pornography material that we found, which again, is like, a third issue over here. And next thing we know there’s no there there. ”“They f***ed up because they trusted her,” Kelly said. “They were humiliated because she gave them all these binders that read ‘Epstein Files,’ you know, ‘Volume 1,’ and there was nothing new in there. Nothing. There was no scoop. Why would she do that?”Bondi claimed she never said there was a client list waiting on her desk during a February Fox News interview, and what she was referring to was the overall Epstein file. She also claimed the files not released were child porn which would not be made public after she previously teased “truckloads” of evidence.When Trump was asked about his administration failing to keep its promise of releasing Epstein list, and instead coming up with the defense that there is no list, Trump expressed wonder that people are still talking about Epstein. ""Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?"" Trump said. ""This guy, we have been talking about for years. You are asking... We have Texas and other issues, and people are still talking about this creep guy that is unbelievable. You are a waste of time. I mean, I can't believe you are asking a question about him and at a time like this, when we are having some of the greatest success and tragedy with what happened in Texas. It seems like a disaggregation.""","Megyn Kelly said onher show that Pam Bondi's days are numbered as a member of the Trump administration.

Linda Yaccarino took to social media X to reshare a post for standing up and fighting for free speech hours after she stepped down as the CEO of Elon Musk ’s X. “The fight continues….,” Linda posted, resharing a post from Mike Benz, a former official with the US Department of State.The post said: “Linda stood up and fought for free speech during arguably its most acute crisis moment in world history when we were almost on the brink of losing it. She stepped up for all of us in the face of what seemed like insurmountable pressure from governments, advertisers, boycotters, banking institutions, and astroturfed lynch mobs. Thank Linda for her service and excited for her next chapter!”Yaccarino was hired by Musk in May 2023 after he had taken over the platform, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. Mark asserted that at the time that Yaccarino would mainly focus on business operations while he would look after product design and new technology.“Being the CEO of X was always going to be a tough job, and Yaccarino lasted in the role longer than many expected.

I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App. I’m incredibly proud of the X team - the historic business turn around we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable,” her post read.Yaccarino's future at X grew uncertain earlier this year after Musk merged the platform with his AI venture, xAI. Advertising challenges have persisted, as many companies scaled back spending which was X’s primary revenue source, amid concerns that looser content moderation under Musk has allowed hateful and toxic speech to spread.Most recently, an update to Grok triggered a wave of antisemitic responses from the chatbot, including praise for Adolf Hitler.Yaccarino did not publicly comment on the controversy regarding hate speech on X.","Linda Yaccarino steps down as CEO of Elon Musk's X social media platform.

Vice President JD Vance recently tore into New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and asked who he thinks he is, having no shred of gratitude to the country. The case in point was Mamdani's July 4 social media post in which he wrote: ""America is beautiful, contradictory, unfinished. I am proud of our country even as we constantly strive to make it better, to protect and deepen our democracy, to fulfill its promise for each and every person who calls it home.

Vance continued. ""Has he ever visited the grave site of a loved one who gave their life to build the kind of society where his family could escape racial theft and racial violence?

Former White House doctor, Kevin O'Connor has refused to answer questions on the declining cognitive health of former US president Joe Biden on Wednesday, exercising his constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment for self-incrimination.Dr O’Connor swiftly left the House office building after what was intended to be a transcribed interview with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee behind closed doors, as per the Washington Times.“‘Were you ever told to lie about the president’s health?’ He pleaded the Fifth Amendment,” said Oversight chairman James Comer while referring to the two questions that were asked to O’Connor. “‘Did you ever believe President Biden was unfit to execute his duties?’ Again, President Biden’s White House physician pleaded the Fifth Amendment.” the chairman added, as reported by the New York Post.The only question to which O’Connor provided an answer to was a confirmation of his name, as per an Oversight spokesperson, before he quickly left the House office building.David Schertler, one of O’Connor’s attorneys, said the doctor was left with “no choice” but to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights during his testimony before the committee, as reported by AP.“This is unprecedented, and I think that this adds more fuel to the fire that there was a cover-up,” commented Comer. “Clearly there was a conspiracy to cover up,” said Comer in a subsequent statement. “We will continue to interview more Biden White House aides to get the answers Americans deserve,” he added.“There’s more and more evidence that comes out every day that would suggest that the president was in a pretty severe mental decline, so we’re going to ask about that,” Comer said.“We can’t have the physician’s office not being truthful about the health condition of the president,” he said adding that the interview is part of a broader investigation into who in the Biden White House was authorized to use the autopen for signing executive actions and pardons.Biden has strongly rejected the claims questioning his mental fitness during his tenure calling them ""ridiculous and false,"", as per AP.Comer also referred to the book “Original Sin” published by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, in May 20, and asserted that O’Connor decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment further solidifies claims made in that book.The authors alleged that there exists a “Politburo” of close senior advisers, including Annie Tomasini, who served as the “ultimate decision makers” in the previous administration.Other alleged “Politburo” members who are scheduled for interviews with the Oversight panel include Ron Klain, the former White House chief of staff on July 24, Steve Ricchetti, former counselor to the president on July 30, Mike Donilon, former senior adviser on July 31 and Bruce Reed the former deputy chief of staff for police on August 5.Anita Dunn, who had stepped down as senior adviser in Biden White House in August 2024, is scheduled for a transcribed interview on August 7.The panel has started scheduling interviews with former Biden allies to assess whether they were administering the role of the presidency instead of former US president Joe Biden due to his alleged cognitive decline, as reported by the Washington Times.The next interview is scheduled for Friday with Ashley Williams, the former Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations.","Former White House doctor, Kevin O'Connor has refused to answer questions on the declining cognitive health of former US president Joe Biden.

The devastating floods sweeping through central Texas have claimed at least 119 lives, with over 160 people still unaccounted for, reports CNN.The catastrophe has triggered fresh scrutiny of the country’s emergency response model, especially as US President Donald Trump, who recently proposed phasing out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is now touting a swift federal response to the crisis.Concerns are also mounting over whether proper precautions were taken in the days before the floods. Records obtained by CNN show that a state inspector had cleared Camp Mystic, where 27 people died, as having an emergency plan just two days before the disaster. The revelation has sparked new questions about how effectively that plan was followed.Governor Abbott, who toured the affected areas recently, said the state’s emergency alert system would be reviewed in a special legislative session this month.Despite Trump’s previous statements about wanting to ""wean off of FEMA"" and shift responsibility to states, his administration is now highlighting how quickly FEMA has responded to the Texas disaster. The president approved Governor Greg Abbott’s request for a major disaster declaration within a day, unlocking federal assistance for affected residents and local authorities.In a Cabinet meeting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Trump, “We’re cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it, much like your vision of how FEMA should operate.”She added that the federal support to Texas resembled the ""state block grants"" model championed by the president.However, former FEMA officials argued the agency’s current involvement reflects its traditional role rather than any substantial shift. “This is a defining event that can help them realise that a Federal Emergency Management Agency is essential,” said Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under Presidents Obama and Biden. “Imagine if an event like this happened a year from now, after FEMA is eliminated.”","Floods sweeping through central Texas have claimed at least 119 lives, with over 160 people still unaccounted for.

"Beijing, Ankara hail PAF’s combat edge amid tensions with India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/beijing-ankara-hail-pafs-combat-edge-amid-tensions-with-india/articleshow/122349627.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.","Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world.

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"
Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state.

The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

Pakistan's development rests on backs of child labourers as 1.6 million children are exploited in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-development-rests-on-backs-of-child-labourers-as-1-6-million-children-are-exploited-in-sindh/articleshow/122266006.cms,".





Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024, as reported by Dawn. The survey, conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from UNICEF and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, paints a grim picture of child welfare in the province.According to Dawn, the survey found that 50.4 per cent of children aged 10-17 engaged in child labour were working under hazardous conditions, including long hours, exposure to extreme temperatures, and use of unsafe tools. These children face daily risks that threaten their physical and mental well-being.Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who served as the project director for the survey, told Dawn that while the overall incidence of child labour has declined by nearly 50 per cent compared to 1996, when 20.6 per cent of Sindh's child population was in labour, the sheer number of children still involved remains alarming.The survey also uncovered a stark divide in school attendance between working and non-working children. Only 40.6 per cent of children involved in labour attend school, compared to 70.5 per cent of their non-working peers. Attendance sharply declines as working children age, the report highlighted.According to Dawn, the burden is especially heavy for girls aged 14 to 17, who perform an average of 13.9 hours of household chores per week and face higher dropout rates.Child labour remains strongly correlated with poverty, with 33.7 per cent of the poorest households reporting at least one child in labour. Furthermore, 20.1 per cent of working children reported symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate of children not involved in labour, noted the survey.The highest child labour rates were recorded in Qambar Shahdadkot (30.8 per cent), Tharparkar (29 per cent), Shikarpur (20.2 per cent), and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3 per cent), with Karachi recording the lowest at 2.38 per cent, according to Dawn.The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and poverty alleviation to protect vulnerable children. Without decisive action, the cycle of exploitation, poor education, and mental distress will persist for millions across Sindh.","Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment.

""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate. ""Many did not heed my warning,"" he said, adding that about 40 families lived in the building.Shankar Kamho, 30, said his wife called him when she noticed the cracks. ""I told her to get out immediately,"" he said. His wife warned the neighbours, but one woman reportedly replied, ""This building will stand for at least 10 more years"".

Hasina faces tribunal, sentenced in contempt case





The interim government of Bangladesh, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus , on Wednesday called on India to act with ""conscience and moral clarity"" over its handling of a formal request to extradite former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who is facing charges of crimes against humanity.The statement follows a December 2024 note verbal, a formal diplomatic communication, sent by Dhaka to New Delhi, requesting Hasina’s extradition. While India acknowledged receiving the note, it has not commented further, prompting sharp criticism from Dhaka.“For too long, India has refused to comply with Bangladesh’s lawful request for the extradition of Sheikh Hasina,” said Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, in a post on social media. He added that India’s position was “no longer tenable” and warned that “regional friendship, strategic considerations, or political legacy” could not justify “the deliberate murder of civilians.”The statement came a day after BBC Bangla published a report featuring a leaked phone call that allegedly captured Hasina ordering security forces to shoot student protesters during last year’s nationwide uprising.Alam cited the BBC Eye Investigations unit’s findings, claiming they confirmed Hasina's direct role in “state-sanctioned murder.” He urged the international community to take note, especially as a “global institution like the BBC” had dedicated significant resources to investigating alleged abuses in Bangladesh.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 in Bangladesh is set to decide on July 10 whether charges will be formally framed against Hasina and two of her top aides. This follows a ruling last week in which the 77-year-old Awami League leader was sentenced to six months in prison in absentia in a contempt of court case.The tribunal proceedings mark the first sentencing against Hasina since she left office in August last year, after her nearly 16-year rule ended with a mass uprising and her subsequent flight to India.According to a UN human rights report, as many as 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and August 15, 2024, during a brutal security crackdown on demonstrators under Hasina’s government. Most of the Awami League leadership and key officials have either been arrested or are in hiding as the interim administration continues its sweeping crackdown.India has so far not issued a public response to the latest appeal.","Bangladesh calls on India to act with ""conscience and moral clarity"" Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina is facing charges of crimes against humanity.

Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Sentenced to Jail For Six Months by International Crimes Tribunal





DHAKA: The charge of ""crimes against humanity"" is inapplicable to former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina as the cases she is being tried for are part of a political conflict and not a war, her state-appointed lawyer argued on Monday in the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which has set July 10 for framing charges against her and two of her close aides.Stating that according to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, only acts committed during war can be prosecuted as ""crimes against humanity"", Hasina's counsel Amir Hossain sought exemption for the Awami League politician, who is being tried in absentia.

The Indian plate is gradually sliding beneath the Eurasian plate in a process known as subduction, creating immense pressure and strain in the region.

Their wellbeing updates have come solely through three welfare checks conducted by UK embassy officials, the most recent in May.""That's tough when you're used to hearing someone's voice every day,"" he said. ""You always go back to how they must be feeling, that's the one thing that gets the family the most.""He also spoke about the June conflict between Iran and Israel, calling the period “terrifying,” as the family had no idea if the couple were “okay or safe.”The couple, both 52, were due to be transferred to Evin prison on June 8. The facility was later bombed by Israel on June 23.The escalation prompted the UK government to evacuate its embassy staff from the city.Craig and Lindsay Foreman were on what their family described as a “once-in-a-lifetime” motorbike trip across the world. They entered Iran from Armenia on December 30 last year, staying in hotels in Tabriz, Tehran, and Isfahan, but never reached their next destination, Kerman. They were arrested in January.Bennett said the family had raised concerns about their plans to travel to Iran, but emphasised that his parents had followed official procedures.“They had the right visas, were accompanied by licensed tour guides, and stayed in accommodations along main roads,” he said.""They followed every guideline in the book they could… that clearly wasn't enough.""In February, a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary claimed the couple had entered the country “under the guise of tourists” and “gathered information” in various regions.The UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) currently advises against all travel to Iran, warning that British nationals and those with dual British-Iranian citizenship are at “significant risk” of arrest, questioning, or detention.""We know where we stand and what we want, it's over to you to make this happen,"" Bennett said, urging the foreign office to act.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities. We're providing them with consular assistance and we remain in close contact with the family.”","Craig and Lindsay Foreman were on what their family described as a “once-in-a- lifetime” motorbike trip across the world.

London: Norman Tebbit, one of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's most loyal supporters, who was seriously injured in an Irish Republican bombing, has died at the age of 94, his son said on Tuesday.The former Conservative Party cabinet minister had to be dug out of the rubble at the Grand Hotel in Brighton on the southern English coast following the IRA's attempt to assassinate Thatcher during a party conference in 1984.""At 11:15 pm on 7th July, 2025, Lord Tebbit died peacefully at home aged 94,"" his son William said in a statement.Tebbit's wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down as a result of the Brighton bombing.He stepped back from frontline politics in 1987 following Thatcher's third general election victory to care for her.Famed for his combative style, between 1981 and 1987 he served as employment secretary, trade and industry secretary and Conservative Party chairman.In the early 1980s, during a period of high unemployment and riots, Tebbit made headlines with his uncompromising response to the unrest.""I grew up in the 1930s with an unemployed father,"" he said.""He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work and he kept looking until he found it,"" he added.The comment was often misquoted as telling the unemployed to ""get on your bike"" and was used by the left to portray him as lacking compassion.The 1980s satirical television series Spitting Image depicted him as a leather clad hardman complete with metal chains, to his amusement.Tory Party leader Kemi Badenoch described Tebbit as ""an icon in British politics"" and paid tribute to his ""enormous intellect and profound sense of duty to his country"".She said that as part of Thatcher's administration, he had been one of the main agents of the country's ""transformation"", in particular by confronting the power of the trade unions.But she said that ""to many of us it was the stoicism and courage he showed in the face of terrorism"" and his selfless care for his wife that underlined that he was ""first and foremost a family man who always held true to his principles"".","Norman Tebbit, one of Margaret Thatcher's most loyal supporters, has died at the age of 94.

'Deport them all': British woman enraged by Indian staff at Heathrow airport for not speaking English; netizens react,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/deport-them-all-british-woman-enraged-by-indian-staff-at-heathrow-airport-for-not-speaking-english-netizens-react/articleshow/122312668.cms,"DMK MP Kanimozhi’s Reply To Question On India's National Language Wins Applause In Spain

Poll Do you think diversity in airport staff enhances the travel experience? Yes, it reflects global inclusivity No, it affects communication standards





A British woman has triggered widespread outrage on social media after posting a xenophobic rant about Indian and Asian staff at London’s Heathrow Airport, accusing them of not speaking English and demanding their deportation.In a post that went viral on X, Lucy White, public policy specialist at University of Cambridge Alumna said, ""Just landed in London Heathrow. Majority of staff are Indian/ Asian & are not speaking a word of English. I said to them, 'Speak English'. Their reply, 'You’re being racist'. They know I’m right, so they have to use the race card. Deport them all. Why are they working at the first point of entry to the UK?! What must tourists think…""The woman’s remarks have drawn severe criticism online, with many netizens condemning the post.""Why is that British people are not applying for those jobs???If the British people were filling up those jobs then those Indians wouldn’t have been recruited,"" a user commented.""So they told you correctly, in English, that you’re being racist?"" another user questioned.Dismissing her experience, a user wrote, ""This is mere propaganda. I know very well how strict the scrutiny is. Language aside, they even judge the accent.It’s a very tough job. The poor staff members do their best to keep every passenger satisfied. By making such baseless allegations, you’re revealing your true character.""A notable number of users expressed agreement with her frustration, albeit in less aggressive terms. ""I hate to agree with you! Landed in Heathrow last week! It was an absolute nightmare,"" a user said.""Last time I went through Heathrow, it was over two hours before I met an English person. Everyone at the airport was either south Asian or African. The Uber driver was Romanian. The drive through London was the most dramatic example of population replacement I can imagine,"" said another.""It's the same in Canada. I was in Halifax airport recently and the airport announcer was the most Indian sounding person they could have hired. The crazy thing is when you get out of the airport though. You get to a town in the middle of nowhere and there is always an Indian running the gas station or variety store,"" a user said.","A British woman has triggered widespread outrage on social media after posting a xenophobic rant about Indian and Asian staff at London’s Heathrow Airport.

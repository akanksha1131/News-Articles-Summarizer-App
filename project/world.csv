New visa rules and automatic cancellation

Aim: Efficient crowd management and improved pilgrim experience

Record numbers in the current Umrah season









Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced key amendments to the Umrah visa system, reducing the pre-entry validity period from three months to one month. The new rule, which takes effect next week, aims to improve crowd management as the Kingdom anticipates a significant rise in pilgrim arrivals following the end of summer.According to, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has implemented changes to the Umrah visa regulations to streamline the arrival process. Under the new policy, Umrah visas will now be automatically canceled 30 days after issuance if the pilgrim has not entered Saudi Arabia within that timeframe.Previously, pilgrims had up to three months from the date of visa issuance to travel to the Kingdom. The revised policy now limits that pre-entry window to one month, tightening the timeframe for pilgrims to schedule their visits. However, once pilgrims enter Saudi Arabia, the duration of stay remains unchanged at three months, ensuring visitors still have ample time to complete their pilgrimage and other religious activities.The ministry confirmed that these updated rules will come into effect next week.Explaining the reasoning behind the changes, Ahmed Bajaeifer, adviser to the National Committee for Umrah and Visit, toldthat the adjustment aligns with the ministry’s broader preparations for an expected surge in Umrah pilgrims.The increase is anticipated as temperatures drop in Mecca and Medina, marking the end of the summer season, a period traditionally followed by a sharp rise in pilgrimage activity.Bajaeifer emphasized that the goal is to enable authorities to better organize and manage the growing number of visitors, prevent overcrowding in the two holy cities, and maintain a smooth and safe experience for all pilgrims.Since the start of the new Umrah season in early June, Saudi Arabia has already issued more than four million Umrah visas to international pilgrims. This marks a record-breaking turnout compared to previous seasons, with this year’s figures surpassing expectations within just five months of the season’s launch.Officials say the new measures are part of ongoing efforts to ensure that the expanding number of pilgrims can be accommodated safely and efficiently, while also maintaining the high quality of services provided in Mecca and Medina.","Saudi Arabia cuts Umrah visa pre-entry validity to one month, effective next week, for pilgrims.

How the espionage unfolded

had affected intelligence communities in Australia and the United States.”





Court proceedings and prosecution’s argument

“it’s very important no-one has promised you anything about what I’m going to do [in sentencing],”

Government reaction and statements

“America's national security is NOT FOR SALE, especially in an evolving threat landscape where cybercrime poses a serious danger to our citizens.

Thank you to all the attorneys who worked so hard to secure this guilty plea.”

“Williams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software to a foreign broker that touted its ties to Russia and other foreign governments. His conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperilling our national security for the sake of personal gain. Today’s guilty plea reflects our commitment to ensuring that insiders who abuse their positions of trust face serious consequences.”

“We continue to vigorously investigate those who betray our national security by selling valuable US trade secrets to international cyber brokers who support foreign cyber actors. These international cyber brokers are the next wave of international arms dealers and we continue to be vigilant about their activities. The conduct here caused over $35 million of loss to a company in the District of Columbia and allowed non-allied foreign cyber actors to obtain sophisticated cyber exploits that were likely used against numerous unsuspecting victims.”

“Williams placed greed over freedom and democracy by stealing and reselling $35 million of cyber trade secrets from a US cleared defence contractor to a Russian Government supplier. By doing so, he gave Russian cyber actors an advantage in their massive campaign to victimise US citizens and businesses. This plea sends a clear message that the FBI and our partners will defend the homeland and bring to justice anyone who helps our adversaries jeopardise US national security.""

“Peter Williams betrayed the United States and our allies by selling trade secrets. The harm caused by his crimes cannot be undone. The FBI and our partners will aggressively investigate and hold accountable anyone who threatens US national security.”





Who is Peter Williams

Next steps and sentencing





An Australian cybersecurity executive has pleaded guilty in a US court to stealing and selling highly sensitive defence software to a Russian cyber-broker. The case, described by US authorities as a “betrayal of national security”, involves stolen cyber tools worth tens of millions of dollars and marks one of the most serious insider breaches in recent years.Peter Joseph Williams, 39, an Australian national and former executive at defense contractor L3Harris, pleaded guilty before the US District Court in Washington, D.C., to two counts of theft of trade secrets.According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Williams “stole and resold” software components designed for national security purposes, including at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit tools. These were meant to be sold “exclusively to the US government and select allies,” prosecutors said.The material, stolen over a three-year period between 2022 and 2025, was sold to a Russian cyber-tools broker that publicly advertises itself as a reseller of exploits to various customers, including the Russian government.Each charge carries a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the offence.According to court documents and Williams’s signed plea, he exploited his security clearance and access to his employer’s restricted digital infrastructure to copy classified material. He then sold the stolen components to a Russian broker in exchange for cryptocurrency, receiving around $ US 1.3 million (A$2 million) for his role in the scheme.Prosecutors said Williams used an alias,to conceal his identity and maintain encrypted communication channels with the Russian buyer. The contracts he signed involved both upfront and periodic payments for continued technical support.Assistant US Attorney Tejpal Chawla, one of the lead federal prosecutors handling the case in the District of Columbia, told the court that the stolen softwareadding that Williams’s actions “Court documents estimate the losses to the Washington D.C.–based defence company at $US35 million, with the stolen tools believed to have been resold to non-allied cyber actors “likely used against numerous unsuspecting victims.”During the plea hearing, Williams appeared subdued, bowing his head as prosecutors detailed his actions. He admitted to stealing the data, transferring it via encrypted means, and using the proceeds to purchase high-value luxury items, including jewellery, watches, and designer accessories.Authorities have since seized his Washington D.C. residence, funds from multiple accounts, and a collection of 22 watches — five of which were counterfeit Rolexes.Judge Loren AliKhan, who presided over the hearing, warned Williams thatnoting that deportation would follow any custodial sentence.Williams remains under home detention in Washington D.C. until sentencing on 27 January, where he faces over a decade in prison. His lawyer, John Rowley, told ABC outside court: “Oh, he’s going to get a custodial sentence.”US government officials issued a series of forceful statements following Williams’s guilty plea, condemning his actions as a grave betrayal of national security.US Attorney-General Pamela Bondi said:Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg added:US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Ferris Pirro, in an official statement from the Justice Department, described the incident as part of a broader threat landscape.FBI Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said:Separately, FBI agent Alexander Arnott added in a statement:Williams has a long background in cybersecurity and intelligence, having previously worked for both public and private sector organisations in Australia and the United States. Multiple sources confirmed to ABC that he had worked for the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) during the 2010s.The ASD is responsible for foreign signals intelligence, cybersecurity, and offensive cyber operations under government direction.Before his arrest, Williams served as general manager of Trenchant, a defence subcontractor that develops hacking tools and software for the Five Eyes intelligence network, comprising Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.His crimes, prosecutors argued, represented a profound breach of trust, not only against his employer but also against the security partnership linking those allied nations.Williams is scheduled for sentencing on 27 January 2026, with prosecutors recommending a sentence exceeding 10 years under US federal guidelines. The presiding judge has discretion to impose a longer term.Authorities emphasised that the plea agreement ensures accountability for “insiders who compromise national security for profit,” with all proceeds of the crimes subject to seizure.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant US Attorneys Tejpal Chawla and Jason McCullough for the District of Columbia, Trial Attorney Prava Palacharla for the National Security Division’s (NSD) National Security Cyber Section, and Trial Attorney Nicholas Hunter for NSD’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.","Peter Joseph Williams, 39, an Australian national and former executive at defense contractor L3Harris, pleaded guilty before the US District Court in Washington, D.C., to two counts of theft of trade secrets.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

What is the Dunki route? 50 Haryana men deported from US after chasing a Shah Rukh Khan-style dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-dunki-route-50-haryana-men-deported-from-us-after-chasing-a-shah-rukh-khan-style-dream/articleshow/124857658.cms,"What is the Dunki route?



Dunki Disaster: 50 Haryana Boys Return in Handcuffs, Families Ruined As Agents Disappear After Scam

From hope to heartbreak in Haryana



Trump-era crackdown







At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States. Their pursuit of the “American dream” took them through the infamous dunki route — a perilous, illegal path across continents that promises hope but often ends in heartbreak and jail cells.In Shah Rukh Khan’s 2023 film Dunki, the term symbolises the dangerous journey many Indians take to reach countries like the US, UK, or Canada without proper visas. The story follows four friends from Punjab chasing a better life abroad through smugglers, only to face violence, betrayal, and despair. The film’s mix of humour and tragedy mirrors the real-life struggles of countless migrants who risk everything for foreign dreams on a daily basis.Naresh Kumar, one of 14 deported youths from Kaithal, said he sold his farmland and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to reach the US through Panama’s dense jungles. “I sold my agricultural land and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to go to the US via the Panama jungle route. After spending 14 months in jail, I was deported,” he told reporters.Naresh added that the agent extorted money at every stage. “He took Rs 42 lakh initially, then Rs 6 lakh in Guatemala, another Rs 6 lakh when I reached Mexico, and the rest was taken when we crossed the border.But instead of helping me reach the US safely, they got me arrested and put in jail,” he said, urging others to avoid the dunki route.Officials confirmed that 16 deportees were from Karnal, 14 from Kaithal, five from Kurukshetra, three from Jind, and others from Ambala and Panipat. “The youths were brought from the Delhi airport by CM squad personnel and handed over to their families at the police lines,” said DSP Sandeep Kumar of Karnal.Kaithal SP Upasana added, “All records are being checked thoroughly and one person was found to have a criminal background.”Jind SP Kuldeep Singh warned, “Travelling abroad through the ‘dunki’ route is a serious criminal offence and also tarnishes the image of our society. Such illegal journeys not only lead to financial loss but also pose a grave threat to life. In many cases, youths face physical abuse, fraud, and even death along the way.”Under Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, the dunki dream has turned darker than ever. Across Haryana, families who once hoped for a better life abroad now watch their sons return home in handcuffs, as authorities tighten their grip on illegal migration networks and agents who sell false promises.","At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States.

"UAE issues final Emiratisation warning to private sector: AED 108,000 fine per missing Emirati by Dec 31",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-final-emiratisation-warning-to-private-sector-aed-108000-fine-per-missing-emirati-by-dec-31/articleshow/124847506.cms,"UAE pushes private sector to boost Emirati workforce / AI-Generated image illustrative purposes only

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.","Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors.

Storm devastates Jamaica: Hurricane Hunters film inside eye of Category 5 Melissa — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/storm-devastates-jamaica-hurricane-hunters-film-inside-eye-of-category-5-melissa-watch/articleshow/124864582.cms,"Hurricane Melissa Turns Into STRONGEST STORM On Earth This Year; Jamaica, Cuba ‘On Knees’

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

Eyes on the federal reserve





Outlook for gold investors





Gold prices in Dubai continued their slide on Tuesday, holding below the Dh500 ($136) mark per gram amid weakness in international bullion markets. As of 7 a.m., 24-karat gold was priced at Dh481.25 ($130.00) per gram, while 22-karat traded at Dh445.50 ($120.29) per gram.The decline mirrors the sharp global sell-off seen Monday when gold tumbled below the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time in weeks, a drop of over 3.2%. Although the metal recovered 0.9% in early Tuesday trading, sentiment remained fragile as traders digested progress in US–China trade talks, which reduced appetite for safe-haven assets.Just a week earlier, on October 21, gold had touched a record Dh525.25 ($141.83) per gram before suffering its steepest single-day fall in more than ten years. Buyers who invested during Diwali’s price peak saw the value of their holdings drop swiftly as global optimism dampened demand for gold.Global crises, such as the Middle East conflict and the war in Ukraine, have stoked demand for bullion, while political turmoil in France and Japan added to the flight to gold.Analysts attribute the slide to renewed hope in trade stability. “With the US–China dispute showing signs of resolution, markets have shifted toward riskier assets, pulling investors away from gold,” said one Dubai-based commodities expert.Attention now turns to the US Federal Reserve, which concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, the second in a row, aimed at cushioning slowing growth and inflationary pressure.Adding to the intrigue, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that five contenders are being vetted to replace Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026, including Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder of BlackRock.With gold currently consolidating after several months of record-breaking gains, market analysts warn that heightened volatility may persist until there’s clearer direction on US monetary policy and broader global trade momentum. For now, cautious traders are closely watching whether the metal can hold above the Dh480 ($130) level, considered a key short-term support.Silver, meanwhile, largely mirrored gold’s trajectory, gradually easing from record highs reached earlier in October, when investors flocked to precious metals amid rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty.","24-karat gold in Dubai traded at Dh481.25 ($131) per gram, marking a sharp post- Diwali decline.

"Saudi's new traffic rule: Prepare to stop at orange light or risk SAR6,000 fine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudis-new-traffic-rule-prepare-to-stop-at-orange-light-or-risk-sar6000-fine/articleshow/124841093.cms,"Why Saudi drivers should treat yellow lights seriously now / AI-generated Image

Saudi traffic rules explained

The SAR 6,000 fine risk you need to know

Practical guidance for drivers

Slow down when you see amber. Treat it as “prepare to stop.” This avoids risky last-second accelerations.

If you’re already past the stop line when amber starts, proceed cautiously, don’t floor it; but understand cameras may capture a red-light crossing if timing lines up.

Don’t use amber as an excuse to speed up or “beat” the light; that behavior is treated as dangerous and can lead to the same penalties as red-light violations.

If fined and you think the ticket is wrong, dispute it through the official MOI/Absher channels automated systems provide evidence and can be reviewed

The takeaway





Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop, not a cue to speed up. While simply passing on amber is not automatically fined, entering or crossing the stop line after the light turns red is treated as a red-light violation carrying steep penalties (SR 3,000–6,000 in severe or repeated cases).The General Directorate of Traffic in Saudi Arabia (Murur) has issued a clear warning to all drivers: the orange (or yellow) traffic light is not a cue to speed up. This transitional light serves a critical safety purpose, marking the final stage before a complete stop. It is meant to be a non-negotiable alert for drivers to immediately begin slowing down. The Murur clarifies that this brief yellow phase is not for aesthetics or a gentle reminder, but a crucial opportunity to prepare for a safe, gradual halt. Ignoring this signal by speeding up or trying to rush through the intersection is classified as a serious driving error. This behavior not only disregards the law but also poses a direct threat to the safety of all road users and their property.The consequences of misinterpreting the orange light can be severe, potentially mirroring the penalties for running a red light. The law views a driver who fails to stop safely during the yellow phase, resulting in them running the subsequent red light, as committing the greater violation.This failure to stop in time can lead to a fine for running a red light, a Category 1 offense. The penalty for this starts at SAR 3,000 and can reach a maximum of SAR 6,000. Furthermore, the fine can be escalated to the maximum amount for repeat offenders or under aggravated conditions. In serious situations, especially if the violation causes an accident with injuries, the driver may face legal accountability and even vehicle impoundment.Keep these straight and simple:The General Directorate of Traffic firmly maintains that strict and consistent adherence to all applicable traffic laws is the sole reliable path to lasting safety. By responsibly respecting the orange light and the entire signaling system, drivers actively contribute to protecting lives and property, and help ensure a predictable, smooth, and sustainable flow of traffic across the Kingdom's expanding road networks.","Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA.

U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





US President Donald Trump on Friday hailed his trip to Southeast Asia, claiming that “great deals” were secured and that the United States is now “respected like never before.” The 47th POTUS said that “money is pouring into the country” thanks to his tariff policies and what he described as the “landslide results” of the 2024 presidential election.In a lengthy post on Truth Social, the US president described his meetings with leaders from across the region — including China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, and others — as proof that “America is respected again — respected like never before.”Trump hailed the success of the trip, which followed a breakthrough meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea that led to both sides easing tariffs, resuming soybean trade, and pausing port and export restrictions for a year. “Great Trade Deals were made, Long Term relationships now exist,” Trump wrote, claiming that his economic policies had triggered renewed investment in the United States.He said the question that “kept coming up” during his meetings was: “How did the Democrats shut down the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it?” Reflecting on that during his return flight, Trump accused Democrats of suffering from what he called a “sick form” of Trump Derangement Syndrome.“They want Trillions of Dollars to be taken from our Healthcare System and given to others, who are not deserving — people who have come into our Country illegally, many from prisons and mental institutions,” he wrote.Trump also urged Republicans to abolish the filibuster, calling on the party to use its “TRUMP CARD.” “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” he said, arguing that Democrats had once tried to do the same under Barack Obama and Harry Reid. “Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats,” he added.The president’s remarks came amid cautious optimism following the US-China agreement, which rolled back several tariffs imposed earlier this year and saw Beijing resume major agricultural imports. China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of American soybeans through January and continue purchases over the next three years, while pausing restrictions on rare earth exports.","US President Donald Trump hailed his trip to Southeast Asia, claiming that “great deals’ were secured.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Confronted with allegations that they had cheated in an introductory data science course and fudged their attendance, dozens of undergraduates at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently sent two professors a mea culpa via email. But there was one problem, a glaring one: They had not written the emails. Artificial intelligence had, according to the professors, Karle Flanagan and Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, an academic pair known to their students and social media followers as the Data Science Duo.The students got their comeuppance in a large lecture hall on Oct 17, when the professors read aloud their identical, less-than-genuine apologies from a projector screen, video from that class showed. Busted.The professors posted about it on social media, where the gotcha moment drew widespread attention.""They said, 'Dear Professor Flanagan, I want to sincerely apologise,'"" Professor Flanagan said. ""And I was like, Thank you. They're owning up to it. They're apologising. And then I got another email, the second email, and then the third. And then everybody sort of sincerely apologising, and suddenly it became a little less sincere.""At a time when educational institutions are grappling with the intrusion of machine learning into classrooms and homework assignments, the university professors said they decided to use the episode to teach a lesson in academic integrity. They did not take disciplinary action against the students. ""You can hear the students laugh in the background of the video,"" Professor Fagen-Ulmschneider said. ""They very well knew that it was something that they could see themselves doing. ""Although the university's student code covers cheating and plagiarism, the professors said that they were not aware of specific rules applying to the use of AI.Allison Copenbarger Vance, a deputy associate chancellor, said in an email that the students would not be punished. ""At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, it is the discretion of faculty to clearly define the boundaries in their syllabi for using AI in student work,"" she said. Referring to Professor Flanagan, she added, ""In this case, the students' behaviour didn't violate the policies outlined in her syllabus, so no disciplinary action was warranted. ""Vinayak Bagdi, 21, who graduated in May with a degree in statistics, took the class as a freshman to fulfill his academic requirements. Four years later, he said, the professors' dedication to demystifying statistics had stuck with him. He described the professors as being heavily invested in the success of students. That made it disheartening that some students had used AI, Bagdi said.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Military:

Federal civilian workers:

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out of the race in July 2024, but ultimately lost to Trump in November.In her new memoir,, Harris recounts concern over Biden’s ability to run for re-election. Speaking to Bartlett, she revealed she had sensed something was “a little off” with Biden months before the election.“He called me from debate camp ... and I could tell something was a little off,” she said. “And I was concerned about—I just, I don't think he wanted to debate, is my point.”The June 2024 debate became infamous for Biden’s shaky performance, where he appeared frail and struggled to finish sentences.Harris said she watched from Los Angeles with a small team, ready to give honest feedback. “There will be something to clean up, and I expected that,” she said. “And then, you know, we saw what we all saw.”In an earlier interview with Rachel Maddow, Harris admitted she regretted not urging Biden to reconsider his re-election bid. “When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself,” she said.Despite the loss, Harris told the BBC this month that she remains open to another presidential run. “I am not done,” she said. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.”","Kamala Harris says she was 'in a state of shock' when told her 2024 presidential campaign was over.

A young MAGA supporter pulled no punches when he asked vice-president JD Vance a pointed question about the possibility of tyranny following the deployment of the National Guard under US President Donald Trump.The exchange took place at the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, in Oxford, Mississippi.The teenager was perched in the audience and wearing a “Freedom” t-shirt and a MAGA cap. He prefaced his question by saying, “I’m a huge supporter of you guys before I make my argument. But there is something you guys are doing that is kind of disturbing me a little bit.”He referenced the military deployment by the Trump administration in Washington, DC and other cities, saying: “They’ve had wonderful results. No one can deny the results of that. Some might even say the greatest.” The fan then posed the main concern: “Let’s say we get a complete tyrant in office… what is the difference between what you’re doing and how can we prevent someone from abusing that power?”Vance replied by acknowledging the question’s legitimacy. He said: “I understand where the question is coming from, and I think it’s a fair question. And it’s going to sound like I’m being sarcastic, and it really is not meant in any offence.” He went on to offer a hypothetical shift of focus: “But when you talk about ‘what could another administration do,’ to take a wild, hypothetical example totally off the top of my head: what if Joe Biden sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation to start arresting his political opponents?”Drawing on his political philosophy, Vance said: “I want every conservative to remember—It’s an important part of my entire political philosophy—we cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future. The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it.”The fan pointed out what he called a “disturbing” trend of using the military for law enforcement inside the country. The National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, alone is said to cost about 1 million dollars a day. A recent Gallup poll also showed that most Americans — around 60 per cent — are against sending troops into cities to control crime, while 39 per cent support the idea.Vance’s appearance at the event came alongside Erika Kirk, widow of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Row erupts over White House’s ‘racist’ Halloween post confusing two Black leaders: ‘Doing wonders for culture’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-white-houses-racist-halloween-post-confusing-two-black-leaders-doing-wonders-for-culture/articleshow/124964518.cms,"



A Halloween-themed social media post by the White House started a row after it appeared to confuse two Black political leaders while trying to mock Democrats.The post on social media platform X featured “Halloween costume inspiration” images comparing President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance with their Democratic rivals, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. However, the caption describing Jeffries’ “costume” seemed to confuse him with Senator Cory Booker.The image of Jeffries showed him wearing a sombrero with a caption that read, “one filibuster speech no one remembers.” The error drew attention because Jeffries serves in the House, where filibusters do not exist. The description appeared to refer instead to Booker’s 25-hour speech in April criticising the Trump administration, which became the longest filibuster-style address in Senate history.The sombrero itself sparked backlash. It appeared to reference a “racist” AI-generated video President Trump shared earlier this month that depicted Jeffries wearing a sombrero and handlebar moustache while mariachi music played. At the time, Jeffries called the video “disgusting,” telling reporters, “Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake AI video.When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.”Vance defended the imagery, saying, “The president’s joking, and we’re having a good time,” before adding that the posts would stop if Jeffries helped reopen the government, according to the Daily Beast.Even Schumer’s mock costume description included another sombrero reference, reading, “Includes: your money given to illegals, life subscription to performative outrage. Not included: sombrero, spine.”","The White House posted a Halloween-themed social media post that appeared to confuse two Black political leaders.

'Telling girls that men are better at being women': JK Rowling fans flames over UK magazine featuring trans models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/telling-girls-that-men-are-better-at-being-women-jk-rowling-stirs-row-over-uk-magazine-featuring-trans-models/articleshow/124959010.cms,"How did Netizens take it?



Rowling's 'gender-war'







JK Rowling started a fresh row over trans rights in Britain after launching an attack on Glamour UK’s “Women of the Year” feature, celebrating nine transgender women.The Harry Potter author posted on X that she grew up in a time when women’s magazines told girls to be “thinner and prettier” — and now, she claimed, those same outlets tell girls “that men are better women than they are. ”Rowling’s remarks accompanied an image of the Glamour feature. The magazine described the group — including model and author Munroe Bergdorf, actor Bel Priestley, and activist Dani St James — as “trans women working across fashion, music, publishing and activism.”However, her post divided social media. Many supported her comments, accusing mainstream media of erasing biological women. “We went from telling girls they weren’t good enough to telling them they’re not even girls anymore,” one user wrote. Another added, “From ‘you’re not thin enough’ to ‘you’re not male enough’ — exactly right.”Others accused Rowling of fuelling hostility toward an already marginalised community. “Your nostalgia for 90s beauty standards ignores how today’s recognition of trans women is progress,” one wrote. Another said, “The trans movement isn’t misogynistic — it’s dismantling the same toxic gatekeeping you’re defending.”The clash is an ongoing consequence of the deepening divide in British public discourse over gender identity. In recent years, Rowling has become a central figure in the so-called “gender war,” frequently clashing with activists and politicians over women’s spaces and trans inclusion. Her supporters view her as a defender of biological sex-based rights; critics accuse her of transphobia and of legitimising anti-trans sentiment in mainstream culture.For Glamour, the feature aimed to spotlight trans women’s resilience amid increasing political hostility and rising hate crimes in the UK. The magazine wrote that “trans people — and especially trans women — are facing a committed attempt from anti-trans groups and politicians to make exclusionary policy the default across British public life.” It said the campaign sought to promote dignity, opportunity, and equality for trans women, particularly in employment and healthcare.The Glamour UK cover is part of the “Protect the Dolls” campaign, which began when designer Conner Ives wore a T-shirt with the slogan during his fashion show earlier this year. He said it was a show of support for his trans friends facing hate in the US. The message quickly spread online, helping raise more than $600,000 for the charity Trans Lifeline and gaining support from stars like Madonna, Pedro Pascal, Troye Sivan, and Mariah Carey.","Harry Potter author attacked Glamour UK’s “Women of the Year’ feature, celebrating nine transgender women.

Subu Vedam case latest update: ICE opposes of Indian-origin man's appeal against 1988's deportation notice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/subu-vedam-case-latest-update-ice-opposes-of-indian-origin-mans-appeal-against-1988s-deportation-notice/articleshow/124959894.cms,"Subu Vedam case latest update: More delay after 43 years in prison as ICE opposes release of Indian-origin man

10 things to know about Subu Vedam case



Subu Vedam was arrested when he was 19 on charges of murdering his friend and roommate, Tom Kinser. Vedam was the last person to be seen with Kinser. It was 1982, two years after Kinser was murdered. In 1983, Vedam was convicted and sentenced to life without parole. In 1988, when he was in jail, his family received a deportation order based on his convictions for murder and also a drug offence. In fact, Subu was detained on drug charges in the first place and later charged with murder. Police reached Subu as Subu asked Kinser for a ride to Lewisburg to buy drugs and that was the last time Kinser was seen. Subu maintained his innocence in the murder case and in 2022, his legal team found out that he was wrongfully convicted because there was a major loophole. The gun that Subu had, based on which he was convicted, did not match the gunshot that was found on Kinser's body. On October 2, the murder charges were dropped against Vedam and he was released a day later. As soon as he was released, he was detained by the ICE who acted on the 1988 deportation order. Subu Vedam remains in ICE custody in Pennsylvania and ICE opposes the effort of his team to plea to the immigration judges to consider the totality of the case. Subu Vedam is now 63 years old. He earned several degrees in prison. His family wants him to live freely in the US and not to be deported to India.





Subu Vedam, the Indian-origin man, who was arrested by the ICE minutes after his release after 43 years of imprisonment in a case in which he was wrongly convicted, will have to wait longer for his final release as the ICE has so far not responded positively to his case. ""He (Vedam) has provided no evidence nor argument to show he has been diligent in pursuing his rights as it pertains to his immigration status,” Katherine B Frisch, an assistant chief counsel, in a brief, in a recent update of the case that has now become a campaign for justice. Vedam was arrested by the ICE, citing that he lost his citizenship in the US, but Vedam's family hopes that immigration judges will consider the totality of his case, as he spent 43 years in jail for a murder that he did not commit. But ICE said the clock ran out years ago.Subu's sister Saraswathi Vedam said her brother remains patient. “He, more than anybody else, knows that sometimes things don’t make sense,” she said. “You have to just stay the course and keep hoping that truth and justice and compassion and kindness will win.”The Vedams were among the first Indian families in the area known as “Happy Valley,” where his father had come as a postdoctoral fellow in 1956. An older daughter was born in State College, but Subu was born when the family was back in India in 1961. The family returned to State College before his first birthday and when he was nine months old, and became the family that welcomed new members of the Indian diaspora to town. Subu's sister Saraswathi is a midwifery professor in Vancouver, British Columbia.","Subu Vedam was arrested when he was 19 on charges of murdering his friend and roommate, Tom Kinser.

"Donald Trump admin ends automatic work permit extensions, placing nearly one lakh Indian spouses at risk of job disruptions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-admin-ends-automatic-work-permit-extensions-placing-nearly-one-lakh-indian-spouses-at-risk-of-job-disruptions/articleshow/124954881.cms,"FULL: ‘Dems, Drop F-bombs, Ignore Americans’: Mike Johnson’s Furious Outburst | US Shutdown Day 30

Associations and immigration experts lambast the new rule:

At a glance:

USCIS is eliminating the maximum 540-day automatic extension of EADs that was available in for H-4 EAD renewals and in some other cases

The interim final rule applies to EAD applications filed on or after Oct 30

Individuals can file for renewal up to 180 days before the current EAD expires. The hitch: application processing typically takes longer. Until renewal, the applicant cannot work, resulting in job disruption

The new rule, which was issued without a public notice and comment period is likely to be challenged in the courts





The US department of homeland security (DHS) has issued an interim final rule that eliminates the automatic extension of work permits or ‘Employment Authorization Documents’ (EADs), for several categories of foreign nationals — including H-4 visa holders (spouses of certain categories of H-1B visa holders). The new rule comes into effect from Oct 30, it is important to note that it does not impact EADs automatically extended before this date.As many as one lakh Indian spouses (largely women) have benefited from the work authorization permit – which in addition to enabling them to work or be self -employed, also enables them to avail of basics such as a driving license. This cohort of individuals will be adversely impacted by the amendment.Under the new rule, individuals will no longer be able to continue working after their current permit expires. They must wait until the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approves and renews the EAD. The hitch: H-4 EAD holders can file renewal applications only up to 180 days before the expiration date, but USCIS typically takes a longer time to process the application. This creates an unavoidable gap.As no grace period is available, immigration experts are of the view that thousands of spouses could lose their jobs simply because their EAD renewal application was not processed in time.The EAD rule was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015, to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment-based green card. Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 (dependent) visa can apply for employment authorization.Previously, USCIS had provided a safeguard: A 2016 rule provided for automatic extension of up to 180 days from the date of expiry of the EAD, this meant that the spouse could continue to work. In spring 2022, USCIS temporarily increased the automatic extension to 540 days. Later with effect from Jan 2025, this rule was made permanent, to prevent any job disruptions caused by processing delays. The new rule eliminates the auto-extension entirely, leaving EAD holders at risk of job terminations.Official statements continue on the lines often touted by the Trump administration: that living and working in the US is not a right but a privilege. DHS stated that that ending automatic extensions of EADs would result in more frequent vetting of aliens (foreign nationals) who apply for employment authorization. Reviewing a foreign national’s background more often will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal, it added.“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said Joseph Edlow, director USCIS.USCIS has recommended that foreign nationals seek a timely renewal of their EAD by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires. The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation.“Even if USCIS is advising that people start the renewal process up to 180 days before, it is likely to take longer than six months. This will cause disruption and delays as employees may no longer be able to work if the EAD has not been renewed prior to the expiration of the current EAD,” said Cyrus D Mehta, immigration attorney.The new rule was published without issuing a notice and inviting public comments; thus it is likely to be challenged in the courts. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) sharply criticized the change, calling it an attack on US businesses and workers. “Without any notice, the administration is pulling the rug out from under employers and workers,” said Jeff Joseph, immigration attorney and President of AILA. “The rule fast-tracks pink slips as employers will have no choice but to fire needed workers,” he emphasized.AILA’s executive director - Ben Johnson added that instead of improving efficiency, “the administration is blowing it up and taking American business and workers down with it.” He stated that people who have been vetted, are legally working, and have complied with renewal requirements will now “be out of work and out of luck due to bureaucratic delays.”Doug Rand, a former DHS official and immigration policy expert, said: “The Trump administration is obliterating grace periods entirely. And you're not allowed to file for a renewed work permit until 6 months before your current card expires. Which means that starting around May 2026 (unless the courts step in), people are going to start losing permission to work in the US even though they followed all the rules.”He added that the Trump administration’s claim that eliminating automatic extensions enhances security is “chest-puffing nonsense.” Rand said: “If they were truly worried about risks, they’d process applications faster — not force people to give up their livelihoods while dressing up inefficiency as national security.”Mehta questioned how eliminating the auto renewal of the EAD will prioritize Americans' safety and security. He viewed that the actual rationale behind this move is to create more obstacles for non-citizens who are here in the US legally.A few days ago, the US Supreme Court had refused to hear an appeal challenging the EAD rule, H-4 visa holders had breathed a sigh of relief. Now, they and their families have to grapple with this emerging challenge.","The US department of homeland security (DHS) has issued an interim final rule that eliminates the automatic extension of work permits or ‘Employment Authorization Documents’ (EADs), for several categories of foreign nationals.

Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Afghanistan Stops Border Operations Against Pakistan Following Mediation By Gulf Countries





Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure a lasting truce after their bloodiest clashes in years were deadlocked Tuesday, with a Pakistani security source saying a ""last-ditch effort"" was under way.

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying Kabul’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness as both sides agreed to maintain a fragile ceasefire after days of failed negotiations.Haqqani warned that if Afghanistan’s patience was tested again, the country would deliver a “crushing” response. “Defending our territory is among our priorities,” he said. “Yet despite all this, the path of understanding remains open. But if someone commits aggression, we have fought the emperors of the world and it is no difficulty for us to defend our territory,” the interior minister said as quoted by TOLOnews.Haqqani added that Afghanistan may lack long-range missiles or heavy weapons but has “strong resolve and determination in the battle against aggression.” Without naming Pakistan, he accused some nations of violating the sovereignty of others “to preserve their interests.” “Afghans have proved themselves in the battlefield,” he warned. “If our patience is tested again, our response will be very crushing,” he said, as per TOLOnews.His comments came soon after Turkey announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to uphold a ceasefire following days of tense talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar. The ceasefire deal, confirmed on Thursday, aims to prevent further border clashes that have recently left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.

NEW DELHI: Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said she lives freely in New Delhi, and “would love to go home” but remains cautious, given her family’s violent past.“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” Hasina told Reuters in her first media engagement after her dramatic fall from power last year.The 78-year-old Awami League chief fled to India in August 2024 after a deadly student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule. An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has ruled Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has promised to hold elections in February 2026.Sitting in the Indian capital, Hasina said she won’t return to Bangladesh under any government formed through elections that exclude her party.Hasina further warned that millions of Awami League supporters would boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls.“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” she said in emailed responses to Reuters.“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works,” she added.Once praised for transforming Bangladesh’s economy, Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity over a brutal crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.A verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal is expected on November 13, Reuters reported.A United Nations report estimates that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands more injured, mostly by security forces’ gunfire, during the unrest between July 15 and August 5, marking Bangladesh’s deadliest violence since the 1971 war of independence.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” Hasina said, denying the allegations. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself,” she added.Despite her exile, Hasina remains hopeful about her party’s future.“It’s really not about me or my family,” she said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.”",Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she lives freely in New Delhi.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

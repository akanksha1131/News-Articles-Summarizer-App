China pushing to deploy its own security staff to protect citizens in Pak: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-pushing-to-deploy-its-own-security-staff-to-protect-citizens-in-pak-report/articleshow/115235966.cms,"File photo

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

Trump’s 'Manhattan Project' of government reform: Musk and Ramaswamy to lead efficiency crusade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-manhattan-project-of-government-reform-musk-and-ramaswamy-to-lead-efficiency-crusade/articleshow/115236359.cms,"The 'Manhattan Project' parallel

Navigating the challenges

The DOGE Directive: Redefining efficiency

A moment of reinvention

In a move described by President-elect Donald Trump as “potentially 'The Manhattan Project ' of our time,” the soon-to-be President has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE . The acronym, a playful nod to Musk’s affinity for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, underscores the duo’s mission: dismantling bureaucracy, slashing excessive regulations, and transforming the vast apparatus of federal governance into a streamlined model of efficiency.The choice of leaders, both prominent figures in the private sector, reflects Trump’s long-standing ambition to draw on the expertise of outsiders to enact deep, systemic reforms. Tesla CEO Musk, known for his innovation in electric vehicles and space exploration, joins Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur turned political firebrand, to embark on this ambitious undertaking. Their combined vision is expected to resonate far beyond Washington, introducing an “entrepreneurial approach” never before seen in government circles.Musk, the world's wealthiest person, emerged as a crucial ally to Trump during the campaign, reportedly contributing over $100 million to support the Republican's bid and frequently promoting Trump's candidacy on X, the social media platform he owns.During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy, 39, was notably hesitant to criticize Trump, instead aligning himself closely with the Republican leader and championing many of the same policies, such as reducing the size of the federal government and reevaluating the country’s foreign alliances. Although Trump ruled out Ramaswamy as a potential running mate, he expressed an early interest in considering him for a Cabinet role, noting during an October campaign rally, “We can put him in charge of one of these big monsters, and he’ll do a better job than anybody you can think of.”Read more: Trump says Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy will lead department of government efficiency Trump’s characterization of DOGE as the “Manhattan Project” evokes one of the most significant endeavors of the 20th century: the clandestine World War II initiative that developed the atomic bomb. The original Manhattan Project was marked by its blend of military urgency, scientific ingenuity, and sweeping collaboration among the brightest minds of its era. It changed the course of global conflict and demonstrated the profound capabilities of American innovation when pushed to the limit.In the context of Trump’s announcement, the comparison speaks to the scale and transformative potential he envisions for government reform. Just as the original project redefined power on the global stage, DOGE aspires to redefine the US government's relationship with its citizens by eliminating inefficiencies and fostering a more responsive, accountable administration. Whether the audacious vision of Musk and Ramaswamy will match the historical weight of its namesake remains an open question, but the ambition is unmistakable.Despite its lofty goals, the path for DOGE is uncharted and fraught with regulatory and ethical considerations. Unlike official government agencies, the external advisory nature of DOGE could potentially sidestep typical disclosure requirements. Both Musk and Ramaswamy’s positions, operating outside the formal government employment structure, exempt them from divesting holdings or facing the same transparency obligations as federal employees. This raises questions about how DOGE will balance influence with accountability in its pursuit of governmental “shockwaves.”Trump’s directive sets a clear deadline: July 4, 2026. The symbolic timeline coincides with the nation’s 250th anniversary, positioning DOGE’s success as a patriotic milestone. The duo’s work will be aligned with the Office of Management and Budget, leveraging private-sector expertise to seek out inefficiencies in the $6.5 trillion annual federal spending. As Musk once boldly claimed he could uncover over $2 trillion in savings, the stakes and expectations for the new department are monumental.DOGE’s implementation strategy, its impact on existing agencies, and its reception by career bureaucrats will be closely watched. Skeptics point out that prior reform efforts have struggled against entrenched interests and systemic inertia, but proponents argue that DOGE’s external structure may enable it to bypass traditional roadblocks.Whether DOGE can replicate the transformative spirit of its World War II namesake, the Manhattan Project, remains to be seen. Yet in its essence, this initiative represents Trump’s ambition to leverage the icons of innovation and disruptive thinking to reshape governance itself. As July 2026 looms, Musk and Ramaswamy’s performance will be judged not just by the reforms they propose but by their ability to deliver a government that embodies Trump’s vision of “We the People” in efficiency and accountability.(With inputs from agencies)","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

This role placed him in charge of all US spy agencies, a time marked by the coronavirus pandemic and attempts to interfere with the 2020 election.Ratcliffe's time as Director of National Intelligence was not without controversy. He publicly accused Iran of attempting to intimidate US voters through emails. Additionally, he faced criticism for declassifying Russian intelligence that alleged damaging information about Democrats in the 2016 election. This move was condemned by Democrats who called it a partisan tactic.Before his role in intelligence, Ratcliffe served as a congressman starting in 2014. He gained attention as a strong supporter of Trump, especially during the first impeachment proceedings. Ratcliffe called the proceedings ""the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen,"" following the House's vote to impeach Trump.Ratcliffe's initial nomination for Director of National Intelligence in 2019 faced challenges. He withdrew after only five days amidst questions regarding his experience and qualifications. However, Trump nominated him again in February 2020, and he was confirmed by a divided Senate in May 2020.His new position as CIA Director will require Senate confirmation.","John Ratcliffe was the Director of National Intelligence in the final months of President Donald Trump's first term.

Legal and public reactions

“Severe blow” to accountability

The judge presiding over Donald Trump’s New York criminal case has postponed a crucial decision on whether to dismiss the former president-elect’s conviction until November 19. Trump’s legal team is seeking dismissal based on a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, arguing it shields Trump from prosecution for official acts committed during his presidency. The court’s conservative majority ruled 6-3, affirming broad immunity for presidents, a decision Trump’s attorneys swiftly invoked.The charges stem from Trump’s May conviction on 34 felony counts, with a jury finding he had falsified business records to conceal an alleged affair with a porn star before the 2016 election. He is scheduled for sentencing on November 26, unless Judge Juan Merchan dismisses the case based on the new immunity precedent.“The joint application for a stay of the current deadlines... until November 19, is granted,” read an email from the court, obtained by AFP.If Merchan dismisses the case, Trump, 78, would avoid sentencing entirely. If not, Trump’s attorneys are expected to argue against any immediate sentencing, warning it could hinder Trump’s responsibilities as president-elect.Public opinion has been polarized. The Kansas City Star editorial board urged the court to consider an unprecedented move: “do what was once unthinkable—force a president-elect to take the oath of office in a jail cell.” Such a scenario, it argued, would symbolize America’s commitment to the rule of law.However, Trump’s former attorney general, Bill Barr, criticized the New York case and others nationwide as “plainly brought for political purposes.” Barr argued that any continued pursuit of these cases would “distract the country and the incoming administration from the task at hand.”Trump himself has repeatedly condemned the prosecution as a “witch hunt,” declaring it “should be rightfully terminated.” In addition to the New York case, Trump faces two federal cases—one over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the other over alleged mishandling of classified documents. The special counsel handling both cases, Jack Smith, reportedly began winding down investigations following Trump’s election victory.Legal expert Randall Eliason expressed concern that Trump’s re-election could prevent him from facing consequences. “Trump’s victory means he is unlikely to be held accountable for any of his alleged criminal misconduct,” Eliason noted in an analysis on Substack, calling it “a severe blow to the ideal of the rule of law.”Trump’s legal saga adds another twist to an already dramatic election cycle, which saw Trump survive an assassination attempt in July, while President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, leading Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.","The judge presiding over Donald Trump's New York criminal case has postponed a crucial decision on whether to dismiss the former president-elect’s conviction until November 19. Trump's legal team is seeking dismissal based on a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, arguing it shields Trump from prosecution for official acts committed during his presidency.

He urged the Pakistan government to take immediate action to curb the worsening air pollution and protect these vulnerable populations.Fadil, in a statement, said, ""I am extremely concerned about the well-being of young children who are forced to breathe polluted, toxic air. Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight. We cannot afford to let our babies breathe toxic air. We cannot let the health, education, and well-being of millions of children suffer,"" he said.Calling on the government for immediate intervention, Fadil said that clean air is a fundamental right for every child, highlighting the urgency of protective measures to safeguard the health of Pakistan's youngest citizens amidst this crisis.Dawn reported that Punjab's Air Quality Index (AQI) has surged to critical levels, with seven districts, including Sialkot, registering AQI readings above 400 and one district reaching a staggering 774.In response to this escalating public health emergency, local authorities have temporarily closed schools until November 17. Residents are also being restricted from public parks, zoos, playgrounds, and museums to limit their exposure to the dangerous smog levels.The Unicef office in Islamabad highlighted that cities like Lahore and Multan are recording unprecedented levels of air pollution, with hospitals admitting numerous patients affected by the toxic air, including dozens of young children.","Unicef representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Front Line Defenders have condemned the arrest of human rights defender Idris Khattak, demanding his immediate release due to safety issues and deteriorating health .According to Front Line Defenders, Idris Khattak was abducted on November 13, 2019, and was later tried by the military court under the Official Secrets Act . In December 2021, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.In the 5 years of imprisonment, the human rights defender has gone through unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the jail.In a post on X, the Front Line Defenders stated, ""We urge Pakistani authorities to immediately end the persecution and incarceration of HRD Idris Khattak , especially given his age and underlying health concerns. Following his enforced disappearance , and 5 years of unjust imprisonment for his human rights work campaigning for religious and ethnic minorities , we call for his immediate and safe release to his family.""Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan. His activism has focused on defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, often in the face of systematic state repression.

Amid attempts to strike a balance in its relations with the US and China, Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over their attempts to increase their global influence. The tensions stem mainly from disagreements over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).While Pakistan has aligned itself with the US for military cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts, it relies heavily on China to address its financial woes. Islamabad has strengthened economic ties with Beijing through initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“Pakistan has the potential to serve as a bridge between China and the United States,” Pakistan ambassador to Washington Rizwan Saeed Sheikh was quoted as saying by state-run Radio Pakistan on Friday.The statement was made just hours after Pakistan’s foreign office declared on Thursday that Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election would not impact Pakistan’s ties with China. When questioned on the matter, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had responded, “Pakistan’s relations with China are all-weather. They are strategic and a source of stability in our foreign policy.”Baloch said Islamabad does not even need to consider the possibility that its relationship with China will be affected by any domestic development in another country.The intricate rivalry between the US and China affects Pakistan as it manages its strategic alliances with both powers while enduring a protracted economic crisis.“Our relations with the US are decades old, and we look forward to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US relationship in all fields,” Baloch said. “As the deputy PM (Ishaq Dar) said in a tweet yesterday, we look forward to fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the US.”During the Cold War, Pakistan and the US had developed close defence ties, but their relationship was also put to the test by different priorities on various issues.Relations between the two had soured in recent years as Washington accused Islamabad of aiding the Taliban in their 2021 takeover of Kabul, accusations that Islamabad denied. Tensions increased even more between the two countries when Pakistan’s jailed former PM Imran Khan accused the Biden administration of planning his removal through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April 2022, a claim denied by the US.","Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s interim govt said on Sunday that it would request an Interpol “red notice” alert to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity. They are accused of involvement in “killings and genocide” during the student-led uprising in July-Aug that led to Hasina’s ouster. “It will be done very soon,” law adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday.France-based Interpol publishes red notices at the request of a member nation, based on an arrest warrant issued in their home country. The Yunus-led administration has moved quickly to try the top Awami League functionaries, including Hasina and general secretary Obaidul Quader, by having arrest warrants issued against them through International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). A local court has ordered the authorities to arrest and present them before it by Nov 18. ICT chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said steps would be taken to bring Awami League to justice if the govt issues directives.The development came even as complaint of “genocide” and other crimes was filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against 62 individuals, including interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.The complaint was filed by former Sylhet mayor Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury. Other than Yunus and his advisers, Chowdhury also wants co-ordinators of the students’ uprising prosecuted. Chowdhury has alleged “genocide and crimes against humanity against Awami League’s leaders and activists, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and police in Bangladesh, all of whom were killed in the name of the students’ movement”. The complaint was lodged under Article 15 of ICC’s Rome Statute, which empowers individuals and others to send information on crimes within the court’s jurisdiction. Yunus’ law adviser Nazrul dismissed the plea as an attempt to mislead global opinion. “This is not a case. It is just a petition. Any person can do that,” he said.",Bangladesh's interim govt wants to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad.

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

"Bangladesh Hindus Rally: Hundreds march in Dhaka for protection of Hindus, minorities in Bangladesh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/hundreds-march-in-dhaka-for-protection-of-hindus-minorities-in-bangladesh/articleshow/114900125.cms,"Hundreds of demonstrators marched in Dhaka on Saturday, demanding protection for Hindus and other minorities who have experienced violence and threats following Sheikh Hasina 's removal from power in August.Rally organizers called on the interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities and ensure minimum minority representation in governance, along with additional requests.""It's deeply regrettable that the council of advisors does not acknowledge the suffering minorities have endured. I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

UK PM Climate Goals: UK PM unveils ambitious new climate goals even as top world leaders give COP29 a miss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-unveils-ambitious-new-climate-goals-even-as-top-world-leaders-give-cop29-a-miss/articleshow/115237063.cms,"UK PM unveils ambitious new climate goals even as top world leaders give COP29 a miss (Picture credit: Reuters)

BAKU: The two-day World Leaders Climate Action Summit at COP29 kicked off Tuesday with big names such as Joe Biden (USA), Narendra Modi (India), Xi Jinping (China), Vladimir Putin (Russia), and Emmanuel Macron (France) giving it a miss. The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, however, stole the show by announcing a higher climate goal for his country.Starmer pledged to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81 per cent by 2035 from the levels of 1990. His move of presenting the UK’s 2035 nationally determined contributions (NDC) — climate action targets — comes at a time when observers apprehend dilution of climate actions globally amid the US threat to withdraw from the Paris Agreement under US President-elect Donald Trump. It is believed that the UK’s new targets will galvanise the actions towards new NDCs, which are expected to be delivered by all countries next year.Though the summit is being organised by the COP29 presidency to give a political push to the two key agendas (new climate finance goals and carbon market), experts dismissed the non-participation of big leaders as a non-issue, saying the leaders knew that this year's agenda of the COP is more technical than political. Biden's absence is, however, obvious - an immediate fallout of the Democrats' defeat in the presidential poll.""The Heads of governments attending climate COPs in the very first few days is a recent trend. It is not mandatory. It started in 2021 when the commencement of the Paris Agreement just started and was needed to put it on a high pedestal. So, it depends really on the agenda and the need for advancing a specific goal. This year's agenda of the COP is more technical than political as it focuses on a financial goal where the shoe is on the other foot,"" said R R Rashmi, distinguished fellow, TERI.Rashmi, former India's negotiator, said, ""No major announcements except those relating to private sector involvement and carbon markets are expected. The ministers from all countries, including India, will join in any case in the second week when the negotiations are at full pace, and India is expected to have its high-level participation.""Climate activist and Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, Harjeet Singh, however, said the absence of high-level leaders from India and other nations at COP29 is indeed a missed opportunity to amplify political pressure on wealthy countries to fulfil their climate finance commitments.""Yet the real accountability lies with developed nations, who have continually fallen short on their pledges. Restoring trust in the multilateral system requires their renewed commitment—demonstrated through both presence and decisive action. India’s negotiating team remains resolute, championing equity and justice, ensuring that the voices of developing nations are front and centre, and advocating for the trillions of pounds needed annually to drive meaningful global climate action,"" he said.","The two-day World Leaders Climate Action Summit at COP29 kicked off Tuesday.

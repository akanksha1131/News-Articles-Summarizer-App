"President-elect Trump appoints Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff, marking historic first",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-2024-president-elect-trump-appoints-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff-marking-historic-first/articleshow/115066977.cms,"Who is Susie Wiles



Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race.

based in Florida, has managed several significant . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race. Wiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, the renowned football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the NFL for ten years and went on to announce 16 Super Bowls before his passing in 2013.

She worked alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, with orchestrating the most disciplined and sophisticated campaign of Trump’s three presidential runs.

Her previous successes also include steering Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and a brief leadership role in Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential bid.

During the 1970s, she served in New York Representative Jack Kemp's Washington office. Subsequently, she took positions in Ronald Reagan's campaign and worked as a scheduler in his White House.

Later, she relocated to Florida, where she provided counsel to two Jacksonville mayors and worked alongside Representative Tillie Fowler.

Her career progressed into Florida's competitive political landscape, where she earned recognition for helping businessman Rick Scott secure the governorship.

Wiles earned widespread recognition both within and beyond Trump's close circle for orchestrating his most organised and effective campaign to date.

As the frontrunner for the position, she maintained a low profile, declining to speak during Trump's victory celebration in the early hours of Wednesday.

She strategically avoided the formal campaign manager title, considering Trump's previous history of making frequent changes in that role.

President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday appointed Susie Wiles , one of the two key campaign managers behind his election victory, as White House chief of staff . Wiles will make history as the first woman to serve in this role.This appointment marks the first in a series of expected staffing announcements as Trump prepares for his return to the White House on January 20.The US Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed her selection. ""The 45th and 47th President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump announced today that Susan Summerall Wiles, the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump's highly successful 2024 Campaign for President, will be named President Trump's White House Chief of Staff,"" Vance wrote in a post on X.During the campaign, Wiles demonstrated exceptional ability in managing Trump's behaviour, achieving this through earned respect and demonstrating the benefits of following her guidance rather than disregarding it.""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,"" Trump said in a statement.""It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,” he added.Trump's staff recognised Wiles' unique ability to work with his temperament and decision-making style whilst maintaining his authentic approach.During campaign events, Trump frequently acknowledged Wiles' contributions, highlighting what others had described to him as his ""best-run campaign.""""She's incredible. Incredible,"" he said at a Milwaukee rally earlier this month.Trump's first administration saw four chiefs of staff, including one serving in an acting capacity for a year, reflecting significant staff turnover. Several senior advisers were cast out in his first term, either due to Trump's resistance to management or because of ideological conflicts within the divided West Wing.This appointment represents Trump's initial significant decision as president-elect, potentially setting the tone for his incoming administration as he assembles the team to oversee federal government operations. Despite limited federal government experience, Wiles maintains a strong working relationship with the president-elect.The chief of staff position is ""absolutely critical to an effective White House,"" according to Chris Whipple, author of the book ""The Gatekeepers"", which examines how this role influences presidencies.""At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” Whipple said.""On the plus side, she's shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that's really important. On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn't really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that's a real disadvantage,” he added.","Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns.

Katz expressed his commitment to overcome Israel's adversaries.A diplomatic tension with France marked Katz's final day as foreign minister, when Israeli authorities entered a French-owned religious facility in Jerusalem and temporarily held two gendarmes.This occurrence led French FOREIGN MInister Jean-Noel Barrot to cancel his planned visit to the Eleona church compound in east Jerusalem.During a joint appearance on Thursday, Barrot acknowledged Israel's right to self-defence whilst highlighting concerns about settlement activities, restrictions on humanitarian assistance, and ongoing aerial operations in northern Gaza.Netanyahu's decision to remove the defence minister during wartime faced criticism from opposition leaders across Israel's political divisions, triggering street demonstrations by thousands of citizens.Notable disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu centred on military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men.The dismissed minister had strongly supported military service for ultra-Orthodox Jews, whilst Netanyahu favoured maintaining their exemption, concerned that mandatory service might destabilise his far-right coalition government.","Israel's defence minister Israel Katz took his oath before parliament on Thursday.

Did Musk sign poll cheques to end checks on his clout?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-musk-sign-poll-cheques-to-end-checks-on-his-clout/articleshow/115066152.cms,"Even before Donald Trump was re-elected, his best-known backer, Elon Musk, had come to him with a request for his presidential transition. He wanted Trump to hire some employees from Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, as top govt officials - including at the defence department, according to two people briefed on the calls.That request, which would seed SpaceX employees into an agency that is one of its biggest customers, is a sign of the benefits that Musk may reap after investing more than $100 million in Trump's campaign, pushing out a near-constant stream of pro-Trump material on his social media platform, X, and making public appearances on the candidate's behalf across the hard-fought state of Pennsylvania.The outreach regarding the SpaceX employees, which hasn't been reported, shows the extent to which Musk wants to fill a potential Trump administration with his closest confidants even as his billions of dollars in govt contracts pose a conflict to any govt role. Musk and SpaceX and Tesla, his electric-vehicle company, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Trump's transition team also did not respond to a request for comment.The six companies that Musk oversees are deeply entangled with federal agencies. They make billions off contracts to launch rockets, build satellites and provide space-based communications services. Tesla makes hundreds of millions more from emissions-trading credits created by federal law. And Musk's companies are facing at least 20 recent probes, including one targeting a self-driving car technology that Tesla considers key to its future.Now, Musk will have the ear of the president, who oversees all of those agencies. Musk could even gain the power to oversee them himself, if Trump follows through on a promise to appoint him as head of a govt efficiency commission. Trump has told Musk that he wants him to bring the same scalpel to the govt that he brought to Twitter after he bought the company and rebranded it as X. Musk has spoken of cutting at least $2 trillion from the federal budget.The effect could be to remove, or weaken, one of the biggest checks on Musk's power: the federal govt.

Trump comes out with flying colours on diversity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-comes-out-with-flying-colours-on-diversity/articleshow/115066068.cms,"Republicans have sounded alarms for more than a decade about the limits of their overwhelmingly white party. To stay competitive for the White House, strategists warned, they would need to bring more black, Latino and other voters of colour into the fold.On Tuesday, Donald Trump showed how it could be done.His victory over vice-president Kamala Harris was decisive, broad and dependent on voters from core Democratic constituencies. Results showed that Trump continued his dominance with the white, working-class voters who first propelled his political rise. But he also made modest gains in the suburbs and cities, and with black voters, and even more significant inroads with Latinos.Trump's performance did not suddenly transform the Republican Party into the multiracial alliance of working-class voters that some strategists say is necessary for survival in the rapidly changing country. But he nudged it in that direction.At a time when the nation is sharply divided - particularly between rich and poor, and between those with and without a college degree - even incremental shifts were enough to sweep Trump back into power and put him on track to win the popular vote. Conservative strategists who have pushed the party to broaden its appeal pointed to the changes as proof of concept. Democrats, who have long relied on the support of minority voters, agonised over the trends. ""The losses among Latinos is nothing short of catastrophic for the party,"" said Rep. Ritchie Torres, an Afro-Latino Democrat whose district based in New York City's Bronx borough is heavily Hispanic. Torres worried that Democrats were increasingly captive to ""a college-educated far left that is in danger of causing us to fall out of touch with working-class voters.""There was evidence of Trump's inroads across the country. In the heavily blue-collar community of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh, Trump won nearly 70% of the vote, expanding his margins by about 5 percentage points since 2020. Nationally, Hispanic-majority counties on average shifted toward Trump by 10 percentage points. His gains with black voters were less significant but still notable in smaller communities across Georgia. Hancock, Talbot and Jefferson counties, all majority-black counties with no more than 15,000 people, shifted toward Trump. Trump campaign celebrated a victory in Baldwin County, Georgia, where 42% of the population is black. Republicans had not won the county for decades.Asian-American voters, who make up the fastest-growing eligible electorate in the country, also appeared to have drifted away from Democrats, according to exit polls and unofficial returns. ""The strength of Trump's reach into the traditional Democratic coalition of voters of colour was stunning,"" said Daniel HoSang, a Yale professor who has written about the rise of right-wing political attitudes among minority groups.Working-class voters were once aligned behind Democrats, while the Republican Party catered to the upper-income and business interests. Trump made a point of shifting his policies to speak to these new Republican voters: He proposed eliminating the tax on tips. He said he would increase the number of tax deductions. He vowed to increase manufacturing jobs across the country. Many Latino voters were not turned off by Trump's hardline immigration policies. Polling showed that about one-third of Latino voters supported his policies for mass deportations of immigrants without legal status.The result was a far cry from the party's infamous ""autopsy"" report following Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012, which urged Republicans to adopt more compassionate immigration policies. Instead, HoSang said, the winning formula was much closer to what Steve Bannon, Trump's ex-chief strategist in the White House, has called ""inclusive nationalism.""","Trump's performance did not suddenly transform the Republican Party into the multiracial alliance of working-class voters.

The recent success of Republican Party and former President Donald Trump in the US elections is making waves in Canada, where right-wing leaders are challenging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's policies on immigration, climate change, and government spending.People's Party of Canada (PPC) leader Maxime Bernier has been one of Trudeau's loudest critics, calling for Canada to adopt a more conservative approach to avoid being ""outcompeted"" by the US.After Trump's victory, PPC chief Bernier issued a blistering critique of the Trudeau government.""Canada needs to cut government spending, cut taxes, cut excessive red tape, get rid of its costly and inefficient climate policy, abolish all its insane DEI programs, stop mass immigration, and create a business climate where workers, entrepreneurs, and investors can thrive. Or else we will be hopelessly outcompeted by the US, suffer a major brain drain, and see our standard of living drop,"" Bernier said.Bernier, a longtime critic of Trudeau’s immigration stance, has argued that high immigration levels contribute to rising gang-related violence in Canadian cities.He also condemned Trudeau and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre for their silence on violent incidents took place on November 3, involving supporters of the Khalistan separatist movement.""Not one of these cowards dares to even name the Khalistani Sikhs who are committing the violence. They're afraid to offend some voters, even though Khalistani supporters are a minority of Sikh Canadians. This complacency explains whyKhalistani extremism keeps growing in this country,"" he posted on X.When the Hindu Sabha Temple in Toronto was attacked earlier this month, Bernier was one of the few Canadian politicians to openly call out the perpetrators as Khalistani supporters. He had also targeted Trudeau and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh for not naming Khalistani elements.His firm stance on the matter has garnered praise from Canadian Hindu organisations, with the Hindu Forum Canada recently lauding Bernier for his willingness to confront extremism, even at political risk.""The silence of other leaders, who prioritise voter appeal over public safety, continues to enable the growth of radical ideologies that endanger our communities,"" the Hindu Forum Canada said in a statement.""As Canadians, we deserve leaders who denounce violence and hate without hesitation. Our votes should reflect values of justice, accountability, and a commitment to peace.""As the pressure builds, Trudeau’s political future faces uncertainty, especially with the opposition currently leading in projections for the 2025 federal election.","People's Party of Canada (PPC) leader Maxime Bernier has been one of Trudeau's loudest critics.

What went wrong?

Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign ended with over $20 million in debt, highlighting financial strain following high spending and an aggressive ad strategy. Christopher Cadelago, California bureau chief for Politico, posted on X that Harris’s campaign ""ended with at least $20 million in debt,"" according to two sources familiar with the matter.This debt surfaced in the campaign’s final week, with Breitbart News noting that insiders attributed it partly to campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon’s decisions on high-profile concerts and intense ad campaigns.Harris's campaign reportedly attracted significant donations, raising over $1 billion, with $118 million still available as of mid-October. However, spending spiraled, leaving the campaign scrambling to address the deficit. “Jen [O’Malley Dillon] blew through a billion dollars in a few months,"" a campaign staffer told Breitbart News. Concerts featuring stars like Katy Perry, Lizzo, Eminem, and Bruce Springsteen were intended to energize young voters but proved costly.Despite massive spending, Harris’s team and Democratic allies channeled around $1.4 billion into political ads, outspending Trump and his allies by nearly $460 million, reported Fox Business. Yet, the spending didn’t secure key swing states, ultimately giving Trump an edge in a close race in Wisconsin.Data from AdImpact, an analytics firm, shows Harris’s focus on battleground states—Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, and Michigan—which absorbed nearly 80% of her ad spending. But outspending opponents in these states didn’t translate into wins; Trump’s narrow victories highlighted a gap between spending and voter influence.In Pennsylvania, for example, Harris outspent Trump by $261.9 million, yet Republicans held strong. Tax policy was the most discussed campaign issue, with Harris’s ads dominating airwaves on this topic—but it’s unclear if her messages connected with key voters.The breakdown of spending raises questions about the effectiveness of Harris’s strategy. Some critics point to a focus on star-studded events that failed to boost voter support. While the goal was to build excitement across a wide audience, some argue this approach led to financial strain without significant voter gains.Harris’s loss—and the resulting debt—may lead to a rethinking within the Democratic Party on campaign spending priorities, especially as Republicans achieved a historic win with fewer financial resources.","Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign ended with over $20 million in debt, highlighting financial strain following high spending and an aggressive ad strategy.

A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style.The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance , who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis . Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”Wiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event.Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Daughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign.However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.Wiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Wiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.","US President-elect Donald Trump appoints Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden urged Americans Thursday to lower the political temperature after Donald Trump's crushing election win over Kamala Harris, saying in a conciliatory address to the nation that he would ensure a peaceful transition of power .In a solemn speech from the White House, Biden also said the result should ""lay to rest"" doubts about the integrity of the US election system fuelled by Trump's refusal to acknowledge his own 2020 defeat by the Democrat. ""Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, is see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature,"" Biden said.Staff rose to their feet, cheered and clapped as Biden arrived in the famed Rose Garden. The 81-year-old dropped out of the race against Trump in July and handed the Democratic nomination to Harris, his vice-president. Biden said he had called Trump to congratulate him and assure him there would be a ""peaceful and orderly"" transition. Trump had refused to attend Biden's inauguration in 2021.The outgoing president also urged supporters not to lose hope after the re-election of Trump, who is likely to dismantle many of Biden's policies. ""Setbacks are unavoidable. Giving up is unforgivable. Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated,"" he said.Biden's comments were in stark contrast to billionaire Trump, whose election defeat denial four years ago culminated in the violent Jan 6, 2021 assault by Trump's supporters on the US Capitol.Biden has invited Trump to meet at the White House, for what would be their first encounter since Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June that forced him out of the race.","US President Joe Biden urges Americans to lower the political temperature after Donald Trump's crushing election win.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the election result which saw Democrats decimated was partly the result of ""global headwinds"" that are going against all incumbent leaders around the world. “Despite all of the accomplishments that we were able to get done, there were global headwinds because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Jean-Pierre said.“And it had a political toll on many incumbents. If you look at what happened in 2024 globally. And that’s part of what you saw,” she added.Karine who faced many a heated press conference when Joe Biden was still in the race over Biden's health was asked whether Biden felt any responsibility for Harris' loss to Donald Trump or whether he regrets opting out of the race.Biden “believes he made the right decision when he decided to step aside,” Karine said without answering to the question of whether Biden felt any responsibility towards Harris' loss.“There’s going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud of what he’s been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed with what the vice president was able to do,” Jean-Pierre said.Before the White House briefing, Joe Biden made his first address in which he said he accepts President-elect Donald Trump's victory and vowed to honor the Constitution with a peaceful transfer of power, even as he acknowledged the pain felt by his supporters.""I know for some people, it's a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss, campaigns or contests of competing visions,"" he said from the Rose Garden at the White House. ""The country chooses one or the other.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

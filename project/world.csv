(AP)

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law ratifying a strategic partnership treaty with North Korea, which includes a mutual defence agreement. The decree, published on Saturday, follows the summit between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang this June. The treaty, which has now passed through Russia's parliamentary process, promises that both countries will provide military assistance to each other in the event of an armed attack.The treaty’s ratification strengthens the relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Reports from both South Korea and Western intelligence suggest that North Korea has already supplied Russia with arms, with Ukrainian investigators claiming to have found evidence of North Korean weaponry at sites hit by Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed reports that North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia, with around 11,000 troops reportedly sent to the southern Kursk region. These troops have allegedly been involved in combat with Ukrainian forces, though Russia has not publicly acknowledged their presence. South Korea’s Ministry of Defence has similarly stated that approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers are now stationed in Russia, some of whom have been deployed to frontline areas.The treaty, which was ratified by both houses of the Russian parliament, pledges that if either country is attacked, the other will provide all necessary military and other assistance, in line with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which permits collective self-defence.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military faces increasing challenges as Russian forces advance in key areas, particularly around the Donetsk region, where they have captured multiple villages. Ukrainian commanders have warned that North Korean troops may soon join Russian forces in the ongoing offensive.The United States has expressed concern over the growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, with US secretary of state Antony Blinken confirming the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russian battlefields. In response, President Zelenskyy has called for enhanced air defence systems from European allies to counter the mounting threat.",Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a strategic partnership treaty with North Korea.

According to Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, Lahore’s AQI rose to 760, while Multan reached a staggering 1,914, making it one of the most polluted cities worldwide.The extreme pollution has left authorities scrambling to control the smog, with limited success reported.Lahore, under a thick blanket of smog for days, has witnessed widespread road closures due to low visibility, leading to multiple accidents. A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

Several monitors across Multan, including those at the WWF-Pakistan Office, Shamsabad Colony, and Multan Cantonment, showed AQI levels as high as 2,316, 1,635, and 1,527 respectively.Authorities in Pakistan have attributed the worsening air quality in Lahore to cross-border winds carrying pollutants from neighboring India, alleging that these winds have pushed smog levels to ""dangerous"" extremes.","Pakistan's Air Quality Index (AQI) has soared to unprecedented levels, sparking alarm across Punjab province.

Kamala Harris Future Presidency: Can Kamala Harris still become US President?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-kamala-harris-still-become-us-president/articleshow/115086886.cms,"2028?

Line of Succession





Building a Broad-Based Coalition



Addressing and Overcoming Campaign Challenges



Kamala Harris’s role as the first woman, Black, and South Asian American Vice President was a monumental step in US history. Despite her groundbreaking 2024 campaign, Harris faced a narrow defeat. In her concession, she reiterated her commitment to the nation’s future, saying that America faced a choice between two divergent paths—one rooted in the past and another focused on forward progress.Looking to the future, Harris has various potential pathways to reach the presidency. From leveraging her current political experience to running again in future elections, she remains a significant figure in the Democratic Party with the potential to shape American politics.Harris could channel her experience from the 2024 campaign into another presidential bid in 2028 or later. Her tenure as Vice President and as a former presidential candidate has provided her with a comprehensive understanding of the national landscape. By building on her political foundation and addressing lessons learned from her previous campaign, Harris could strengthen her appeal to voters. Establishing a broad coalition within the party and the electorate would be crucial to reintroducing her vision for the country.As Vice President, Harris remains first in line for presidential succession. Should President Biden be unable to serve due to health or unforeseen circumstances, Harris would assume the presidency. This would allow her to govern as President and potentially position her as an incumbent for the next election, presenting a new opportunity to earn the role in her own right.Regardless of her position, Harris can continue to have a lasting impact on American politics. By focusing on critical national issues—such as voting rights, criminal justice reform, and healthcare—she can reinforce her leadership reputation. Demonstrating effectiveness on these fronts could solidify her appeal both within the Democratic Party and among the general public, providing a foundation for future presidential aspirations.Harris’s diverse background and extensive political experience enable her to foster connections across a wide range of demographic groups and political ideologies. Engaging with grassroots organisations, community leaders, and other policymakers can help her build a strong base of support. This approach would not only bolster her political network but also ensure her policy initiatives resonate with a broad spectrum of voters.Reflecting on the 2024 campaign experience, Harris can identify areas for refinement, such as voter outreach and communication strategies. By addressing these challenges directly, she can strengthen her future campaign efforts. Her resilience and adaptability in the face of political setbacks can appeal to voters who value commitment and tenacity. Demonstrating a willingness to evolve and improve can further boost her standing within the electorate.Although Kamala Harris did not achieve the presidency in 2024, her political journey is far from over. She was the first female VP and the first Black-Indian woman to run for POTUS.Through strategic public service, coalition-building, and the application of lessons learned, she could still chart a course toward future success. Harris’s story highlights the power of resilience in the face of setbacks, offering inspiration for those committed to progress in American politics. Her path ahead is a testament to her tenacity and her potential to make history once more.","Kamala Harris was the first woman, Black, and South Asian American Vice President.

Who is Susie Wiles?



A Disciplined Campaign Leader



Roots in Party Establishment



Working with Trump’s Rivals



The 'Ice Maiden'



Reince Priebus (January 20, 2017 – July 31, 2017):

John F. Kelly (July 31, 2017 – January 2, 2019)

Mick Mulvaney (Acting, January 2, 2019 – March 31, 2020):

Mark Meadows (March 31, 2020 – January 20, 2021):

In a swift move following his win over Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles , his campaign chief, as White House Chief of Staff. Wiles, a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery, will now oversee daily White House operations , marking a new chapter in her long political career.Following his victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as his White House Chief of Staff. This marks Trump’s first major appointment post-election. Here’s a closer look at key facts about Wiles, who will be overseeing daily operations at the White House.A seasoned Republican strategist, Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, is credited with leading one of Trump’s most structured and disciplined campaigns. While it wasn’t always possible to keep Trump on-script, she managed to minimise leaks, crafted an effective strategy to appeal to Latino and Black voters, and ultimately helped secure a decisive win.Wiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Her experience includes roles with figures like Jack Kemp, a free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, known for moderate positions on issues like gun control. She also managed Jon Huntsman Jr.’s 2012 presidential campaign, supporting a candidate known for his moderate stance and criticism of Trump following the Capitol attack on January 6th.In later years, Wiles collaborated with several high-profile Republicans, including Trump ally Senator Rick Scott. She played a key role in Ron DeSantis’s successful 2018 campaign for Florida governor but was later dismissed by DeSantis after his election. When DeSantis entered the Republican primary against Trump, Wiles spearheaded an assertive strategy that highlighted DeSantis’s perceived weaknesses.Known for her restrained and enigmatic demeanour, Wiles rarely appears in televised interviews or public speaking events, contrasting with the more vocal Chris LaCivita. Trump even referred to her as the ""ice maiden"" during his victory speech, acknowledging her disciplined and sometimes ruthless approach to campaign management.Here’s a look at Trump’s former Chiefs of Staff and their perspectives on his leadership:Trump’s first Chief of Staff, Priebus maintained a low profile after his tenure, offering little public commentary on Trump’s style or approach to governing.: A former Marine Corps General, Kelly has been openly critical, describing Trump in stark terms and voicing concerns about how he might govern if given another term.Mulvaney has presented a balanced view, acknowledging both positives and negatives in Trump’s administration. While he has expressed concerns about certain decisions, he has been more reserved in his criticism than some other former officials.Meadows has remained a strong ally of Trump, consistently supporting his actions both during and after his presidency. Despite facing scrutiny over his involvement in January 6-related events, Meadows continues to align with Trump’s political direction.","Susie Wiles is a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery.

Vivian Jenna Wilson's fresh rant against estranged father Elon Musk.

As Elon Musk reacted to a news story of his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson deciding to leave the US seeing no future in the second Trump administration -- his father is a part of that -- Vivian unleashed a scathing attack on her father and called him a delusional, grubby, little control freak who hasn't matured for 38 years.Elon Musk wrote ""the woke mind virus killed my son"" to a user who claimed Vivian is not Elon Musk's daughter but son. Wilson saw the post and went on a rant on Threads.""If I'm correct, the reason why this particular post is the one that got to you is that you're mad that you finally don't have power over someone. You're upset because at the end of the day everyone around you knows you as a delusional and grubby little control freak who hasn't matured as a person for 38 years. However, last time I checked that's not my fucking problem,"" Wilson said.""So, you're still going with the sob-story about how ""woe is me, my child was infected by something-or-other and that's totally the only reason why they hate me. Just don't... please don't look into it, god forbid I'm anything but the victim in every scenario imaginable 😢 "". ""Did anyone ever actually believe this?

Wilson was named Xavier before she came out as a transgender and changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson. She said she did not want to have any ties with Elon Musk and Musk blamed the 'woke mind virus' for changing his son to a transgender. Musk said Xavier was born gay and autistic, a claim which Wilson dismissed as a lie.Wilson came to the news after she said she, as a transgender, has no future in the US. It was ironic as Elon Musk played a crucial role in Donald Trump's win and was there at Trump family photo with his four-year-old son X.","Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk's estranged daughter, is leaving the US.

The Harris-Walz campaign, which reportedly raised over $1 billion, is currently $20 million in debt, according to Politico.In a post on X, Trump extended what he called an offer “in the name of unity,” urging his party to support the Democrats through this “difficult period.” Trump’s message carried a hint of irony as he wrote, ""I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 (sic) Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn’t have lots of $’s left over. Now they are being squeezed by vendors and others. Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do.""Trump attributed his campaign’s financial surplus to ""earned media,"" or free media coverage, which he said was the “biggest asset” of his campaign as it “doesn’t cost very much.” Earned media includes viral social media posts, rallies, and interviews that generate attention without added expenses.Meanwhile, the financial strategy of the Harris-Walz campaign has come under scrutiny. The Washington Examiner reported that the campaign spent six figures to create a set for Harris’s October appearance on the popular podcast Call Her Daddy. Despite the expense, the episode failed to reach an audience of 1 million, drawing only 822,000 views, a stark contrast to Trump’s appearance on Joe Rogan’s show, which amassed over 47 million views.Several Democratic insiders have expressed frustration over the campaign’s management. Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraiser Lindy Li called the campaign’s result “an epic disaster.” Speaking on Fox & Friends Weekend, Li said, ""The truth is, this is just an epic disaster. This is a $1 billion disaster.""Li noted that she and other fundraisers had sought donations based on the belief that the election would be close. “I raised millions of that. I have friends that I have to be accountable to and to explain what happened because I told them it was a margin of error race. I was promised, [Harris campaign chair] Jen O’Malley Dillon promised all of us that Harris would win. She even put videos out that Harris would win. I believed her, my donors believed her. And so they wrote massive checks.""","President-elect Donald Trump offered to help pay off the debts of the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

"Trump's potential pardon list: Capitol rioters, high-profile convictions among controversial cases on the table",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-potential-pardon-list-capitol-rioters-high-profile-convictions-among-controversial-cases-on-the-table/articleshow/115131620.cms,"As President-elect Donald Trump makes his way to the Oval Office after sweeping the US presidential elections, American political analysts have begun discussing the likelihood of him granting pardons to various individuals as indicated by him during his campaign.

According to the US Department of Justice, the President's clemency power is conferred by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States. It states that the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”

Here are some of those Trump might pardon in his second term:

January 6 Capitol rioters

Ross Ulbricht

Hunter Biden

Peter Navarro

Julian Assange

Donald Trump during his campaign has repeatedly expressed his intention to pardon those involved in the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. “if they’re innocent, I would pardon them,” Trump told reported in July while his campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that that decisions would be made individually.The impact of these statements is already evident in legal proceedings. A Washington DC judge recently rejected Christopher Carnell's hearing postponement request, which cited Trump's clemency promises. Additionally, legal representative John Pierce, who acts for January 6 defendants, confirmed to NPR their intention to pursue pardons for all clients.Supporters of Ross Ulbricht, who received a life sentence in 2015 for establishing the Silk Road dark web marketplace, announced on Friday ""Ross is coming home in January."" This follows Trump's commitment at the Libertarian National Convention in May to reduce Ulbricht's sentence on his first day in office.Trump also indicated that he would pardon President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, who faces sentencing in December for federal tax and firearms violations. In conversation with Hugh Hewitt, Trump said ""I wouldn't take it off the books .despite what they've done to me.""Donald Trump gave hints that he might pardon his former trade adviser Peter Navarro, who completed a four-month prison term this year for defying a House January 6 Committee subpoena. After casting his vote in Florida on Tuesday, Trump praised Navarro as ""a good man"" who faced unfair treatment and called him a ""great patriot"" when questioned about a potential pardon.Despite this possibility, Navarro expressed to the Wall Street Journal in May that he would decline any pardon from Trump. His said that he will continue challenging his conviction. ""I will not give the Supreme Court any excuse to duck what is otherwise a landmark constitutional case,"" he wrote in a letter sent from prison.Trump mentioned in a May interview with podcaster Tim Pool that he would ""give very serious consideration"" to pardoning WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange, who reached an agreement with American authorities in June to admit guilt for publishing military secrets, could secure his freedom after spending 12 years in the UK, partially in prison, while contesting US extradition efforts.Meanwhile, the constitutional implications of Trump pardoning himself remain ambiguous, as he is the first elected president with a criminal conviction. In a previous NBC News interview before his Manhattan hush money conviction, Trump said it was ""very unlikely"" he would pardon himself.Constitutional scholars also remain divided on this. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, highlighted in a 2018 USA Today piece that Article II, Section 2 lacks specific restrictions on pardon recipients, potentially allowing presidential self-pardons. Additionally, legal experts Laurence Tribe, Richard Painter and Norman Eisen argued in the Washington Post that such power would be illogical, given constitutional limitations on pardons regarding impeachment.Earlier, during his presidency, Trump granted 143 pardons and 94 commutations, ranking among the lowest in presidential clemency actions alongside George W Bush and George HW Bush, as per Pew Research. His pardons drew scrutiny for favouring associates from his 2016 campaign, including Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor.However, presidential pardons do not completely remove criminal records. Post-pardon, individuals might continue to face certain limitations, including restrictions on voting rights in particular states.","President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to pardon those involved in the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. The President's clemency power is conferred by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States. The constitutional implications of Trump pardoning himself remain ambiguous, as he is the first elected president with a criminal conviction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115132430,imgsize-388794,width-400,resizemode-4/115132430.jpg"

HBO's 'Real Time' host Bill Maher on Friday said that Americans had more than enough time to get to know vice president Kamala Harris , and they 'didn't like' her, disagreeing with journalists who excused Harris' loss to President-elect Donald Trump During Friday's 'Overtime' segment, ABC News contributor Sarah Isgur argued that Democrats put Harris in a difficult position by asking her to run a 'three-month campaign' while she was supposed to introduce herself to the American people.

Hillbilly-Telugu Love Story: How JD Vance made Usha fall in love with him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hillbilly-telugu-love-story-how-jd-vance-made-usha-fall-in-love-with-him/articleshow/115123732.cms,"Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.

JD Vance ’s love story with Usha Chilukuri is one of contrasts meeting in harmony—a “veg meets non-veg” dynamic rooted in their different upbringings. Vance, whose challenging childhood in Ohio exposed him to family struggles and economic hardship, contrasts sharply with Usha's structured, achievement-oriented upbringing in California, the daughter of Indian immigrants focused on academic success and cultural heritage.Their paths converged at Yale Law School , where an initial friendship blossomed into love. In, Vance recalls being overwhelmed by his feelings for Usha, recounting how friends noticed his lovesickness. Once discovering that Usha was single, he took the plunge, initiating a relationship that would transform his life.Despite their differing backgrounds, the couple navigated cultural and personal challenges together. Vance has shared incidents where Usha's patience and resilience grounded him, especially during moments when his temper flared. In one notable instance, after he stormed out following a disappointing interview, Usha’s calm but firm response taught him that running from problems was unacceptable.They married in 2014, and their intercultural relationship became a testament to mutual respect and understanding. Usha’s introduction of JD at the Republican National Convention highlighted the strength of their partnership, noting how he adapted to her vegetarian diet and even attempted Indian cuisine to connect with her family. Now, as Vance prepares to step into his new role as Vice President-elect, their bond continues to serve as a powerful foundation both in life and politics.In, J.D. Vance presents his wife, Usha Vance , as an essential and grounding presence in his life, guiding him through challenging moments and helping him navigate his journey from his turbulent upbringing in the Appalachian culture to a successful career as a lawyer. Usha, a Yale Law School classmate, not only provided support but also stood by Vance as he worked through his family struggles and personal challenges, fostering his resilience and growth. Their relationship is portrayed as an anchor, stabilising him and offering emotional clarity amid his struggles with identity, family, and career.Vance describes several formative experiences where Usha’s steadfast nature played a vital role in his transformation. One significant aspect of Usha's influence emerges during their early relationship. Vance admits to attempting to distance himself from her, feeling unsure and apprehensive about fully committing. However, Usha saw potential in him, refusing to let go easily. She showed a remarkable determination, telling him that breaking off the relationship was ""stupid unless [he] didn’t care about her."" This unwavering stance encouraged Vance to confront his fears, ultimately opening him to the possibilities of a stable, loving relationship—something he hadn’t often experienced within his family. Usha’s persistence in this period of his life was crucial in breaking down the barriers Vance had constructed around himself, which were deeply rooted in his tumultuous past.Usha’s patience and understanding were further demonstrated when Vance encountered setbacks during his time at Yale Law School. During a stressful period in his second year, the couple travelled to Washington, D.C., for follow-up interviews with several law firms. Vance, tense and anxious about his performance, became visibly frustrated when discussing his career prospects. Usha tried to comfort him, encouraging him by saying he had probably performed better than he realised and reminding him there would always be other opportunities if things didn’t go as planned. Despite her reassurances, Vance’s frustration boiled over, and he ""exploded,"" directing his inner turmoil outward. This reaction marked a critical moment in their relationship, revealing Vance’s deep-seated insecurities and highlighting Usha’s unwavering empathy and understanding.After this incident, Vance recounts a moment of reconciliation. He walked away to cool off and found Usha waiting for him on the steps of Ford’s Theatre, a gesture that symbolised her readiness to forgive and move forward. He apologised to her, acknowledging the weight of his struggles with family and personal expectations. Usha, who hadn’t learned to engage in the emotionally charged arguments common in Vance’s family, responded with calmness. Her approach contrasted with the combative style of his upbringing, where arguments often escalated into shouting and defensiveness. Through her response, Usha modelled a different, healthier way of handling conflict, encouraging Vance to adopt more constructive forms of communication.Usha’s influence on Vance extended beyond their immediate relationship and included her family, whose dynamics sharply contrasted with the chaos Vance had experienced in his own. Visiting her family for Thanksgiving, Vance was struck by the warmth and peacefulness that permeated their household. He marvelled at the way Usha’s mother never complained about her father behind his back, and how her parents spoke lovingly of their siblings and genuinely enjoyed their grandmother’s presence. For Vance, witnessing these relationships offered a glimpse of the familial stability he had longed for but rarely encountered. The harmony in Usha’s family served as an unspoken lesson in what healthy family dynamics could look like, providing a model for Vance to aspire to and reinforcing the value of emotional stability.Throughout the book, Vance reflects on Usha’s insights into his personality, capturing moments of gentle humour and candid observations. Early in their relationship, Usha likened Vance to a “turtle,” capturing his tendency to withdraw into himself when faced with challenges or emotional vulnerability. This playful analogy resonated with Vance, as he recognised his habit of retreating emotionally—a defence mechanism born from his tumultuous childhood. Usha’s ability to offer such observations with affection and without judgment strengthened their bond, allowing Vance to confront these traits with acceptance and work toward personal growth.In later years, Usha continued to be a vital support system for Vance, helping him transition into adulthood and navigate professional and personal pressures. One of the more serene images in the book describes a moment of contentment: Vance waking up at two in the morning, with Usha lying beside him and their dogs at the foot of the bed. This quiet moment of domestic stability symbolised a profound contrast to the chaos of his past. Vance describes how he looked forward to spending simple, peaceful days with Usha—going to work, taking the dogs to the park, and buying groceries together. These everyday activities, which he might have once taken for granted, were now infused with meaning and satisfaction, largely because of Usha’s presence and influence in his life.Usha also played a key role in Vance’s professional achievements. She provided unyielding support through his years at Yale, offering guidance that helped him navigate the unfamiliar academic environment and seize opportunities he might otherwise have missed. When they graduated, Vance’s “crew” included Usha and members of his family who came to celebrate the moment. Her influence, combined with her understanding of the academic and professional spheres, helped him to channel his ambitions productively.In, Usha Vance is portrayed as more than a supportive partner. She is a grounding force who helped J.D. Vance confront his past, inspiring him to pursue stability and growth both emotionally and professionally. Through her enduring patience, calm perspective, and steady encouragement, she exemplified the very qualities that Vance sought but had rarely encountered. Usha not only helped Vance navigate the challenges of law school and professional life but also provided a model of emotional resilience and family harmony, which enabled him to aspire to a life beyond the limitations imposed by his upbringing.","In, J.D.

UK government scrambles to repair damage to UK-US special relationship caused by Labour supporting Harris and tweets attacking Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uk-government-scrambles-to-repair-damage-to-uk-us-special-relationship-caused-by-labour-supporting-harris-and-tweets-attacking-trump/articleshow/115123828.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: Britain’s govt is scrambling to smooth over tensions in the UK-US special relationship after 100 Labour party staff flew to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris in the presidential election and old scathing comments surfaced from Labour frontbenchers heavily criticising the US president-elect.Donald Trump’s lawyers wrote to the Federal Election Commission last month requesting an investigation into foreign interference and alleging illegal foreign contributions by Labour to the Harris campaign.Starmer wrote on ‘X’ in 2019: “An endorsement from Donald Trump tells you everything you need to know about Boris Johnson’s politics and why he isn’t fit to be prime minister.”In a 2018 Time article UK foreign secretary David Lammy described Trump as a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”, a “tyrant” and a “profound threat to the international order”.In a 2019 tweet Lammy wrote: “Deluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic, Donald Trump is no friend of Britain. He is not fit to hold public office” and “Donald Trump lies more times a day than the average person goes to the bathroom.”Starmer tweeted to congratulate Trump on the day he won the election, as did Lammy, and Starmer rushed to phone Trump on Wednesday too.Insiders told Bloomberg that Trump has repeatedly told associates he thinks the UK’s new PM is “very left-wing” and Starmer’s policies have been heavily criticised on ‘X’ by Elon Musk in recent months.Sean Spicer, former White House press secretary, told ITV that Trump does not forget Lammy’s type of comments, but that he had seen the Labour govt try and “walk back those remarks” and with Trump there is “always negotiation”.Four years ago deputy PM Angela Rayner had described Trump as a “buffoon” who had “no place in the White House”.On Thursday she was quick to call up vice president-elect J D Vance, who during the election campaign had said: “Under Labour the UK could be the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon.”Rayner tweeted after the call it was good to speak to Vance. “We spoke about our plans for the future and how, working together, we will build on the special relationship between our great countries.”Questioned about his tirade of abuse at Trump on BBC Newscast, Lammy dismissed the tweets as “old news”.“In that period lots of things were said about Trump on Twitter. It was a daily occurrence. Now I am foreign secretary, I have had a meal with Donald Trump.” He said it never came up in their conversation, “not even vaguely”, and that he found him to be a “very gracious, generous host”.“What you say as a backbencher and what you do wearing the real duty of public office are two different things…” Lammy said.","Donald Trump’s lawyers wrote to the Federal Election Commission last month requesting an investigation into foreign interference. 100 Labour party staff flew to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

Vice president Kamala Harris ' campaign reportedly spent $1 million on TV host and producer Oprah Winfrey for hosting her rally and interview during the presidential election campaign.In September, Winfrey interviewed Harris at the ""Unite for America"" rally in Michigan, where Hollywood stars like Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep showed their support through virtual appearances, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers.According to a report from Fox News, citing The Washington Examiner, Harris ' campaign spent $15 million on ""event production,"" with $1 million allocated to Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions.The Washington Examiner reported that Harris' campaign dedicated substantial funds for media appearances and event production. One significant expenditure was a six-figure sum for a set used during Harris' appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. Hosted by Alex Cooper, the podcast covers topics like relationships and sex. Despite the investment, the interview has garnered just over 800,000 views on YouTube since its October release. In comparison, President-elect Trump’s appearance on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast has amassed over 47 million views.“Money can’t buy you love or a good candidate,” Republican strategist Brad Todd remarked to The Washington Examiner, as quoted by Fox News. He added, “Advertising is a pretty important source of information for swing voters...It no doubt matters, but it’s not enough.

"H-1B Visa: Amazon, Google and other American companies ramp up use reliance on H-1B visa holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-google-and-other-american-companies-ramp-up-use-reliance-on-h-1b-visa-holders/articleshow/115122666.cms,"In recent years, leading American tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta have significantly ramped up their reliance on H-1B visa holders, while India’s top IT firms have moved away from these visas, according to an analysis by ET.Since 2016, the use of H-1B visas by American firms has surged by 189%, with Amazon taking the lead at a remarkable 478% rise, followed by Meta (244%) and Google (137%). In contrast, major Indian IT firms , including TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and HCL, have reduced their dependency on H-1B visas by 56%.The increasing reliance on H-1B visa holders by US tech giants over the past eight years contrasts with the approach of India’s IT companies, which have been reducing their dependence, according to the Economic Times analysis. This shift reflects how Indian firms, having established strong operations in the US, are now actively recruiting American workers and offering Green Card sponsorships to experienced professionals.The heightened demand for H-1B visas among American companies is seen as a response to a need for specialised talent across digital transformation, cloud computing, and AI sectors, according to Vic Goel, managing partner at US-based corporate immigration law firm Goel & Anderson. Goel notes that “US companies must rely on H-1B visas to fill roles with skills not easily found domestically, especially in emerging tech.”Meanwhile, the recently elected President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration stance could affect the issuance of new H-1B visas, renewals of existing visas, and the work eligibility of H-4 visa holders (spouses of H-1B holders). Founders of Indian origin, such as Aravind Srinivas of the AI start-up Perplexity, have also raised concerns about the challenges associated with obtaining Green Cards, sparking further debate on immigration difficulties.Immigration experts anticipate that Trump’s return to office could lead to substantial changes in the Immigration and Nationality Act, particularly concerning H-1B visas. Some suggest that country-specific quotas might be introduced, potentially benefiting India due to its diplomatic relationship with the US. Rusell A. Stamets, a partner at Circle of Counsels in Delhi, advises that Indian businesses with significant US ties should proactively deepen their understanding of US policies to positively influence their outcomes.Regardless of policy adjustments, experts foresee rising costs in hiring foreign talent due to increases in visa fees and wage requirements for H-1B positions. Rajiv Dabhadkar, founder of the National Organisation for Software and Technology Professionals, points out, “The original aim of the H-1B visa programme was to help US employers find talent not locally available, but recent increases in fees and prevailing wages have underscored this intent.”During Trump’s previous term, H-1B visa applications faced heightened scrutiny, with 34% requiring additional documentation. This created uncertainty for applicants and potentially impacted family stability, particularly if spouses lose work rights. Poorvi Chothani, founder of the immigration law firm LawQuest, warns that “existing H-1B holders may face greater professional and personal instability if wages don’t meet high standards and if H-4 visa holders lose their work eligibility.”In response, India’s technology sector, through industry body Nasscom, has invested $1.1 billion towards STEM development in the US, forming partnerships with over 130 colleges and universities and upskilling 255,000 employees. This initiative has contributed to over 600,000 jobs in the US, both directly and indirectly, demonstrating India’s commitment to the US talent ecosystem despite changing visa policies.","Since 2016, the use of H-1B visas by American firms has surged by 189%.

A large wildfire erupted on Neversink Mountain in Reading, Pennsylvania, late Friday night, spreading rapidly and prompting evacuation orders for nearby residents, reported NBCPhiladelhphia.The fire, which started around 11:30 pm (local time), was visible from the iconic Reading Pagoda, with social media images showing a line of flames along the mountain. Approximately 100 homes are located in the vicinity of the blaze. Residents near South 18th and 19th Streets and Ganter Lane have been asked to evacuate to Amanda E. Stout Elementary School on South 10th Street.The Birdsboro Office of Emergency Management warned that this could be a prolonged incident, potentially lasting over a week due to the ongoing dry conditions.The Philadelphia region has not seen measurable rainfall for 41 days, worsening the risk of fires. Southeastern Pennsylvania has already experienced several large brush fires, leading to a burn ban and red flag warning. Officials cautioned that fires can start from nearly any source and spread rapidly due to the winds.Firefighters have faced difficulties containing the flames due to the dry, windy conditions and challenging terrain. However, by late Saturday morning, the winds began to die down, allowing crews to make progress.Authorities confirmed that the fire is not currently an immediate threat to homes, and evacuated residents have been allowed to return.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Front Line Defenders have condemned the arrest of human rights defender Idris Khattak, demanding his immediate release due to safety issues and deteriorating health .According to Front Line Defenders, Idris Khattak was abducted on November 13, 2019, and was later tried by the military court under the Official Secrets Act . In December 2021, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.In the 5 years of imprisonment, the human rights defender has gone through unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the jail.In a post on X, the Front Line Defenders stated, ""We urge Pakistani authorities to immediately end the persecution and incarceration of HRD Idris Khattak , especially given his age and underlying health concerns. Following his enforced disappearance , and 5 years of unjust imprisonment for his human rights work campaigning for religious and ethnic minorities , we call for his immediate and safe release to his family.""Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan. His activism has focused on defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, often in the face of systematic state repression. Khattak has been particularly vocal about abuses carried out by military and intelligence agencies, especially in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, which has experienced ongoing conflict and instability.United Nations human rights experts also lamented the conviction and said, ""Mr. Khattak's reported sentencing is an attack against the human rights community in Pakistan and sends a chilling message to civil society activists monitoring and reporting on alleged violations, committed by the military and security forces or with their consent or acquiescence, such as systematic or widespread enforced disappearances.""Pakistan is known for violating human rights by forcibly disappearing the activists and defenders.

Amid attempts to strike a balance in its relations with the US and China, Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over their attempts to increase their global influence. The tensions stem mainly from disagreements over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).While Pakistan has aligned itself with the US for military cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts, it relies heavily on China to address its financial woes. Islamabad has strengthened economic ties with Beijing through initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“Pakistan has the potential to serve as a bridge between China and the United States,” Pakistan ambassador to Washington Rizwan Saeed Sheikh was quoted as saying by state-run Radio Pakistan on Friday.The statement was made just hours after Pakistan’s foreign office declared on Thursday that Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election would not impact Pakistan’s ties with China. When questioned on the matter, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had responded, “Pakistan’s relations with China are all-weather. They are strategic and a source of stability in our foreign policy.”Baloch said Islamabad does not even need to consider the possibility that its relationship with China will be affected by any domestic development in another country.The intricate rivalry between the US and China affects Pakistan as it manages its strategic alliances with both powers while enduring a protracted economic crisis.“Our relations with the US are decades old, and we look forward to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US relationship in all fields,” Baloch said. “As the deputy PM (Ishaq Dar) said in a tweet yesterday, we look forward to fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the US.”During the Cold War, Pakistan and the US had developed close defence ties, but their relationship was also put to the test by different priorities on various issues.Relations between the two had soured in recent years as Washington accused Islamabad of aiding the Taliban in their 2021 takeover of Kabul, accusations that Islamabad denied. Tensions increased even more between the two countries when Pakistan’s jailed former PM Imran Khan accused the Biden administration of planning his removal through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April 2022, a claim denied by the US.","Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.

200 Bangladeshis abducted during Hasina regime still missing: Inquiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/200-bangladeshis-abducted-during-hasina-regime-still-missing-inquiry/articleshow/114977880.cms,"Protesters shout slogans as they vandalise a mural of Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina with paint and mud, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 3, 2024. (Reuters)

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

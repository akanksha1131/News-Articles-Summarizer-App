Witness describes scene of Pearl Street Mall attack

'I saw this big fire go up'



'There were people who were burning'







Eyewitnesses shared harrowing details of an attack in Colorado where a suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned six victims during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The FBI described the incident ""targeted terror attack.""Ed Victor, a participant in the Run For Their Lives' walk, explained that these silent marches have occurred weekly since the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, aiming to highlight the situation of hostages in Gaza. The group, comprising approximately 30 people that Sunday, regularly pauses at the courthouse to engage in songs, storytelling and recitation of hostages' names.According to Victor, while the marchers occasionally face verbal opposition, they maintain their peaceful procession along Pearl Street without responding. He noted that passersby often show support through applause, nods or expressions of gratitude. The possibility of a physical attack had never crossed his mind.""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side.And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" he told to CBS News.Victor described their efforts to extinguish the fire. while a marcher with medical expertise attended to the injured woman, Victor remained with her husband to provide support. He mentioned that volunteers quickly arrived with water to assist.""I saw the aftermath,"" said street performer Peter Irish. ""It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.""Another witness said that she noticed a disturbance near the courthouse while taking her lunch break on Pearl Street. Concerned about potential violence, she decided to investigate the situation.""I saw this big fire go up,"" Brooke Coffman informed NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver. She immediately contacted emergency services whilst moving towards the incident.She observed two women in their undergarments who had removed their burning attire, displaying severe burns on their legs. A third woman nearby, also with leg burns, was crying out in pain.Coffman became emotional whilst describing one of the women's appearances, noting that the flames had consumed her hair, making her face difficult to recognise.""It just wasn't a good scene,"" Coffman said.""I know it's Boulder, it's Pearl Street, some stuff happens ... but you just don't really think it's going to happen right here, you don't think it's something you're going to see, so many people hurt,"" Coffman said.Lynn Segal, 72, who was among the roughly 20 participants, described seeing a “rope of fire” shoot in front of her, followed by “two big flares.”“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” Segal said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”She shared that while she supports Palestine and was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt, she feared she might be mistaken as being connected to the attacker.The police have identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Solimanw. He as allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" while using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd, according to Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek.","Six people were burned during a march in support of Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado.

Elon Musk vs Cory Booker: A tale of two 'Nazi salutes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-vs-cory-booker-a-tale-of-two-nazi-salutes/articleshow/121560682.cms,"The Outrage Exchange Rate



When Satire Becomes News



Final Salute







“If it looks like a Nazi salute and smells like a Nazi salute, but one guy’s a tech billionaire and the other is a Democrat senator, only one of them ends up being banned in Berlin.”Welcome to yet another episode of Who Gets Cancelled Today?—where the rules are made up, the outrage is algorithmic, and consistency is strictly optional.Let’s set the stage.In January 2025, at Donald Trump’s second inauguration—a carnival of CPAC cosplay, Mar-a-Lago loyalists, and Liberty University dropouts—Elon Musk stepped on stage, placed his hand over his heart, and extended his arm outward with the ceremonial stiffness of a Leni Riefenstahl extra. Reuters confirms the gesture and backlash.Germany, where the Nazi salute is criminalised when used in ideological contexts, responded with moral indigestion and political outrage. Politicians demanded travel bans. German media erupted. The New York Times ran grim explainer columns. MSNBC activated their ""Rise of Fascism"" chyron package. (No, seriously, they have one.)The Anti-Defamation League, bless their diplomatically exhausted souls, tried to de-escalate: they called it “an awkward gesture made in a moment of enthusiasm.” But that didn't stop former ADL director Abraham Foxman from calling it exactly what it looked like: a Nazi salute.BBC and Haaretz captured the range of reactions.Musk, predictably, memed through the chaos. He dismissed the outrage as “dirty tricks” and said the “‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” His actual words on X/Twitter.Meanwhile, some far-right Telegram channels threw digital confetti.Fast forward to May 2025. Enter Senator Cory Booker—America’s favourite motivational speaker in a suit. At the California Democratic Convention, Booker made a gesture eerily similar: hand over heart, arm extended outward, open palm. Footage surfaced on social media.Cue: crickets.No Germany. No ADL. No CNN panels dissecting palm angles. No panicked Atlantic thinkpieces. Just a quick clarification from Booker’s spokesperson: “He was waving to the audience.” Case closed. Nothing to see here.Piers Morgan, ever the thundercloud of transatlantic outrage, noticed. He highlighted the double standard and triggered an X-storm.Elon the Meme Lord vs Cory the ChoirboyElon is the algorithm’s favourite villain: a ketamine-fuelled libertarian who co-signed Trump’s chaos and dropped $275 million to support the re-election campaign. He’s what happens when Reddit becomes sentient and buys a stake in SpaceX.So when Musk makes a vaguely Roman gesture? Of course it’s fascism. Throw in some AI-enhanced screenshots and a Daily Show segment, and suddenly it’s 1933 again.Cory Booker, on the other hand, is Progressive America’s wholesome avatar—the kind who quotes Rumi during climate speeches. His identical gesture? A heartwarming wave. If Elon had done it while holding a “Biden 2024” placard, Vox would’ve called it “a subversive reclaiming of classical Americana.”In this economy of curated outrage, Musk trades at Tesla volatility. Every blink is a Bitcoin crash. Booker? He’s a mutual fund of liberal goodwill. You’d need a Wagner soundtrack and SS cosplay before NPR considers it problematic.But here’s the rub: when the rules of moral outrage change depending on the party—or the palm—you can kiss public trust goodbye. Remember when the Left said “symbols matter”? Apparently not when it’s one of their own accidentally doing a salute straight out of Triumph of the Will: The Musical.There’s an old Dr Strangelove scene where the titular character can't stop his arm from flying up in a Nazi salute. That’s what this feels like. Except instead of satire, we now have real-life Democrats doing the salute, Republicans doing the same, and both sides frantically uploading context to cloud drives of morality.The media? Just a referee selectively enforcing the rules.So here’s your closing thought: if you’re going to raise your hand in American politics, make sure it’s the correct hand, with the correct party ID, at the correct convention—preferably surrounded by coastal elites and NPR donors. Otherwise, you might find yourself Photoshopped into history’s darkest moments and banned from Bavaria.Because in today’s reality-TV democracy, gestures are never just gestures. Unless, of course, they are.","Elon Musk and Cory Booker both performed the Nazi salute at Donald Trump's inauguration. Germany, where the salute is criminalised when used in ideological contexts, responded with moral indigestion and political outrage. But when the rules of moral outrage change depending on the party, you can kiss public trust goodbye.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121560727,imgsize-28588,width-400,resizemode-4/121560727.jpg"
Small plane crashes off Connecticut Coast; man and teen pulled out from water,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/small-plane-crashes-off-connecticut-coast-man-and-teen-pulled-out-from-water/articleshow/121560733.cms,"Representative image





A small plane carrying a 41-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl crashed into the Long Island Sound off the coast of Connecticut on Sunday morning, but both miraculously survived with only minor injuries, according to the New York Post.The six-seater Piper PA-32 went down near the Thimble Islands around 10.30 am, about ten minutes after taking off from Bridgeport.Before the crash, the pair made a desperate call for help and were directed to attempt an emergency landing at Tweed New Haven Airport. However, they were unable to make it in time.They were rescued when the Coast Guard Station New Haven sent a 45-foot response boat to the scene after the Sector Long Island Sound Command Center was alerted by the air traffic control tower that the aircraft had gone down.According to Branford fire department deputy chief Jason Karpovich, the initial emergency call was reported as a “boat taking on water” before a dispatcher realised it involved a sinking plane. Fire officials arrived at the crash site in a rescue boat roughly 25 minutes after the incident, by which time the aircraft was fully submerged.The Piper PA-32 is a single-engine plane built by Piper Aircraft. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the FAA.",Piper PA-32 went down near the Thimble Islands around 10.30 am.

A peaceful gathering in downtown Boulder in Colorado turned into chaos on Sunday when a man shouted “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into a group raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza. Law enforcement officials said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, injuring six people, some with serious burns.The attacker, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is expected to face charges. The FBI is investigating the incident as a ""terrorist act.""The attack took place on Pearl Street Mall, a popular four-block pedestrian area in Boulder, and comes amid rising global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.Just a week ago, a man reportedly yelling the same slogan fatally shot two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington.“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation,” he said.According to officials, the victims range from 67 to 88 years old and suffered injuries ranging from minor to serious.The group had just wrapped up a weekly demonstration organised by 'Run For Their Lives', which calls for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.A witness captured part of the chaos on video, shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as police approached a shirtless man holding containers in both hands.Lynn Segal, 72, who was among the roughly 20 participants, described seeing a “rope of fire” shoot in front of her, followed by “two big flares.”“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” Segal said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”She shared that while she supports Palestine and was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt, she feared she might be mistaken as being connected to the attacker.Authorities confirmed Soliman acted alone and are not seeking any other suspects. He was also injured in the incident and taken to a hospital, though details of his condition have not been released. While no formal charges have yet been announced, officials assured the public that Soliman will be held accountable.FBI deputy director Dan Bongino stated: “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”The justice department condemned the attack as a ""needless act of violence"", referencing a recent wave of attacks targeting Jewish Americans.This latest violence is part of the growing unrest since October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed about 1200 people in southern Israel and took around 250 hostages.Today, 58 hostages remain in Gaza, with about a third believed to be alive.Israel’s military response has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, and displaced about 90% of the population, leaving most reliant on international aid.Sunday's incident also brought back memories of a mass shooting in Boulder four years ago, when a gunman killed four people at a local grocery store. He was later sentenced to life in prison.After the attack, police evacuated multiple blocks of Pearl Street. Armed officers and K9 units swept the area, urging the public to stay away as they searched for additional threats.","A man shouted 'Free Palestine' and threw an incendiary device into a group raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Why the Change Matters



The Bottom Line





In a sweeping administrative change, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) has officially ended its role in issuing birth and death certificates. These vital registration services are now handled by Emirates Health Services (EHS) in the northern emirates, while Dubai and Abu Dhabi continue under their respective local health authorities.The transition was made quietly, with MoHAP removing all related service options from its website and discontinuing its WhatsApp-based application system. Residents are now required to navigate a decentralised process based on their emirate of residence.MoHAP has withdrawn from issuing birth and death certificates.Parents (of any nationality), legal guardians, or authorised delegates.Immediate family members or legally authorised persons.Certificates must be attested by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the embassy of the relevant foreign country.The UAE is continuing its trend of devolving administrative authority to regional bodies, particularly for citizen services. Emirates Health Services already manages most public healthcare in the northern emirates, making it a natural successor to MoHAP in handling life-event documentation.The next time you need a birth or death certificate in the UAE, MoHAP is no longer your go-to authority. Depending on where you live, you’ll be interacting with EHS, DHA, or DoH—with new procedures, slightly altered fees, and a greater push toward digital verification.While the transition might be procedural, it signals a larger shift in how civil documentation is administered across the UAE—more digital, more localised, and firmly tied to regional health systems.(Exchange rate used: 1 AED = ₹22.60)","Emirates Health Services (EHS) is responsible in Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah.

"Yelled 'Free Palestine', used makeshift flamethrower: What we know about 'targeted terror attack' in Colorado",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yelled-free-palestine-used-makeshift-flamethrower-what-we-know-about-targeted-terror-attack-in-colorado/articleshow/121558794.cms,"The suspect has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was being confronted by crowd (Image Credit: X)

Here are 10 things to know about attack

What happened?: Mohamed Sabry Soliman, aged 45, allegedly carried out an assault using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and an ""incendiary device"". During the incident, he was heard exclaiming ""free Palestine"". The attack targeted a gathering at a ""regularly scheduled, weekly, peaceful event"", which was identified as a Run for Their Lives programme that advocates for Israeli hostages currently detained in Gaza. Law enforcement officials have expressed confidence in having apprehended the sole perpetrator and have found no links between the suspect and any organised groups.

Who are the victims: Six individuals, with ages ranging from 67 to 88 years, were injured in the attack. All victims required hospitalisation for treatment of burns and additional injuries. Reports indicate that at least one person sustained severe injuries.

A video, apparently filmed during the incident, shows a shirtless man holding spray bottles as a fire burns on the grass in front of him. He is heard yelling, “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is Free!” and “They are killers!” toward people in red t-shirts tending to someone lying on the ground.In another video shared on X, the same man is seen arguing with bystanders, saying at one point, “I can, I can.”

Authorities vow to hold suspect 'fully accountable': Boulder County's District Attorney Michael Dougherty aligns with the FBI's assessment, stating ""we are in the very early stages here"". He confirms the unified approach amongst agencies, saying ""to hold the attacker fully accountable"". ""That is my promise,"" he states. ""We are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable."" The police have indicated that no additional updates will be provided this evening.

'Targeted terror attack,' says FBI: FBI Director Kash Patel has called the incident a 'terror attack' while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it ""appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted."" In a post on X, Kash Patel said, ""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

Who is the suspect: The FBI has revealed that Mohamed Sabry Soliman was responsible for the incident where he shouted ""free Palestine"" whilst attacking a march in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday. The 45-year-old Soliman had targeted the American Jewish organisation Run for Their Lives, which coordinates events advocating for the swift release of Hamas-held hostages, as stated on their website.

'Violence must stop,' says homeland Security Secretary: The department of homeland security's head, Kristi Noem, confirmed that her organisation is collaborating with various agencies, notably the FBI, and promised to provide additional details once available. ""We are praying for the victims and their families. This violence must stop.

Witness recounts: Eyewitnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled ""End Zionist!"" during the attack. They reported seeing individuals lying on the ground in pain while others rushed with water to provide assistance. According to UCHealth, two casualties were airlifted to their burn treatment facility. Police confirmed that Boulder Community Hospital received four additional patients. Redfearn stated that all six patients remained under medical care as of 7 p.m. local time.

Tulsi Gabbard thanks first responders and local authorities for your quick response: Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, ""The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.""

Run For Their Lives, the event organiser, emphasised, ""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release."" The participants gathered at 1 p.m. at the intersection of Pearl Street and 8th Street, proceeding to walk along Pearl Street Mall in both directions, pausing at the courthouse to view a video presentation.





At least six people were injured in what the FBI called a ""targeted terror attack"" in the US state of Colorado after a suspect carried out an ""act of terrorism"" on a pedestrian mall on Sunday afternoon.The suspect has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" while using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd, according to Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek.Six people were hospitalized with burns, including one who was seriously injured, according to the police.","Suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of Boulder, Colorado.

Kristi Noem Faces Intense US Senate Grilling Over Sick American Child’s Deportation





US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem 's claim that an undocumented immigrant had threatened to assassinate US President Donald Trump is now under scrutiny, as new evidence suggests the man may have been falsely accused to force his deportation.Noem had announced the arrest of 54-year-old Ramon Morales Reyes, alleging he had sent a letter vowing to shoot Trump and then flee to Mexico. The letter, shared by Noem and later highlighted by the White House and Trump allies on social media, was written in light blue ink and appeared to express fury over immigration policies.However, a person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities now believe Morales Reyes did not write the letter. Instead, law enforcement suspected that he was framed, possibly to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial in which he is listed as a victim of assault. The source said that the handwritten threat did not match Morales Reyes' writing style after which officials concluded that the threat was not credible.Despite this, the department of homeland security issued a statement naming Morales Reyes as the author and describing him as a threat, a move that has drawn criticism and confusion.The department has since said the investigation remains “ongoing,” and that Reyes is in the country illegally and has a criminal record.His legal team disputed those claims, saying he is not currently facing any charges and has no knowledge of past convictions.“There is really no way that it could be even remotely true,” said Kime Abduli, Morales Reyes’ immigration lawyer. “We're asking for a clarification and a correction from DHS to clear Ramon’s name of anything having to do with this.”Morales Reyes, a dishwasher in Milwaukee, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin. He lives with his wife and three children and had recently applied for a U visa, which offers protection to undocumented immigrants who have been victims of serious crimes.The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera has called for his release, and Morales Reyes is expected to appear before a Chicago immigration court next week for a bond hearing.Meanwhile, Milwaukee police have launched a separate investigation into possible identity theft and witness intimidation in connection with the case. The local district attorney’s office confirmed the matter is under active review.Morales Reyes had been due to testify in a July trial involving a man accused of assaulting him, a case that may now be further complicated by his sudden detention.","Ramon Morales Reyes, 54, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz aimed to fire up Democratic activists at the party’s state convention in South Carolina, continuing to build his national profile after being selected by Kamala Harris as the 2024 vice presidential nominee.Walz, a former teacher, congressman, and now governor, delivered the keynote address in Columbia, an event known for drawing national Democratic figures and possible future presidential candidates.In a 30-minute speech, he used blunt language to criticise US President Donald Trump and called on Democrats to stand firm against what he described as a “bully” in the White House.“Maybe it’s time we get a little tougher,” Walz said to applause. “When it’s a bully like Donald Trump, you bully the s—- out of him. ... This is a ... cruel man.”The speech was Walz’s third major address in less than 24 hours. He also spoke at a fundraising dinner and at a fish fry hosted by representative Jim Clyburn alongside Maryland governor Wes Moore.Addressing the crowd again on Saturday, Walz warned that Trump is “the existential threat that we knew was coming,” while commending South Carolina Democrats for their persistence in a deeply Republican state where the party hasn’t won a statewide race in nearly two decades and holds only one congressional seat—Clyburn’s.“Damnit, we should be able to have some fun and be joyful,” he added. “We’ve got the guts and we need to have it to push back on the bullies and the greed.”Walz is seen as a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination and has been traveling to early primary states.

Michelle Obama Gets Candid About Mental Health: 'I'm In Therapy...'





Former First Lady Michelle Obama is drawing criticism after saying that creating life is ""the least"" of what a woman's reproductive system does. The remarks came during the latest episode of her podcast 'IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson. 'In a wide-ranging discussion on women's health and abortion rights, Obama said the conversation around reproductive issues has been unfairly narrowed. ""Women's reproductive health is about our life,"" she said. ""It's about this whole complicated reproductive system that the least of what it does is produce life. It's a very important thing that it does, but you only produce life if the machine that's producing it — if you want to whittle us down to a machine — is functioning in a healthy, streamlined kind of way. ""The former first lady emphasised that the lack of medical research and understanding of women's health often leads to narrow or misguided political decision-making, particularly among male lawmakers. She also criticised Republican men for inaction on abortion rights, accusing them of ""trading out women's health for a tax break or whatever it is.""Additionally, Obama aimed at GOP women, suggesting some had voted for US President Donald Trump because of their husbands' influence.""There are a lot of women who vote the way their man is going to vote,"" she said. ""It happened in this election.""Her comments quickly ignited backlash on social media and from conservative figures, who accused Obama of diminishing the importance of motherhood.""Motherhood is the most beautiful and powerful gift God gave women. Creating life isn't a side effect, it's a miracle,"" wrote Danielle D'Souza Gill, a prominent pro-life advocate and wife of Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas. ""Don't let the Left cheapen it.""Isabel Brown, a conservative author and influencer, also lashed out. ""I am SO sick and tired of celebrities and elitists attempting to convince you that your miraculous superpower ability to GROW LIFE from nothing is somehow demeaning and ‘lesser than' for women,"" she posted.Social media users echoed those sentiments, with some questioning whether Obama's comments reflected her views on her own children. ""How do her kids feel after hearing their mother demeaning motherhood?"" one user wrote.","Michelle Obama said creating life is ""the least"" of what a woman's reproductive system does.

A boy with a big dream

Family’s unwavering hope





Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, the 13-year-old Texas boy who captured hearts across America with his courage in battling terminal brain cancer and his dream of becoming a police officer, has been diagnosed with three new tumours, the White House confirmed on Friday.DJ, who was sworn in by US President Donald Trump earlier this year during a joint session of Congress, became a national symbol of resilience and hope. Despite receiving a grim prognosis in 2018, doctors then said he had less than five months to live. DJ has undergone numerous brain surgeries and defied expectations, thanks in part to a clinical research program.His father, Theodis Daniel, shared the news with White House officials.“We’re lifting up Agent DJ Daniel in prayer after his dad, Theodis, shared that DJ is now facing three new tumors,” the White House posted on X. “DJ is one of the strongest, bravest young men—and has now been sworn into 1,351 law enforcement agencies across the country. Agent Daniel, you're a true legend.”DJ’s dream of becoming a police officer has taken him on a cross-country journey of honour. With the support of law enforcement agencies nationwide, he has been ceremonially sworn in by over 1,300 departments, surpassing his original goal of 1,000 and setting a new benchmark of inspiration.His most recent swearing-in was with the Williamson County sheriff’s office in Texas. Deputy Jeffrey Combs recalled the emotional moment: “I saw Theodis pick his son up. I felt that unconditional love, and I just knew I had to find DJ. So, it all worked out.”In April, DJ was also named an honorary officer of the United States park police by interior secretary Doug Burgum, himself a cancer survivor.Speaking to FOX 7 Austin, Theodis Daniel described the toll the new diagnosis has taken on the family. “It’s rough. There isn’t a class that can teach you how to deal with it. You’re hearing that your child has a nasty disease,” he said. “We’re just winging it day by day.”Despite the worsening prognosis, DJ’s family continues to spread a message of unity and compassion. “We're just going around showing people, ‘Hey, you do care for one another,’” Theodis said. “Let’s give compassion, and let’s try to join and help each other get through things.”","Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, 13, has been diagnosed with three new tumours.

A gesture made by US senator Cory Booker at the California Democratic convention on Saturday is drawing widespread comparisons to a similar move by Elon Musk earlier this year, and now, Musk himself has weighed in.Booker concluded his speech to delegates with an extended-arm gesture that many on social media likened to a Nazi salute — the same controversial comparison that was made when Musk placed his hand on his chest and then extended it outward during Donald Trump’s second inauguration.At the time, Musk was harshly criticised by many Democrats, who claimed the move resembled fascist symbolism. Musk defended his gesture, explaining it as a heartfelt message: “My heart goes out to you.”Now, with Booker, a prominent Democrat, making a near-identical gesture, Musk reacted to the video with an emoji on his X handle.Booker, 56, has not responded to the viral claims. The moment came as Booker addressed delegates, encouraging them to “get into some good trouble,” quoting the late civil rights icon John Lewis.The senator focused much of his speech on the need to resist US President Donald Trump’s agenda and rebuild trust with voters.“I think the Democratic Party lost a lot of elections because people didn't believe that they cared about them,” he said. “So let's stop worrying about the politics and get more focused on the people.”He went on to stress the importance of activism and creativity in civic engagement.“I know one thing it's not is sitting down and doing nothing and just watching on TV and getting stuck in a state of sedentary agitation. Everybody has to be taking measures to put the pressure on to change,” he said.However, the speech’s closing moment quickly overshadowed the rest of his speech.“I’m literally shaking right now. Cory Booker is literally Hitler,” one social media user wrote.Another post read, “Cory Booker does a NAZI SALUTE at the California Democratic Convention HOLY CRAP! LITERALLY HITLER!”Booker, who ran for president in 2020, said after the convention that he’s focused on running for reelection to the senate in 2026. When asked about a possible 2028 presidential bid, he replied, “2028 will take care of itself.”Critics have also pointed out that earlier this year, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon faced similar scrutiny for a comparable gesture.",US senator Cory Booker made an extended-arm gesture at the California Democratic convention.

Who is Mohamed Sabry Soliman? Suspect in Colorado firebomb attack shouted 'Free Palestine',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-mohamed-sabry-soliman-suspect-in-colorado-firebomb-attack-shouted-free-palestine/articleshow/121559017.cms,"Who is Mohamed Sabry Soliman?



Attack caught on video, motive under probe







Six people were hospitalised after a man shouting “Free Palestine” allegedly lit them on fire during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. The FBI has identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who is in the United States illegally after overstaying his visa.FBI Denver Field Office special agent Mark Michalek said Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower to target attendees of a vigil for Israeli hostages. “As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek stated.The six victims, aged between 67 and 88, sustained injuries ranging from minor to severe burns. According to journalist Collin Rugg, citing Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Soliman entered the US on August 27, 2022, through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) during the Biden administration. “The Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the US illegally as a visa overstay who entered the US during the Biden administration,” Melugin reported.Mohamed Sabry Soliman, described by authorities as the man behind Sunday’s attack, is reportedly a foreign national who overstayed his visa after arriving in the US two years ago. While the FBI confirmed his Egyptian nationality, journalist Laura Loomer has claimed that Soliman is originally an immigrant from Kuwait who entered under what she called “Joe Biden’s open border policies.”In a post on X, Loomer alleged, “Mohamad Soliman, the Muslim man who carried out the Islamic terrorist attack in Colorado today, appears to be an immigrant from Kuwait who recently arrived in the US under Joe Biden’s open border policies 2 years ago.”Loomer also said a professional profile matching Soliman's name and appearance suggested he worked in finance, digital marketing, and international financial reporting. She further claimed he has a daughter studying in Colorado.Eyewitness Brooke Coffman, 19, described the chaotic aftermath: “Everybody is yelling, ‘get water, get water,’” she said, recalling seeing four women with burns, one of them wrapped in a flag. A video from the scene shows a shirtless man—believed to be Soliman—holding spray bottles as flames burn on the ground. He is heard shouting, “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is Free!” and “They are killers!” at people trying to assist the injured.Also read: 'Targeted terror attack': Man attacks crowd with firebombs in Colorado, several injured The attack took place during a gathering organised by ‘Run For Their Lives’, a global initiative advocating for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Soliman was taken into custody shortly after the incident. While no charges have been formally announced yet, authorities have said they intend to hold him “fully accountable.”Police evacuated multiple blocks around 13th and Pearl Streets, deploying K-9 units and advising the public to stay clear of the area. FBI Director Kash Patel said agents were on-site and more updates would be shared soon.The attack comes amid a surge in antisemitic incidents across the United States. Just last week, a man was arrested after fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers while shouting “Free, Free Palestine.”Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the violence, stating, “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” and said he was “closely monitoring” the situation.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower to set six people on fire during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado.

US President Donald Trump issued a stark warning on Sunday, following the legal challenge to his controversial tariff policy, claiming that blocking his emergency powers could bring a disaster for the American economy.Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, he wrote, “If the Courts somehow rule against us on Tariffs, which is not expected, that would allow other Countries to hold our Nation hostage with their anti-American Tariffs that they would use against us.""""This would mean the Economic ruination of the United States of America!” he further warned.His remarks follow the US Court of International Trade's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every country. The court said the move was a misuse of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is intended for actual emergencies.However, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily blocked that ruling on Thursday, granting the Trump administration permission to continue collecting tariffs while the case is under appeal.According to a statement from the appeals court, “The request for an immediate administrative stay is granted to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers.”The legal tug-of-war has deepened the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff regime, which during his presidency was blamed for market volatility, disrupted supply chains, and contributing to inflationary pressure.While the latest court order offers a temporary reprieve for Trump’s trade agenda, the final outcome remains undecided, and could have far-reaching consequences for US trade policy and the global economy.","US President Donald Trump issued a stark warning on Sunday, following the legal challenge to his controversial tariff policy.

"'Putin is a thug': US senators say he’s stalling peace with Ukraine, planning new offensive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/putin-is-a-thug-us-senators-say-hes-stalling-peace-with-ukraine-planning-new-offensive/articleshow/121554012.cms,"Vladimir Putin (left); Donald Trump (right): File photo





Two senior US senators have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is deliberately delaying peace negotiations while gearing up for a fresh military offensive in Ukraine.Speaking from Paris on Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal said the coming two weeks could be crucial in shaping the future of a war that has devastated cities, displaced millions, and reshaped Europe’s security landscape.The senators met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and visited areas devastated by what they described as the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began. Now in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron who they say is “100% aligned” with their views, they cautioned that the window to prevent another assault is rapidly closing.Central to their efforts is a sweeping bipartisan US sanctions bill aimed at crippling the Kremlin’s war economy. The legislation, which has broad support in the Senate but faces uncertain prospects in Washington, would impose crippling tariffs of 500% on countries continuing to import Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other key exports. Nations such as China and India, which account for around 70% of Russia’s energy trade, would be the main targets.Senator Graham called it “the most draconian bill I’ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.”He said, “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,"" adding, ""We’re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”Both senators expressed concern over the slow progress in peace talks, scheduled to resume on Monday in Istanbul. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to put forward any serious proposals, a delay the senators described as a calculated stalling tactic by Putin to buy time for a new offensive.“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said bluntly. “He’s taking him for a sucker.” He added, “He’s stalling and stonewalling to mount this offensive and seize more territory.”Graham agreed, warning, “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He’s preparing for more war.”Despite the urgent calls, US President Donald Trump has yet to back the sanctions bill, saying, “I don’t know. I’ll have to see it.” Graham noted the legislation was drafted with input from Trump’s advisers and praised his diplomatic instincts, but said, “It’s become painfully clear he’s not interested in ending this war.”The senators hope their direct encounters with the devastation in Ukraine will sway opinions in Washington. “He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” Blumenthal said.Their visit also laid bare the grim human cost of the conflict. Graham highlighted estimates that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia, calling their return “a matter of justice, not diplomacy.” Blumenthal spoke of visiting mass graves in Bucha, where civilians were executed at close range. “Putin is a thug. He’s a murderer,” he said.Both men warned that failure to act now could pull the US deeper into the conflict. “If Putin is not stopped, Nato treaty obligations could force American troops into battle,” Blumenthal cautioned.Following a meeting with Macron, both senators expressed confidence that Europe is ready to strengthen its stance. “President Macron has shown moral clarity,” Blumenthal said. “He is 100% aligned with the message we’re taking back to Washington.”As Ukraine’s military leaders prepare to brief Congress, a vote on the sanctions bill could soon follow. Graham concluded, ""President Trump said we’ll know in two weeks whether he’s being strung along.""""There will be more evidence from Russia on Monday.”","Two senior US senators warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin is deliberately delaying peace negotiations while gearing up for a fresh military offensive in Ukraine.

Lives at risk: Trump cuts slash safety funds for nation’s most dangerous work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lives-at-risk-trump-cuts-slash-safety-funds-for-nations-most-dangerous-work/articleshow/121552673.cms,"



More than a dozen workplace safety training centres across the United States could be forced to close by the end of the summer, as sweeping job cuts at a key federal health agency take effect under the Trump administration’s cost-cutting drive.The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which supports training and research for some of the country’s most hazardous jobs, has lost nearly 90% of its workforce. Out of around 1,000 employees, only about 125 were left after job cuts on April 1, according to union data seen by Reuters.Although 300 employees were rehired in May, the team managing the 12 Centres for Agricultural Safety and Health, which support fishing, farming, and logging workers, was not part of this. Because of this, several centres are getting ready to close as their funding runs out.Training programmes run by groups like the Fishing Partnership Support Services (FPSS) and the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association face potential shutdowns by July or September. These programmes have provided critical hands-on safety training to thousands of workers, including how to handle fires, administer first aid, deploy life rafts, and use emergency radio equipment.Without these federally funded courses, experts warn that more workers will be at risk and the burden on rescue services could increase.“The return on investment of the government is huge,” said John Roberts, a retired Coast Guard officer and FPSS safety instructor. “If they give us this money to do this training, it’s going to lessen how much money has to be spent to rescue the untrained.”The US department of health and human services, which oversees NIOSH, said in a statement, “The work will continue. HHS supports America’s farmers, fishmen, and logging workers.” Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr defended the staff reductions in March, citing the need to streamline bureaucracy. NIOSH is now set to be absorbed into a new body called the Administration for a Healthy America.The decision comes despite the fact that fishing, farming and logging remain the deadliest industries in the US. Combined, they represent a small portion of the national workforce but recorded a fatal injury rate of 24.4 per 100,000 workers in 2023, seven times the national average.Many of the affected workers operate in remote locations where access to emergency medical care can be delayed by hours. Over the years, the NIOSH-backed centres have helped reduce those risks through safety research, direct education, and public health outreach.In 2024 alone, the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety trained more than 5,600 workers. Other centres have introduced mobile health clinics, mental health support, and opioid overdose prevention in rural areas.But with grant funding set to expire between July and September, many of these initiatives are under threat. At the Southeastern Coastal Center for Agricultural Health and Safety in Florida, staff have already begun closing research programmes and worker outreach efforts.“We're shutting down the direct education to the workers, we're shutting down the research,” said director J Glenn Morris.Although some industry groups offer private training, the cost remains a barrier for many. Without continued federal support, safety experts fear that many vulnerable workers will lose access to life-saving resources.","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has lost nearly 90% of its workforce.

We've got to be ready







WASHINGTON: A logjam in the trade talks between the United States and China could be broken once Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak, US officials said Sunday a conversation they said could happen soon.Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating a deal reached last month in Geneva to temporarily lower staggeringly high tariffs the world's two biggest economies had imposed on each other, in a pause to last 90 days.China's slow-walking on export license approvals for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars and chips have fueled US frustration, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday a concern since confirmed by US officials.But US treasury secretary Scott Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch on Sunday, telling CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the gaps could soon be bridged.""I'm confident that when President Trump and Party chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,"" Bessent said, however noting that China was ""withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.""When asked if rare earths were one of those products, Bessent said, ""Yes.""""Maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it's intentional. We'll see after the president speaks with"" Xi, he said.On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: ""I believe we will see something very soon.""Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's national economic council told ABC that the call could happen ""this week"" but that he had no confirmation of a scheduled time.Since Trump returned to the presidency, he has slapped sweeping tariffs on most US trading partners, with especially high rates on Chinese imports.New tit-for-tat levies on both sides reached three digits before the de-escalation this month, where Washington agreed to temporarily reduce additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 percent to 30 percent.China, meanwhile, lowered its added duties from 125 percent to 10 percent.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told ""Fox News Sunday"" that China was ""slow-rolling the deal,"" adding: ""We are taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation.""""Our president understands what to do.

"Teenagers found dead in Arizona forest, police launches investigation into 'suspicious' deaths",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teenagers-found-dead-in-arizona-forest-police-launches-investigation-into-suspicious-deaths/articleshow/121552221.cms,"



Two teenagers have been found shot dead in a remote part of the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, just days after their summer holidays began. Police are investigating their deaths as “suspicious”.The bodies of Pandora Kjolsrud, 18, and Evan Clark, 17, were discovered on the morning of May 27, near Mount Ord, a spot the two friends often watched sunsets at. They had both suffered fatal gunshot wounds, the Maricopa county sheriff’s office said, quoted by the New York Post.“At this time, the circumstances surrounding their deaths are being treated as suspicious,” said Sgt Joaquin Enriquez, speaking to Fox 10 Phoenix.The Maricopa county medical examiner has since confirmed both deaths as homicides, with the date of death listed as 26 May.Kjolsrud and Clark were students at Arcadia High School in Phoenix, around 64 miles southwest of the national forest. The tragic news has shaken the local community and left friends and family grieving the loss of two young lives.“You just cherish all the memories and the laughs,” said Iara Rosales, Clark’s coworker.“His life was cut very short, and so was Pandora’s. They were very young, and it was just so sudden and a tragedy that you wouldn’t even imagine.”Friends of the teens created a makeshift memorial at their favourite spot near Mount Ord, laying flowers and tributes to the pair. Online fundraisers have also been set up to help their families cover costs for their celebrations of life.Kjolsrud was remembered by loved ones for her “vivacious personality” and love for the outdoors.“She was a beautiful human being and a bright light in this world who loved every single person she met and had a unique ability to make every person feel special,” family friend Kathryn Leonard wrote on GoFundMe. “The outdoors is where she truly felt at home. She loved camping, horseback riding, kayaking and hiking with friends and family.”Her mother, Simone Kjolsrud, posted a heartbreaking message on Facebook, “Rest in peace my beautiful girl,” adding that her heart was shattered into a million pieces.Clark’s mother, Sandra Malibu Sweeney, described her son as an “old soul” with a gentle heart.“Evan Clark was my only child and my beloved son,” she wrote. “This last week Evan was taken from me, and my level of grief feels insurmountable. I find myself at a complete loss to imagine a life without him. It is a small comfort to share some things about this boy who was on his way to becoming a wonderful man.”The tragedy has left hikers and locals shaken, with concerns being raised about safety in the national forest.“If there’s something going on in the area. I’m here with my child. I’d like to know if we’re safe,” one resident told Fox 10.“Obviously, respecting the families, but I would want to know how we can all be safe.”","Pandora Kjolsrud, 18, and Evan Clark, 17, found dead in Tonto National Forest.

'There is no Joe Biden': Trump shares wild theory claiming former president is a clone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/there-is-no-joe-biden-trump-shares-wild-theory-claiming-former-president-is-a-clone/articleshow/121551189.cms,"



Donald Trump shared an outlandish conspiracy theory, claiming that former US president Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and now what stands in his place is a robotic clone.Trump, who remains active on his social media platform Truth Social, reposted a message late Saturday from a little-known user named “llijh”, who has fewer than 1,000 followers. The original post read, “There is no #JoeBiden - executed in 2020. #Biden clones doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see.> #Democrats dont know the difference.”Though Trump didn’t comment on the validity of the claim, his decision to share the post has drawn widespread attention. The president is known for mocking opponents online, and critics suggest the post may be another example of him trolling political rivals.The two men last met in person at the 2025 presidential inauguration roughly five months ago, having previously shared the debate stage during both the 2020 and 2024 campaigns. Since leaving office, Biden has become the focus of increasing scrutiny, particularly over his mental and physical health.Speculation intensified following the release of a recent book, “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” which questions his fitness for office.Trump has publicly questioned whether Biden was truly in charge of his administration, pointing to his use of an autopen to sign official documents, a process currently under investigation by House Republicans.“I think the autopen is going to become one of the great scandals of all time,” Trump said on Friday during a White House event attended by tech billionaire Elon Musk.“He’s been a sort of a moderate person over his life, and a smart person, but somewhat vicious person, I will say, if you feel sorry for him, don’t feel so sorry because he’s vicious,” The New York Post quoted.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers, led by house oversight committee chairman James Comer, have launched a probe into the president’s health, summoning five close associates for questioning.Last month, Biden’s team confirmed that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. Despite the diagnosis, Biden remains optimistic about his progress.“We’re going to be able to beat this,” he told reporters in New Castle, Delaware on Friday. “We’re working on everything, it’s moving along. I feel good.”","Donald Trump reposted a message from a user with fewer than 1,000 followers. The post claimed that former US president Joe Biden was executed in 2020.

Daughters' day? Not. MAGA takes aim at daughters of Mark Carney and Xi Jinping,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daughters-day-not-maga-takes-aim-at-daughters-of-carney-and-xi/articleshow/121551412.cms,"The TOI correspondent in Washington:





Daughters of Canada's prime minister Mark Carney and China's leader Xi Jinping are among Harvard students being targeted for expulsion by MAGA principals amid the Trump administration's drive to tame liberal US universities seen as being out of sync with the current White House outlook.MAGA-aligned outlets reported over the weekend that the Trump administration is examining the prospect of expelling Carney's daughter Cleo, a social studies major at Harvard with a record of liberal activism. She was reportedly arrested at a pro-Palestinian rally in London some months ago, and although she has been flying under the radar at Harvard, the fact that she introduced her father at the Liberal Party convention in March 2025 and is active in environmental advocacy, is sufficient to trigger MAGA, which has taken the cue from its supremo Trump to attack Canada and all things Canadian.Also in the MAGA crosshairs is Xi Mingze, daughter of China's leader Xi JInping, who graduated from Harvard under a pseudonym in 2014 with B.A. in psychology and is said to have returned to the institution recently for higher studies. MAGA trolls have been casing the university and social media for signs of Xi Mingze presence amid growing antipathy towards foreign students, particularly Chinese.The ""womanhunt"" involving the leaders of Canada and China comes on the heels of the Trump administration's blanket ban on foreign students coming to Harvard, leaving current students to transfer to other colleges or risk losing their visa status.“They (Harvard) have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted said last week, adding, “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country. ”Separately, MAGA trolls continued to attack Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American undergrad who attacked MIT's ties with the Israeli military and expressed support for the besieged in Gaza during her commencement speech, triggering MIT to ban her from the graduating ceremony. ""MIT supports free expression but can't allow anyone in disrupting an important Institute ceremony,"" the school said, even as Vemuri found vocal support from the liberal spectrum.Although the Trump administration's crackdown on Harvard and other liberal schools was ostensibly aimed at curtailing on-campus political activism by foreign students, particularly against Israel, the repression has taken on broader contours. There is now an all-out MAGA movement against students from across the world with the argument foreign students are ""stealing"" seats and jobs that should go to Americans first.Foreign students are coveted by American academia, both for the moolah ($ 44 billion) and mental acuity they bring in. It is generally acknowledged that education, not guns or butter, has been America's greatest export. Even moderate Republicans are aghast by the MAGA venom against international students.""Shutting out foreign students from @Harvard, the best university in the world, is a huge mistake. We lose their brainpower and the way they challenge and inspire our own students,"" former Ohio Governor John Kasich said last week, noting that many alumni return home as leaders with a deeper understanding of America. and that benefits the US.Prominent Indians who graduated from Harvard include Anand Mahindra, Rahul Bajaj, P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, and Naina Lal Kidwai. Hundreds more have attended executive courses at Harvard to hone their leadership skills.",Daughters of Canada's prime minister Mark Carney and China's leader Xi Jinping are among Harvard students being targeted for expulsion by MAGA principals.

‘He already did 25 years’: Wife left with silence and anger





Ngoc Phan was ready to say goodbye. She had packed her husband’s bags, coordinated with relatives in Vietnam, and braced herself for the emotional toll of starting a life apar, temporarily. Her husband, Tuan Thanh Phan, a green card holder who served 25 years in prison for a 2000 gang-related killing, was set for deportation to Vietnam.But without warning, ICE put him on a plane to South Sudan.“There was no indication that he was going to be sent anywhere else except Vietnam,” Phan said as quoted by NPR. “We planned for it… and then in the middle of the night, they picked him up and sent him to South Sudan.”NPR reported that Phan’s husband wasn’t the only one. Others with roots in Mexico, Cuba, Burma, and Laos were also told they’d be deported to South Africa, before being rerouted to South Sudan, one of the most politically unstable and dangerous countries in the world.The Biden administration argues these individuals’ home countries refuse to take them back due to their criminal histories, and that deporting them to third countries is a necessary public safety measure.“These are the ones you don’t want in your community,” said Todd Lyons, ICE Acting Director.Lawyers representing the detainees quickly challenged the deportations, calling them unlawful and rushed. Many weren’t given enough time, sometimes less than 24 hours, to contest being removed to a country they had no connection to.“It’s just a complete renunciation of our justice system,” said Matt Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, as reported by NPR.Federal Judge Brian Murphy sided with the attorneys, ruling that deportees deserve 15 days and information in their native language to challenge removals to unfamiliar countries, especially those where they might face violence or persecution.The use of third countries in deportations isn’t new. In the past, the US has sent migrants to Mexico when their own countries refused to accept them. Vietnam, for instance, has strict conditions for accepting deportees, usually limited to those who arrived before 1995.But the administration’s turn to countries like South Sudan, and previously Libya, marks a dangerous shift, say legal experts.“These deportations are happening in a rushed fashion,” said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “That means the administration is dangerously close to violating due process.”After Judge Murphy’s injunction, the plane carrying the deportees landed at a military base in Djibouti. The men remain there with ICE agents, stuck in legal limbo as the Biden administration challenges the ruling at the Supreme Court.The government argues that the judiciary is overstepping into foreign policy and immigration enforcement.“While certain aliens may benefit from stalling their removal, the Nation does not,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in the appeal.The Supreme Court is expected to consider the matter after lawyers for the deportees respond by June 4.Ngoc Phan hasn’t heard from her husband since he boarded the plane.“I’m angry about it,” she said. “They want to call him a barbaric monster without really understanding the details of his case… He already did 25 years.”What was supposed to be the start of a new chapter, one planned and painful, has become a legal and emotional abyss.","US has used third-country removals before, but South Sudan raises alarms.

"Pakistan crop-sowing in crisis as dams run low, India tightens Chenab flow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-crop-sowing-in-crisis-as-dams-run-low-india-tightens-chenab-flow/articleshow/121556248.cms,"AI-generated image used for representation

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.",Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image.

Pak SSG Loaned Commando To Lashkar? Probe Reveals ISI’s Hand in Pahalgam Attack | Watch





NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election. He styled himself as a thorn in India's side. ""Main rehta hun Hindustan ke dil me kaante ki tarah. Apne rab ka shukr karta hu. Agla election Modi ke muqable mai na lad lun,"" he said.He also said that India had tried a lot to isolate Pakistan and specific individuals, but now it was they who stood isolated. Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar. Since the Pahalgam attack, the outfits have intensified public rallies to gather funds in the name of supporting the jihad in Kashmir.",LeT commander Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan, including an airport in Rawalpindi.Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.Speaking at the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described the sequence of events and Pakistan's intended response. ""We on 9th and 10th night we decided to respond in a measured fashion to Indian aggression,"" he said.""And we had decided that at 4:30 in the morning after Fajr prayers, Pakistan armed forces led very ably by our Field Marshal Chief Army Staff sitting here, Syed Asam Munir to teach a lesson to our enemy. But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan.

And no one is willing to admit these are mistakes which need to be fixed. So many new projects are being launched, new trains are being discussed — but the old systems, like availability of water in the washrooms of an international airport, are being ignored.It’s truly unfortunate,"" she added.The video went viral on Indian social media, as it comes in the backdrop of India putting in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.Putting the water agreement in abeyance is among several diplomatic and military steps taken by India in retaliation to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.

'Talks Only On Return Of PoK': India Rejects Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif's Call For Dialogue | Kashmir





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday repeated his call to hold talks with India, urging both nations to sit down ""for peace"" and resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism. The change of tone in Pakistan's language can be noticed after India's punitive diplomatic steps and strong military counterterror action under Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, in retaliation of Pahalgam terror attack.His remarks came during the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, where he was joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.This was Sharif’s second call for dialogue in a week. On Monday, while in Tehran, he expressed a similar willingness to engage with India “to resolve all disputes.”“We must sit together and talk for the sake of peace… There are issues that demand immediate attention and must be addressed through dialogue,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.He added, “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region[…] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”Sharif also expressed openness to discussing counterterrorism with India, saying, “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.” He further stated his desire to resume trade ties, and criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty , calling it a vital resource for Pakistan's drinking and agricultural needs.However, India has made its stance unequivocally clear: talks with Pakistan will only focus on two issues, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first statement following Operation Sindoor, said: “Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”Tensions between the two countries have intensified since the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 dead.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor, a coordinated military campaign that began on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.The conflict de-escalated after both sides agreed to halt military actions following a meeting between their directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif calls for talks with India to resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism.

Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling.

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Sheikh Hasina and two others charged with crimes against humanity.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

A protester on Monday confronted King Charles outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, questioning him about Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein while the monarch was greeting royal supporters. The incident occurred amid renewed scrutiny of the royal family's knowledge of Andrew's ties to the late sex offender.The heckler directly challenged the King, shouting: ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?""The protest comes as Prince Andrew, 65, recently announced he would stop using his Duke of York title following years of controversy over his association with Epstein.The protester also questioned potential police involvement, calling out: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? Should the MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""The King continued engaging with other members of the public, ignoring the protestor's remarks.Recent developments have intensified public interest in the matter, including the contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse when she was a teenager.Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's allegations. He reached an undisclosed settlement in 2022 to resolve a US lawsuit filed by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.British law enforcement is currently investigating media reports that Andrew requested a police officer to gather compromising information about Giuffre in 2011.The renewed attention to the case has kept the royal family under public scrutiny, despite Andrew's recent decision to distance himself from his royal title.","Protester confronted King Charles outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England.

Hurricane Melissa hits category 5: Strongest storm of 2025 nears Jamaica; Caribbean braces for catastrophic floods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-melissa-hits-category-5-strongest-storm-of-2025-nears-jamaica-caribbean-braces-for-catastrophic-floods/articleshow/124862924.cms,"Hurricane Melissa moving towards Jamaica (AP)

Track and timing



Strength and intensification



Impacts so far & risks ahead



In Jamaica, authorities imposed mandatory evacuations for parts of the southern coast including Port Royal and activated emergency funding of at least US $33 million.



Prior to reaching Jamaica, Melissa triggered heavy rainfall across Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with confirmed deaths and large-scale evacuations.

Forecasters expect rainfall totals of up to 40 inches (≈1 m) in portions of Jamaica, and storm surge peaking near 13 feet (4 m) along the southern coast.



Mountainous regions are especially vulnerable: the combination of heavy rain, steep slopes and deforested terrain raises landslide danger



Preparation and warnings



Climate context







Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 system and the strongest storm anywhere in the world this year, is barreling toward Jamaica with sustained winds nearing 280 km/h, threatening catastrophic flooding, landslides and coastal storm surges across the Caribbean. The US national hurricane center (NHC) said the storm, which underwent explosive intensification over the weekend, has become a “potentially catastrophic” cyclone as it inches closer to the island’s southern coastline.By late Monday, Melissa was located roughly 200 km south-southwest of Kingston, moving slowly westward at about 5 kilometres per hour - a sluggish pace that forecasters warn will amplify rainfall and prolong destructive winds over Jamaica and neighbouring islands. The system has already lashed parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving several dead and thousands displaced, according to the AP.Meteorologists describe Melissa as the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, drawing strength from exceptionally warm ocean waters - nearly 2-3 °C above average - and calm upper-level winds that have allowed it to rapidly intensify. Authorities in Jamaica have ordered evacuations along low-lying southern areas, shuttered airports, and urged residents to brace for what Prime Minister Andrew Holness called a “historic and life-threatening event.Melissa is forecast to cross Jamaica late early Tuesday, then advance toward eastern Cuba on Tuesday night and reach the Bahamas by Wednesday.At the latest advisory, the storm was located roughly 205 km south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, moving westward at about 6 km/h. The slow pace is a key factor in the threat, it increases the duration of exposure to high winds and heavy rain, and allows flooding and landslides to build. Experts say Melissa’s rapid escalation to Category 5 was driven by unusually warm Atlantic waters and favourable atmospheric conditions.According to the NHC and other meteorologists, the storm may now rank among the most powerful ever to enter the Caribbean Sea, with sustained winds around 175 mph. The NHC issued stark warnings: “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday.” Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica emphasised: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5.”Transport Minister Daryl Vaz urged residents: “Don’t make foolish decisions… We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.”Shelters have been opened and airports closed. Still, concerns linger about looting, inability to evacuate remote communities and potential delays in aid due to cut-off roads and communication loss. Meteorologists say storms like Melissa are emblematic of a warming world: ocean temperatures in the relevant zone are about 2-3 °C above average, creating a “vast reservoir of energy” for hurricane intensification.“It doesn’t mean every single cyclone will go through rapid or super-rapid intensification,” noted climate scientist Bernadette Woods Placky, “but in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid or super-rapid intensification.”(With inputs from agecies)","Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 system, is barreling toward Jamaica with sustained winds nearing 280 km/h.

‘No idea how long people can hold out’: US govt shutdown continues; federal workers feel brunt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-idea-how-long-people-can-hold-out-us-govt-shutdown-continues-federal-workers-feel-brunt/articleshow/124861871.cms,"'Trump Trusts Us To Fix…’: Johnson Goes Ballistic On Dems For ‘Appeasing Marxists’ | Shutdown Day 27





When Jill Hornick woke up on a recent Monday morning, her first thought was that her timecard would be submitted that day for her job with the Social Security Administration in Chicago. But this Monday was different. The federal government was locked in a shutdown, and she received a paycheck for $0. ""This is the only income I have,"" she said. ""And I just started crying. I had a meltdown.""Hornick, 59, is one of 730,000 federal employees working without pay because of the impasse. Another 670,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay, according to data from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.As the shutdown stretches toward its fifth week, those govt employees are confronting an increasingly acute scenario. Their bills are mounting, and there is no clear resolution in sight.Some are turning to side hustles such as delivering food, walking dogs and selling personal items to bring in a bit of income. Others are relying on food banks that have been organised to provide federal workers and contractors with free groceries - efforts that community service providers say reflect food insecurity caused by the shutdown.The widespread anxiety is punctuating what has already been a gruelling year for federal workers as the Trump administration has raced to shrink and reshape govt, and moved to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs.The last shutdown, which came during Trump's first term, was the longest ever, lasting 34 full days. The current standoff, which began Oct 1, could stretch even longer. There are no negotiations for a deal to reopen govt, which Democrats say must include an agreement to extend expiring subsidies for health insurance.The impact of the political paralysis could be seen early Friday morning as hundreds of cars lined a road in Northern Virginia, filled with federal workers and govt contractors waiting for boxes of food being distributed by a local non-profit group. It was one of five sites set up in partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank, a hunger relief organisation, to distribute groceries in the Washington region, which is home to nearly 20% of federal workforce.Casey Perez, a mother of five from Maryland who is furloughed from her civilian job at Fort Belvoir, said the last three weeks had been tough. ""I don't know how to get the mortgage paid,"" Perez, 34, said as three of her children waited patiently in the back seat of her car.Some federal workers are seeking creative ways to string together enough money to cover their bills. Imelda Avila-Thomas, a furloughed labour department employee in Texas, said she had been going from room to room inside her home to see what she could sell to help make ends meet. One piece of furniture jumped out: a tan pullout sofa that her late mother slept on when she visited. Avila-Thomas said that her mother had died in 2022, and that she had held on to the sofa as she was still processing her death. ""I don't think I was ready to get rid of it,"" she said. But she sold it for $40.Under federal law, govt is required to pay back federal workers once funds become available. But Trump has said that may not be the case for everyone. Not all federal workers are going unpaid. Around 830,000 federal employees are still receiving their salaries because their offices are self-funded or there is other money to use, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.As the shutdown continues, govt workers will have to make more tough decisions. Some said that they had called creditors seeking a reprieve. Others said that they were looking to take a loan out of their pension plans.","730,000 federal employees are working without pay because of the impasse.

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three





US transportation secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to non-citizens.In an appearance on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Duffy said governor Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with department of transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued. His statement came after investigations into two recent fatal crashes involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licences (CDLs).""So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California,"" Duffy said. ""And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses.""Eva Spiegel, a spokesperson for California's department of motor vehicles, said the Trump administration ""has no legitimate basis"" to withhold federal highway transportation funds. ""The federal govt previously allowed commercial driver's licences for asylum seekers and refugees and on Sept 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on Sept 29.California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law. ""When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licenced commercial drivers.Duffy said California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licences to non-citizens.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M.

The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers.

There’s an old rule in politics: you can lose an election, but never lose the plot.

While Canada debates the price of maple syrup and the future of liberalism, the former prime minister is busy trending for something far more cinematic—his rumoured romance with Katy Perry Yes, that Katy Perry, the pop deity who once sang “I Kissed a Girl” and made an entire generation of millennials question their playlists and sexuality. In a twist that sounds like it was storyboarded by Netflix’s marketing team, she’s apparently been welcomed into the Trudeau household with open arms. His kids, the tabloids coo, are “smitten.” The insiders murmur that Justin is “serious.” The headlines scream “wedding bells. ”But before we cue the fireworks and champagne, there’s an obvious ghost at this glossy banquet: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.Sophie Grégoire wasn’t just Justin’s partner in photo-ops; she was his emotional translator, the one who made the Trudeau brand human. A former TV presenter with a yoga-teacher calm and a charisma that could sell both self-care and social reform, she stood beside him through the selfie years, the scandals, and the slow-motion implosion of Canada’s liberal fairy tale.When they announced their separation in August 2023, the statement was painfully Canadian in its politeness: “After many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate.” No vitriol, no tell-all memoir, no courtroom drama—just the quiet unravelling of a modern marriage conducted under fluorescent political light.Since then, Sophie has retreated from the paparazzi and leaned into purpose. She published a wellness-themed book, Closer Together, in 2024, half memoir and half meditation on mindfulness, and became a sought-after speaker on empathy and mental health. In short, while Justin’s life turned into an internet soap opera, Sophie quietly reinvented herself as the kind of grounded, post-marital heroine Oprah would applaud.Her most recent social media post captures that evolution perfectly. “Real love isn’t about carrying it all. It’s about learning when to give, when to receive, and when to simply be,” she wrote, in a caption that reads more like a closing chapter than a cryptic comment. “Reciprocity means allowing space for both people to grow, to rest, to rediscover themselves within the relationship. Because love that breathes is love that lasts. ” It’s the sort of message that could only come from someone who has made peace with both endings and beginnings.Meanwhile, Justin’s post-political evolution has been less meditative and more MTV Unplugged. Enter Katy Perry: global superstar, part-time activist, and full-time headline magnet. The two were reportedly first seen together in Montreal this summer, later photographed on a California yacht, laughing, cuddling, and giving the internet enough serotonin to last three news cycles.“Justin loves how easily Katy fits in with the family,” said one insider, presumably between spin classes. “His kids adore her.” Another claimed he’s “serious about building something lasting.” The narrative practically writes itself: the widowed prince of progressivism finds solace in the queen of empowerment pop.It’s hard to ignore the political irony. Trudeau, once roasted for being too performative, has now become the star of his own romantic reboot. The man who apologised for blackface, bad pipelines, and budget overruns is finally living in technicolour, and the world can’t look away.So, what did happen to Sophie? The answer, it turns out, is refreshingly normal. She’s thriving—privately. Her social media remains measured and warm, filled with reflections on love, self-worth, and balance. Friends describe her as “at peace.” There’s no bitterness, no back-channel sniping, no quiet PR war.In a culture that monetises every breakup, Sophie’s restraint feels almost radical. She isn’t auditioning for relevance or competing with Perry’s glitter. She’s doing what many political spouses dream of but rarely achieve: reclaiming her narrative.Her latest Instagram post, now viral for its understated grace, seems to say it all: love isn’t ownership; it’s space. A philosophy that, in retrospect, might be the most sophisticated response to her ex-husband’s new chapter.Still, the Perry-Trudeau affair raises a few questions. Not moral ones, but cinematic ones. How does a former world leader date a pop star without turning it into a trailer? What happens when diplomacy meets choreography? Does she serenade him with “Unconditionally” before bedtime? Does he counter with an apology drafted in both English and French?It’s hard not to see the symbolism. Trudeau’s political brand was always part rock concert, part sermon. Perry’s music, too, thrives on idealism and spectacle. Together, they’re a duet of self-reinvention, two brands trying to age gracefully in a world that devours sincerity.And yet, there’s something deeply human here. Two middle-aged public figures, both famous for their performance of authenticity, may have finally stumbled onto the real thing. Perry, who has weathered the exhaustion of pop fame and the chaos of past relationships, reportedly finds Trudeau “grounding.” He, in turn, finds her “vital.”Maybe that’s all it is: two people meeting at the intersection of burnout and belief, trying to write a new story away from the noise.As for Sophie Grégoire, she’s no longer part of that story, but she’s certainly no footnote. If anything, she’s proof that grace after heartbreak is the rarest form of charisma.So what happened to Trudeau’s ex-wife?She moved on—quietly, intelligently, and without hashtags.And that, in the age of yacht selfies and engagement rumours, might just be the most Canadian ending of all.","Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Justin Trudeau announced their separation in August 2023.

Dubai is once again turning into the world’s largest open-air gym as the Dubai Fitness Challenge (DFC) returns from November 1 to 30, 2025. Initiated by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the UAE, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, the month-long movement invites residents and visitors to commit to 30 minutes of activity for 30 days (the 30x30 challenge).

"Saudi's new traffic rule: Prepare to stop at orange light or risk SAR6,000 fine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudis-new-traffic-rule-prepare-to-stop-at-orange-light-or-risk-sar6000-fine/articleshow/124841093.cms,"Why Saudi drivers should treat yellow lights seriously now / AI-generated Image

Saudi traffic rules explained

The SAR 6,000 fine risk you need to know

Practical guidance for drivers

Slow down when you see amber. Treat it as “prepare to stop.” This avoids risky last-second accelerations.

If you’re already past the stop line when amber starts, proceed cautiously, don’t floor it; but understand cameras may capture a red-light crossing if timing lines up.

Don’t use amber as an excuse to speed up or “beat” the light; that behavior is treated as dangerous and can lead to the same penalties as red-light violations.

If fined and you think the ticket is wrong, dispute it through the official MOI/Absher channels automated systems provide evidence and can be reviewed

The takeaway





Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop, not a cue to speed up. While simply passing on amber is not automatically fined, entering or crossing the stop line after the light turns red is treated as a red-light violation carrying steep penalties (SR 3,000–6,000 in severe or repeated cases).The General Directorate of Traffic in Saudi Arabia (Murur) has issued a clear warning to all drivers: the orange (or yellow) traffic light is not a cue to speed up. This transitional light serves a critical safety purpose, marking the final stage before a complete stop. It is meant to be a non-negotiable alert for drivers to immediately begin slowing down. The Murur clarifies that this brief yellow phase is not for aesthetics or a gentle reminder, but a crucial opportunity to prepare for a safe, gradual halt. Ignoring this signal by speeding up or trying to rush through the intersection is classified as a serious driving error. This behavior not only disregards the law but also poses a direct threat to the safety of all road users and their property.The consequences of misinterpreting the orange light can be severe, potentially mirroring the penalties for running a red light. The law views a driver who fails to stop safely during the yellow phase, resulting in them running the subsequent red light, as committing the greater violation.This failure to stop in time can lead to a fine for running a red light, a Category 1 offense. The penalty for this starts at SAR 3,000 and can reach a maximum of SAR 6,000. Furthermore, the fine can be escalated to the maximum amount for repeat offenders or under aggravated conditions. In serious situations, especially if the violation causes an accident with injuries, the driver may face legal accountability and even vehicle impoundment.Keep these straight and simple:The General Directorate of Traffic maintains that strict adherence to all traffic laws is the sole path to safety. By respecting the orange light and the entire signaling system, drivers contribute to protecting lives and property, and ensure a predictable, smooth, and sustainable flow of traffic across the Kingdom's road networks.","Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop.

BIG! Trump To ABANDON 100% Tariffs On China’s Goods Ahead Of Historic Meet With Xi Jinping





Optimism grew Monday that US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping will end their bruising trade war during talks this week, as the US president touched down in Tokyo on the latest leg of an Asian tour.Trump said en route to close US ally Japan that he was hopeful of a deal when he sees Xi on Thursday, while also indicating he was willing to extend his trip in order to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

A motorcyclist accused of fatally shooting a San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy was captured Monday after crashing into another vehicle during a high-speed chase on the 210 Freeway near Ontario.Authorities say the suspect was wanted in connection with a possible domestic violence incident in Rancho Cucamonga. When deputies responded around 1.30 pm (US time), one of them — identified as Deputy Andrew Nunez — was shot and killed, Fox news reported.The gunman fled the scene on a motorcycle, reaching triple-digit speeds and reportedly riding against oncoming traffic multiple times along the 210 Freeway. About five minutes later, the suspect collided with a car on the eastbound lanes near exit 56 in Ontario.Footage from SkyFOX showed the suspect sitting upright in a neck brace, surrounded by law enforcement before being placed on a gurney and airlifted to a hospital. A firearm was visible on the roadway near the crash site.Earlier, a large police presence was seen at an apartment complex on the 12300 block of Hollycock in Rancho Cucamonga — the initial scene of the shooting — where a bloody vest and a patrol vehicle with a shattered window were spotted.The suspect’s condition remains unclear. Officials have not yet released details about his injuries or identity. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.","Authorities say the suspect was wanted in connection with a possible domestic violence incident in Rancho Cucamonga.

President's ‘Too Cute’ Attack On Dems, Leaves Door Open For 3rd Term

Can Trump again run for President?

Can Trump amend the 22nd Amendment?

Has any president ever served more than two terms?





US President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out running for vice president in the 2028 election — but notably stopped short of ruling out a third term, fueling speculation about how he might try to extend his time in office.Trump, 79, has repeatedly teased the idea of serving beyond the constitutionally limited two terms, joking at rallies and even selling “Trump 2028” hats. While most constitutional scholars have dismissed such talk as legally impossible, some of his allies have suggested exploring “creative” ways to make it happen.Under the 22nd Amendment, no one can be elected president more than twice. Some Trump supporters have floated a loophole — that he could run as vice president and then assume office if the elected president resigned. But Trump appeared to reject that idea when speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his flight from Malaysia to Tokyo.“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said. “But I wouldn’t. I think it’s too cute. The people wouldn’t like that. It wouldn’t be right.”Still, Trump left the door open to a future run. Asked whether he was ruling out a third term, he replied, “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever,” adding when pressed, “Am I not ruling it out? You’ll have to tell me.”President Donald Trump has hinted several times that he’d like to extend his stay in the White House — even joking about serving beyond the traditional limit. But could he actually run again in 2028 and seek a third term?The short answer: No. The Constitution bars anyone from being elected president more than twice.The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, clearly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”Kimberly Wehle, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore and author of ""How to Read the Constitution and Why,"" said the amendment leaves no room for ambiguity. “There was a concern about entrenching power in a kinglike manner,” she explained to New York Times.Amending the Constitution would be an extraordinarily difficult task. A proposed amendment requires approval from two-thirds of both the House and Senate — a far higher threshold than the narrow Republican majorities currently in place — or from two-thirds of state legislatures calling for a constitutional convention.Even then, ratification demands support from three-fourths of all state legislatures or constitutional conventions.Just three days after President Trump was sworn in for his second term, Representative Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced a long-shot proposal to amend the Constitution and open a path for a potential third term.His resolution stated: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms.”Ogles argued that Trump needed more time to fulfill his agenda and undo the policies of the Biden administration, saying, “He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation’s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal.”Yes — Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. His presidency spanned the Great Depression and World War II, a period of immense national crisis that made his continued leadership broadly acceptable at the time.There was no 22nd Amendment then, but Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term tenure became the catalyst for introducing formal presidential term limits.“Four terms, or 16 years, is the most dangerous threat to our freedom ever proposed,” warned Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor who ran against Roosevelt in 1944 and later lost to Harry S. Truman in 1948.",President Donald Trump has hinted several times that he’d like to extend his stay in the White House. But could he actually run again in 2028 and seek a third term?

SNAP benefits to end on November 1; air traffic controllers to miss first paychecks — will Trump and Democrats strike a deal to end shutdown?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-snap-benefits-to-end-on-november-1-air-traffic-controllers-to-miss-first-paychecks/articleshow/124861067.cms,"

Will Medicare and Medicaid be affected by the government shutdown?

US shutdown affects air travel

Will lawmakers make peace for Americans





As the US government shutdown drags into its fourth week, millions of Americans are facing the threat of losing food assistance, and air traffic controllers are preparing to miss their first paychecks.The Department of Agriculture says Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will stop on November 1, warning that “the well has run dry, ABC news reported.SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, provides support to about 42 million low-income Americans. The program is federally funded but administered by states, meaning the shutdown’s effects will vary across the country.For now, beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid should still be able to access medical care without disruption. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) confirmed that both programs will continue operating during the shutdown, with Medicaid funding secured through the end of the year, US Today reported.However, experts caution that prolonged gridlock could cause ripple effects. If the shutdown stretches on, doctors, hospitals, and other health providers may begin to experience delays in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid — potentially straining operations and patient services over time.Air travel chaos worsened across the US on Monday as the government shutdown entered its 27th day, with more than 5,600 flights delayed nationwide amid a surge in air traffic controller absences.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) blamed staffing shortages for widespread disruptions, implementing ground delay programs at Newark Liberty International in New Jersey, Austin-Bergstrom in Texas, and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Earlier in the day, flights in the Southeast were also affected by shortages at the Atlanta Terminal Radar Approach Control.Around 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers have been working without pay since the shutdown began, after a funding standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, as per Reuters.Officials have warned that delays and cancellations could worsen as air traffic controllers miss their first full paycheck on Tuesday. On Sunday alone, more than 8,800 flights were delayed nationwide.Secretary of transport department Sean Duffy said that air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting October 28.In a post on X, he said, ""Air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting TOMORROW. This is not ok! I just visited several of them at @goingplacesCLE and they are worried about paying their mortgage. @SenSchumer and @RepJeffriesyou’ve got to do better!""As the shutdown continues to impact Americans and key deadlines loom, all eyes are on Capitol Hill where lawmakers are still in a stalemate.And it seems that President Donald Trump and Democrats are in the negotiating terms, according to the ABC news.Over the weekend, the Trump administration said it will not extend additional funding for SNAP, blaming Democrats for the continued stalemate. The position marks a reversal from a contingency plan published by USDA in September, which suggested that multi-year funds could sustain operations during a shutdown.Democrats are blasting President Donald Trump for refusing to tap into contingency funds to keep food aid flowing during the government shutdown.In a joint statement Friday, Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Angie Craig called the move “perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet.”They also accused Trump of misplaced priorities — pointing to his decision to provide financial assistance to Argentina and fund a new White House ballroom even as millions of Americans face losing access to food assistance.","USDA says food stamps will stop on November 1, warning that ""the well has run dry"" More than 5,600 flights were delayed nationwide on Monday as the government shutdown entered its 27th day.

He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

What is the Dunki route? 50 Haryana men deported from US after chasing a Shah Rukh Khan-style dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-dunki-route-50-haryana-men-deported-from-us-after-chasing-a-shah-rukh-khan-style-dream/articleshow/124857658.cms,"What is the Dunki route?



Dunki Disaster: 50 Haryana Boys Return in Handcuffs, Families Ruined As Agents Disappear After Scam

From hope to heartbreak in Haryana



Trump-era crackdown







At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States. Their pursuit of the “American dream” took them through the infamous dunki route — a perilous, illegal path across continents that promises hope but often ends in heartbreak and jail cells.In Shah Rukh Khan’s 2023 film Dunki, the term symbolises the dangerous journey many Indians take to reach countries like the US, UK, or Canada without proper visas. The story follows four friends from Punjab chasing a better life abroad through smugglers, only to face violence, betrayal, and despair. The film’s mix of humour and tragedy mirrors the real-life struggles of countless migrants who risk everything for foreign dreams on a daily basis.Naresh Kumar, one of 14 deported youths from Kaithal, said he sold his farmland and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to reach the US through Panama’s dense jungles. “I sold my agricultural land and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to go to the US via the Panama jungle route. After spending 14 months in jail, I was deported,” he told reporters.Naresh added that the agent extorted money at every stage. “He took Rs 42 lakh initially, then Rs 6 lakh in Guatemala, another Rs 6 lakh when I reached Mexico, and the rest was taken when we crossed the border.But instead of helping me reach the US safely, they got me arrested and put in jail,” he said, urging others to avoid the dunki route.Officials confirmed that 16 deportees were from Karnal, 14 from Kaithal, five from Kurukshetra, three from Jind, and others from Ambala and Panipat. “The youths were brought from the Delhi airport by CM squad personnel and handed over to their families at the police lines,” said DSP Sandeep Kumar of Karnal.Kaithal SP Upasana added, “All records are being checked thoroughly and one person was found to have a criminal background.”Jind SP Kuldeep Singh warned, “Travelling abroad through the ‘dunki’ route is a serious criminal offence and also tarnishes the image of our society. Such illegal journeys not only lead to financial loss but also pose a grave threat to life. In many cases, youths face physical abuse, fraud, and even death along the way.”Under Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, the dunki dream has turned darker than ever. Across Haryana, families who once hoped for a better life abroad now watch their sons return home in handcuffs, as authorities tighten their grip on illegal migration networks and agents who sell false promises.","At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States.

Chants of “tax the rich” were heard through the crowd. This showed a clear rift within the Democratic Party between moderates and progressives.X users flooded Musk’s replies, with MAGA supporters accusing Mamdani of “pushing communist ideology” and others viewing Musk’s post as an ironic endorsement. Meanwhile, supporters of Mamdani saw the attention as proof that his campaign is cutting through the political noise.The New York mayoral race is heating up, with only days left to decide the fate of one of America’s most populous and wealthiest cities.

Aleena Asif, an Indian-origin woman, was killed by her estranged husband, Asif Qureshi, in Long Island over their ongoing marital dispute. Asif Qureshi was arraigned in a Long Island courtroom Friday, a week after Aleena Asif's body was found asphyxiated with chemical burns to the face at her home in Herricks. Aleena and Qureshi were parents to three children. While Aleena is originally from Mumbai, Qureshi is from Pakistan but a US citizen.Nassau County Police nabbed the husband after he was seen sneaking into the wife's home wearing a mask, hoodie and gloves, hiding and waiting for his wife to return from walking their seven-year-old child to school. As she returned, he attacked her with a chemical mixture, which was a cyanide-like compound. Then Qureshi got away on an e-bike and fled the crime scene.Aleena's 18-year-old daughter raised an alarm and called 911 when she didn't pick up her 7-year-old sister from school. The medical examiner determined she died of asphyxiation by an unknown chemical substance, police said. The incident was ruled a homicide.Police said Aleena tried to leave Qureshi and served him with divorce papers. Qureshi did not accept the papers and started stalking her, showing up at her house.Once, he threatened Aleena that he would make her swallow bleach. Aleena, an accountant, called law enforcement four times with safety concerns.Qureshi, an unemployed software engineer, pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder charge. His attorney called him a good US citizen and provider for his family.According to reports, Qureshi had been arrested before for a 'domestic incident' with Asif, and also had five prior incidents - four with his wife and one with a daughter.","Aleena Asif, an Indian-origin woman, was killed by her estranged husband, Asif Qureshi, in Long Island over their ongoing marital dispute.

2. Trial and split verdict (July 2025)

3. Sentencing scheduled (October 2025)

4. Sentence imposed (3 October 2025)

5. Forecasted release (8 May 2028)

What comes next?







Sean “Diddy” Combs is set to walk out of prison on 8 May 2028, according to the Bureau of Prisons website, following his sentencing for two federal prostitution-related convictions.He is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn, where he has remained since his arrest in September 2024.55-year-old Combs was taken into federal custody following an indictment on charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. A judge denied bail, ruling that “detention is mandatory” given allegations of abuse, violence and risk to the community.On July 2, 2025, a jury found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but cleared him of sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The convictions carried potential sentences of up to 10 years each.Combs’ sentencing date was set for October 3, 2025, after both defence and prosecution agreed. He remained in custody pending the hearing.On that date, Indian-origin judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Combs to four years and two months (50 months) in prison.He also ordered a $500,000 fine and five years of supervised release. The judge acknowledged Combs’ achievements but said a “substantial sentence must be given to send a message to abusers and victims alike.”With his 50-month sentence in place and credit for time already served in detention since September 2024, Combs’ release date is projected to be May 8, 2028. During his term, he may be transferred to a different facility.Combs will serve his time amid ongoing civil lawsuits against him, while his team may pursue appeals or other legal motions. Prosecutors had recommended more than 11 years behind bars, citing his “extensive history of abuse and violence.” His defence argued he should receive no more than 14 months, pointing to the time he had already spent in custody.","Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is set to walk out of prison on 8 May 2028, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.

Japan's new PM has a trump card for Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/japans-new-pm-has-a-trump-card-for-donald-trump-her-friendship-with-abe-san/articleshow/124853878.cms,"Takaichi's 'golden chance' to impress Trump



Trump in Tokyo: What's on the agenda?



The enemy of my enemy is my friend







Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, is preparing for her first meeting with US President Donald Trump this week, and her most powerful diplomatic tool may not be policy but personal history — her deep connection to the late Shinzo Abe, Trump’s closest ally in Asia.Takaichi became Japan’s first female prime minister last week. She will meet Trump in Tokyo on Tuesday as part of his state visit. While she doesn’t share Trump’s love of golf or hamburgers, she is expected to lean on her ties to Abe, her mentor and political role model, to build rapport with the American president.“She will be looking to cloak herself in the mantle of Abe to persuade Trump that she is his woman in Asia and a steadfast partner that he can count on,” said Mira Rapp-Hooper, a partner at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm.Abe was assassinated in 2022 and was widely seen as a master at managing Trump during his first term. The two leaders developed a personal bond over lavish state dinners, golf outings, and mutual admiration. Takaichi, analysts say, has studied Abe’s style closely — and now has a “golden chance” to reset the Japan–US relationship under her leadership.“She has studied how Prime Minister Abe handled President Trump,” said Shinsuke J.Sugiyama, Japan’s former ambassador to Washington. “She learned a lot from him. And if she and President Trump can start talking about how great Shinzo Abe was, I think they won’t be able to disagree on anything.”Trump arrived in Tokyo on Monday and will meet Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace before sitting down with Takaichi for lunch at Akasaka Palace. He is also expected to address American troops stationed in Japan, which hosts more than 50,000 US military personnel.On the agenda are two major issues: trade and defence. Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in the United States, and Takaichi is likely to seek a stronger say in how that money is spent. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to press her to accelerate military spending and deepen Japan’s role in countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.Takaichi has already pledged to raise defence expenditure to 2 per cent of Japan’s GDP by next spring — two years earlier than planned. Her commitment aligns with Trump’s long-standing demand for US allies to shoulder more of their defence costs.Like Abe, Takaichi has also voiced support for Taiwan and warned against China’s militarisation of the South China Sea. Earlier this year, she met Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, to call for stronger security ties, a move that Beijing did not like. Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to publicly congratulate her on her election victory.Analysts believe Takaichi will use the meeting to gauge Trump’s current stance on China and Taiwan. “Japanese officials want to know what the American strategy in the Indo-Pacific is,” said Jeffrey W. Hornung, a Japan expert at the RAND Corporation.Trade will also be high on the agenda. In July, Japan secured a 15 per cent tariff on exports, lower than the rate initially threatened by the Trump administration, in exchange for its large-scale investment commitment. Both sides are still negotiating the finer details of how that money will be channelled into investments and loan guarantees.","Takaichi became Japan’s first female prime minister last week.

Trump’s $350M ‘Presidential Ballroom’ Mystery Sends D.C. Into Frenzy; What’s He Really Building?

Windows opening onto one another





Donald Trump's ballroom design is in flux as bizarre architectural flaws emerge in the designs released so far. The construction was slated to begin in September, is supposed to be completed before the end of Trump's term. Plans shared by the MAGA administration suggest “a hurried process,” the New York Times reported, pointing out the technical flaws that were found in the miniature model unveiled Wednesday.The model showed a staircase leading up from the South Lawn, but it reaches nowhere and hits a wall.Another bizarre feature was a window that appears to open out onto another window.Last Monday, the White House started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Donald Trump’s $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room.He noted the work was happening “right behind us.”The administration has dismissed attacks on the project as “manufactured outrage.” Donald Trump Jr. has rebuffed critiques from members of the Clinton family by pointing out scandals during their time in the White House. The Trump team also updated a page on the official White House website to include a timeline of “major events.” The timeline largely consists of significant construction projects, but Trump aides added in then-President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky; the discovery of cocaine in the building during the Biden administration; and a 2023 Trans Day of Visibility celebration at which one attendee was topless.“We’ve been keeping you apprised of this project. We’ve shown you the renderings. And if you look at the renderings, it’s very clear the East Wing was going to be modernized,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.","The White House started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Donald Trump’s $250 million ballroom.

President's ‘Too Cute’ Attack On Dems, Leaves Door Open For 3rd Term





US President Donald Trump brushed aside growing speculation about seeking a third term in office, calling the idea “too cute” and “not right,” even as some of his MAGA allies push the idea that he could return to power again in 2028.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Japan on Monday, the GOP leader said he would technically be “allowed” to run as vice president in 2028 and then assume the presidency if the elected president resigned. However, he dismissed the idea outright, reports Alabama News.“Yeah, I’d be allowed to do that. But I wouldn’t do that. I think it’s too cute. Yeah, I’d rule that out because it’s too cute. I think people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute. It wouldn’t be right,” Trump said.The US Constitution restricts presidents to two terms in office. The rule is not taken well among Trump’s supporters, who continue to float alternative theories that could allow Trump to lead again.Last week, Steve Bannon, Trump’s 2016 campaign chief and former White House adviser, insisted that Trump “will be president in 2028.” Speaking to The Economist, Bannon said, “There’s many different alternatives.At the appropriate time we’ll lay out what the plan is. But there’s a plan, and President Trump will be president in 2028.”Trump appeared to distance himself from that claim, saying the Republican Party would be “in good shape” without him on the ticket. He praised secretary of state Marco Rubio and vice president JD Vance as strong contenders for 2028.“Well, we have great people. I don’t have to get into that. But we have one of them standing here. We have JD, obviously. The vice president is great. I think Marco’s great. I’m not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they formed a group, they would be unstoppable,” Trump said.Still, the POTUS could not resist boasting about his continued popularity. “I would love to do it. I have the best numbers ever,” he said, before taking aim at potential Democratic challengers. He called opposition representatives Jasmine Crockett and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “low IQ” figures and mocked their intelligence.“They have Jasmine Crockett – a low IQ person. AOC’s a low IQ. You give her an IQ test, have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. They’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way. But they’re cognitive tests,” he said.",US President Donald Trump dismissed the idea that he could run for a third term in 2028.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

Rising tensions along the border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks in Istanbul collapse, according to a report by TOLO News. The discussions are aimed at defusing weeks of cross-border tensions and deadly clashes between the two countries.Speaking to reporters, Asif said there had been no fresh incidents along the border in recent days, suggesting that the Doha Agreement had been “somewhat effective.” However, he cautioned that the calm could be temporary if diplomacy fails to resolve long-standing disputes. Afghan officials have not yet responded to his remarks.Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks, which focus on strengthening the Doha Agreement, preventing cross-border attacks, and restoring bilateral trust. According to TOLO News, the negotiations are centred on four key issues: creating a joint border monitoring system, ensuring mutual respect for sovereignty, addressing Pakistan’s long-standing security concerns, and lifting trade barriers.The dialogue also includes discussions on halting the forced deportation of Afghan refugees and preventing the refugee issue from becoming politicised. Pakistan recently began demolishing refugee camps in Balochistan, displacing thousands of Afghans. Camps in Loralai, Gardi Jungle, Saranan, Zhob, Qala-e-Saifullah, Pishin, and Muslim Bagh were cleared, with residents saying they were forced out abruptly without time to collect their belongings.Asif reminded reporters that Pakistan had supported Afghanistan “for decades” by sheltering millions of migrants. “We have stood by them through the hardest times,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s patience was running thin after continued militant attacks allegedly originating from Afghan soil.The Istanbul talks follow the first round of negotiations held in Doha on October 18 and 19, jointly mediated by Qatar and Turkiye. During those meetings, both sides agreed to an “immediate ceasefire” after intense border clashes that killed dozens.Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time that the follow-up discussions in Turkiye were meant to ensure “the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner.”“A round of negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Doha, mediated by the State of Qatar and the Republic of Turkiye. During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” the Qatari statement said.The flare-up between Islamabad and Kabul earlier this month began after Pakistan demanded that the Taliban government take stronger action against militants launching attacks from inside Afghanistan. In response, Pakistan carried out cross-border airstrikes, leading to heavy exchanges of fire that killed and injured dozens on both sides.Taliban officials, however, rejected Islamabad’s claims. The Islamic Emirate said Afghan territory “is not being used to attack Pakistan” and that it “does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Kabul insisted it remains committed to maintaining peace and regional stability.Despite recent calm, Pakistan’s warning of an “open war” has reignited concerns of a potential escalation between the two neighbours, who share deep historical, ethnic, and economic ties but remain divided over border security, militancy, and the treatment of refugees.The outcome of the Istanbul talks is expected to determine whether the fragile ceasefire holds or if the region faces yet another round of hostilities.(With inputs from ANI and TOLO news)","Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks collapse.

Tensions Escalate As Pakistan-Taliban Trade Warnings After Heavy Clashes Along Afghanistan Border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Saturday said that while Afghanistan appears to want peace, failure to reach a lasting agreement during ongoing talks in Istanbul could lead to “open war”.The discussions, which began on Saturday and are expected to continue into Sunday, follow deadly border clashes earlier this month, marking the latest effort by both sides to prevent a relapse into violence since the Taliban ’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.As quoted by news agency Reuters, Asif said in televised remarks, “We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them. But I saw that they want peace.”The clashes erupted after Islamabad demanded the Taliban curb militants it says have been attacking Pakistan from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.Pakistan responded with cross-border airstrikes, and both sides exchanged heavy fire, killing dozens and prompting the closure of key crossings, which remain shut.The talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.“There have been no incidents in the four to five days since it was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce,” Asif said, underlining the delicate situation along the 2,640-km Durand Line border.Earlier, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly clashes, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry, which said both sides also agreed to establish mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability.The violence, which began on October 11, followed Pakistani airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika targeting groups linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Amid the tensions, the Taliban government has ordered construction of a dam on the Kunar River to limit Pakistan’s water supply, according to RT, escalating non-military pressure on Islamabad and adding another layer to the strained bilateral relations.","Talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.

Toronto Conference Highlights Pakistan’s Human Rights Violations In Balochistan, Sindh And KPK





Pakistan’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, has reinforced a woman’s right to dissolve her marriage through Khula—an Islamic provision that allows a woman to seek divorce independently.The decision came after a woman challenged the Peshawar High Court’s rejection of her dissolution request. The PHC had denied her petition, stating that her husband’s consent was necessary and that all efforts at reconciliation had not been exhausted.The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Naeem Afghan, ruled that the PHC’s decision was incorrect and reinstated the Family Court’s decree of dissolution. The court clarified that Khula is a voluntary right of the wife and cannot be made conditional upon the husband’s consent or judicial discretion.Justice Malik, who authored the judgment, wrote, as quoted by PTI, “The Family Court's role is not to force a woman to stay in a marriage where there is no harmony or substance.”The ruling also marks a significant step in recognising psychological abuse — including humiliation, neglect, intimidation, and emotional abuse — as valid grounds for seeking divorce under Islamic law.“Cruelty need not always manifest in physical violence,” the judgment stated. The court emphasised that mental cruelty can be as damaging as physical abuse, and a woman’s emotional well-being should be taken into account when assessing the viability of a marriage.The Supreme Court criticised the patriarchal interpretations used by lower courts, which limited women’s agency and autonomy. It cited Articles 14, 25, and 35 of the Constitution, which guarantee dignity, equality before the law, and protection of the family, emphasising that the right to seek Khula embodies these guarantees.The court restored the Family Court’s decree of dissolution, recognising the petitioner’s right to seek divorce on the grounds of second marriage and psychological cruelty. It also ruled that the petitioner would retain her dower, including the gold, money, and property given at the time of marriage.",Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds a woman's right to dissolve her marriage through Khula.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district, near Dera Ismail Khan.The explosion occurred after unidentified attackers planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall and beneath several classrooms. The early morning blast tore through the nearly completed building, causing extensive damage, as reported by The Dawn.Police said a bomb disposal unit later inspected the site, collected evidence, and assessed the extent of the destruction.The motive and those responsible for the bombing are yet to be identified.The blast sparked concern in the local community, with residents urging provincial authorities to rebuild the school immediately and strengthen security at educational institutions in the area.They also warned that if the attackers were not arrested soon, they would stage protests to demand justice.""This is not just an attack on a school; it's an attack on the future of our daughters,"" said a local elder, as cited by ANI.The repeated attacks on educational facilities in Pakistan’s northwestern regions highlight ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety of learning spaces, particularly those for girls.Earlier this year, another under-construction government girls’ primary school in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast carried out by unidentified militants.Police said the explosives were planted inside the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel, Bannu district, and detonated with a powerful blast that caused significant structural damage.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time, as cited by PTI.As per a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls’ schools were destroyed in Pakistan’s tribal areas between 2007 and 2017, with teachers and students often targeted.Before Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale operation in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had carried out hundreds of attacks on girls’ schools across the tribal belt and settled districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, operating from its stronghold in Swat district.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from school after sixth grade and barred women from universities.The Pakistani Taliban, aligned with the Afghan group, are trying to enforce similar anti-education rules in Pakistan’s tribal areas by force.",Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district.

9/11 attacks: Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped to Pakistan disguised as woman





In a startling revelation, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said that Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan disguised as a woman after the September 11 attacks Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA and headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan , was speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI.He claimed that US forces believed they had cornered bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders in October 2001.The CIA did not realize that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an Al-Qaeda operative. Believing bin Laden was cornered, US forces told him to come down the mountain, but through the translator, he requested time until dawn to evacuate women and children before surrendering.“We told him to come down the mountain. He said through the translator, ‘Can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we’ll come down and give up,’” Kiriakou said.He added: “What ended up happening was bin Laden dressed as a woman and he escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,” Kiriakou said.By dawn, Tora Bora was empty, forcing the US to shift operations into Pakistan.The former officer said that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States initially reacted cautiously.“First, the United States was reactive at the time rather than proactive.We waited a month until we had proper buildup in the region, and then we began attacking known Al-Qaeda sites, mostly in the Pashto areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan,” Kiriakou explained.Kiriakou also discussed the role of Pakistan in the operation. At the time, US relations with Pakistan were reportedly strong under then-President Pervez Musharraf .“Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. We essentially just purchased Musharraf… he would let us do whatever we wanted to do,” Kiriakou said.He highlighted that Pakistan’s military had its own priorities, focusing more on India than on counterterrorism, allowing extremists to operate while pretending to cooperate with the US.The former CIA officer further revealed early links between Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. During a raid in Lahore in March 2002, US forces captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters along with an Al-Qaeda training manual.“It was the very first time we could attach the Pakistani government to Al-Qaeda,” Kiriakou said, emphasizing how this discovery highlighted the broader regional threats.Kiriakou admitted that strategic decisions were heavily influenced by US interests in Pakistan.“The relationship with Pakistan was bigger than India, at least temporarily. We needed them more than they needed us. We really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,” he said.He also spoke about the eventual tracking of bin Laden. The terrorist leader was found in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by US special forces on May 2, 2011.Reflecting on the overall counterterrorism efforts, Kiriakou said the initial failure to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora underscored the complexities of intelligence, infiltration and regional politics.“We thought we had him cornered, but the combination of deception, local dynamics, and strategic constraints meant the fight had to shift to Pakistan proper,” he said, giving a rare insight into the operational and political challenges faced by the US in the early years after 9/11.",Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora disguised as a woman.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

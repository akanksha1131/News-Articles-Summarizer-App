But Bengali poet Tagore captured it the best when he wrote 'Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark.' Diwali is about the idea that light will push back against darkness.""""A decade later, this annual gathering has become a tradition, one I am very proud of and pleased to continue,"" Blinken said, noting the vast global celebrations with over a billion Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs marking Diwali with vibrant decorations, rangoli, and the lighting of diyas.Blinken commemorated a decade of celebrating the festival of lights within the department, a tradition first introduced by then-secretary John Kerry.Addressing the gathering on Friday, Blinken expressed pride in continuing the annual celebration and highlighted Diwali’s universal message of hope and resilience.Blinken also celebrated the profound contributions of Americans of South Asian descent, highlighting how they have enriched the cultural and social fabric of the United States. “Diwali is a reminder of the many ways South Asian culture—and Americans of South Asian descent—have strengthened our nation,” he said, naming prominent figures like vice president Kamala Harris, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma.

Donald Trump Gay Supporters: Gay Trump supporter explains why Trump has 'normal gays',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/normal-gay-guys-for-trump-vance-and-rogan-claim-lgbtq-support-in-push-for-autonomy/articleshow/114846969.cms,"Joe Rogan and JD Vance (Picture Credit:X)

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump 's 2024 running mate, JD Vance , recently appeared on Joe Rogan 's podcast, engaging in a candid discussion on LGBTQ+ rights and broader cultural topics. During the conversation, Vance expressed his belief that he and Trump could capture the support of ""normal gay guys"" due to their emphasis on individual autonomy , especially in areas involving medical interventions.Addressing the current discourse around gender and sexual identity, Vance voiced concerns about pharmaceutical interventions for children exploring gender transitions, suggesting that many Americans, including gay individuals, are uncomfortable with such practices. Vance pointed to a growing desire within the community to maintain personal freedom and avoid medical procedures that he believes are becoming more socially pressured.In response to this conversation, an X user shared their perspective on the LGBTQ+ policies enacted under Trump, contrasting them with what they described as divisive policies from the current administration. The user highlighted Trump’s record on gay rights , noting that he appointed the first openly gay cabinet member, Richard Grenell, and initiated a drive to end HIV/AIDS transmission by 2030. They emphasised Trump’s efforts to expand access to PrEP, a preventive treatment for HIV, and his UN address advocating the decriminalisation of homosexuality worldwide.Moreover, the user said that Trump's administration extended IVF coverage to gay families and proposed an expanded child tax credit for families across the spectrum. They called these moves a ""strong foundation"" for the LGBTQ+ community, contending that Trump’s policies provide tangible support.By contrast, the user criticised current Democratic policies that promote taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries and initiatives like ""tampons in boys’ bathrooms,"" as well as measures allowing boys to compete in girls' sports. They suggested that such policies are out of step with mainstream gay values, labelling them as “pandering” rather than supportive. For many ""commonsense gay men,"" the user concluded, Trump’s approach aligns more closely with their priorities.","Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's 2024 running mate, JD Vance, recently appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, engaging in a candid discussion on LGBTQ+ rights and broader cultural topics.

Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? 10 charts to explain who Indian-Americans are likely to vote for in 2024 US elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/kamala-harris-or-donald-trump-10-charts-to-explain-who-indian-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-in-2024-us-elections/articleshow/114844660.cms,"Mixed bag of sentiments for Harris

Key poll issues



Healthcare and economy: Like many other voters, Indian-Americans prioritise domestic issues such as healthcare and economic stability over foreign policy concerns. These ""kitchen table"" issues dominate their electoral considerations.

Abortion and reproductive rights: Abortion rights have emerged as a significant concern for many voters within this community, particularly among women. The survey indicates that reproductive rights rank as a vital issue for Indian Americans, influencing their support for candidates like Harris.

Gender divide: A pronounced gender gap exists within voting preferences. While 67% of Indian-American women plan to vote for Harris, only 53% of men express similar intentions. This division highlights differing priorities between genders, with men increasingly leaning towards Republican candidates like Donald Trump .

Increasing Republican interest

Perception of economic policies: Some Indian-American voters are drawn to Republican economic policies that emphasize lower taxes and business-friendly regulations.

Cultural resonance: Trump's strong stance on immigration and his populist rhetoric may resonate with certain segments of the Indian-American community, particularly younger men who are increasingly aligning with conservative values.

How Indian-Americans are likely to vote

Democratic commitment declines: Indian Americans remain predominantly Democratic, with 47% identifying as Democrats, a decrease from 56% in 2020. The proportion of independents has increased, indicating a shift in political alignment within the community.

Support for Kamala Harris: 61% of registered Indian American voters plan to support Kamala Harris in the upcoming election, while 32% intend to vote for Donald Trump. This marks a modest increase in Republican support compared to previous elections.

Emerging gender gap: A significant gender gap exists in voting preferences, with 67% of Indian American women supporting Harris, compared to only 53% of men. Conversely, 22% of women and 39% of men plan to vote for Trump, highlighting differing priorities among genders.

Mixed views on Indian-American Republicans: Indian-Americans generally hold lukewarm views towards prominent Indian-American Republicans like Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party.

and , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party. Abortion as a key issue: Abortion and reproductive rights are crucial issues for Indian-Americans this election cycle, ranking it as their second-most-important policy concern, especially among Democrats and women.

Policy discrepancies drive Republican disadvantage: The Republican Party's struggles with Indian-American voters stem from policy misalignments, particularly regarding issues like minority rights and abortion, which many community members find incompatible with Republican stances.

With just days to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Indian-Americans, who constitute a significant and growing demographic in the electorate, are poised to play a crucial role in determining the outcome. With approximately 5.2 million Indian-Americans in the US, around 2.6 million of whom are eligible voters, their political preferences are increasingly influential, particularly in key battleground states.Historically, Indian-Americans have leaned heavily towards the Democratic Party. However, recent surveys indicate a notable shift in this allegiance.According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian-Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020. This drop suggests a growing discontent with the Democratic Party, particularly among younger voters and men within the community.The support for Kamala Harris , the Democratic candidate and current vice president of Indian descent, is also showing signs of decline.Approximately 61% of Indian-American respondents expressed their intention to vote for Harris , which reflects a decrease of nearly 7 percentage points compared to Joe Biden 's support in 2020.This trend may indicate that while Harris's candidacy initially galvanised enthusiasm among Indian-Americans, it has not sustained the same level of support as seen in previous elections.The response of the Indian-American community to Kamala Harris is characterised by a blend of excitement about representation and cautious skepticism based on broader political concerns.Many Indian-Americans are excited about Harris due to her Indian heritage, which resonates deeply within the community, but Indian-Americans do not vote as a monolithic bloc.A significant portion remains aligned with the Republican Party, and many are not swayed by Harris’s candidacy. For instance, some Republican supporters express skepticism regarding her commitment to issues important to them, such as immigration reform.Some community members also feel that Harris downplays her Indian identity in favor of her African American heritage.As the election approaches, her ability to bridge these sentiments will be crucial in securing their votes amidst a diverse array of perspectives within this influential demographic.Several factors are also influencing the voting behavior of Indian Americans this election cycle:Interestingly, there is a growing interest among Indian-Americans in Republican candidates.Support for Trump has risen to 31%, reflecting a modest increase compared to previous elections. Factors contributing to this shift include:The study suggests that the Indian-American community continues to show strong support for the Democratic Party, particularly for candidates like Kamala Harris, but that there are notable shifts that could influence electoral outcomes.The decline in Democratic identification and the rising interest in Republican candidates, especially among younger men, suggest a potential realignment that both parties must heed.As Indian-Americans solidify their role as a pivotal voting bloc, their decisions in the 2024 elections will not only impact local and national races but also reflect broader trends in American politics, making it essential for candidates to understand and address the unique perspectives of the influential community.","According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian- Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020.

JD Vance on Indian Food: What JD Vance said about Indian vegetarian food,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-i-first-started-dating-usha-what-jd-vance-said-about-indian-vegetarian-food/articleshow/114841564.cms,"Joe Rogan Experience #2221 - JD Vance

US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine , on his apperience on The Joe Rogan Experience . The conversation with Joe Rogan, which spanned three hours, offered insights not only into Vance's culinary journey but also into his marriage to Usha Vance .Rogan began the exchange by voicing scepticism about heavily processed plant-based meats, labelling them ""highly processed garbage"" and highlighting the health and environmental concerns often attached to such products. Instead, he championed traditional vegetarian food, specifically Indian cuisine, as a healthier and more flavourful option. “If you want to eat vegetables and be vegetarian, eat Indian food. They make really delicious vegetarian food,” Rogan stated.Vance, quick to agree, shared how his wife’s Indian heritage has opened him up to a world of vegetarian dishes he previously hadn’t considered. ""I'm married to an Indian-American . They make very good vegetarian food,"". As a self-described “meat and potatoes guy from Ohio,” Vance admitted that his initial forays into cooking for his wife were less than successful. Recalling an early attempt at impressing Usha with a homemade vegetarian meal, he said, ""I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes."" The result, he admitted, was ""disgusting.""Vance explained that he initially struggled to grasp what vegetarian meals could look like, particularly when he tried to cater to Usha’s preferences. Over time, he came to appreciate the wide variety and depth of flavours in Indian vegetarian cooking. ""If you're any vegetarian, eat paneer and rice and delicious chickpeas. Do not eat this disgusting fake meat,"" he remarked.Vance, a Catholic convert, has previously spoken about his respect for his wife’s Hindu upbringing, noting the nuances and compromises each has made in their relationship. In a prior interview with The New York Times, he expressed mixed emotions about introducing Usha to his faith, explaining that while she encouraged his spiritual journey, she has not converted to Catholicism herself. “She thought that [Catholic teachings] were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” Vance revealed. He acknowledged feeling “kind of bad” about the change, explaining how Usha has had to shoulder responsibilities, particularly in church with their three children, even though she wasn’t raised in the faith.Their relationship, which began at Yale Law School and led to marriage in 2014.","US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine.

Kamala Harris will boost India-US ties if elected President: Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-will-boost-india-us-ties-if-elected-president-congressman-raja-krishnamoorthi/articleshow/114869372.cms,"Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi expressed confidence about the current vice president Kamala Harris ’s chances in the upcoming Presidential elections . He believes that the democratic candidate will be facing a tight race but will ultimately win.Krishnamoorthi told ANI, ""It's going to be an extremely close election. I think that she's going to ultimately prevail. But as you know, we're going to be looking at six or seven states very closely on election night. Some of those results may not roll in entirely on election night. We're also going to have to be patient as votes get counted. The last time in 2020, it took a week or so for more clarity about each state. We just have to counsel patience... Concerning the election, there's an old saying in Washington, DC if you don't have a seat at the table, you're on the menu. The best way to pull up your proverbial seat to the table is to make sure you vote. Please vote if you're eligible to vote.""Reflecting on the ties between two nations post elections, Krishnamoorthi said that owing to Indian roots through her mother, Harris will go on to be the first ‘Desi’ President, who would further nurture these relations.He stated that if Donald Trump returns to the office, his presidency will likely be marked by a transactional foreign policy in which public disagreements over trade and market access will need to be balanced against strategic priorities.Harris, in contrast, in the same way as President Joseph Biden, will be more dedicated towards strategic convergences, viewing India as the ideal counterbalance to China and ensuring that differences do not escalate into significant divides.However, many, including the Congressman, predict that both candidates will advocate for a strong India-US relationship.""About India, regardless of who is elected as the president, the relationship with India is growing stronger. It's covering more subjects, it's growing deeper. It's going to go to higher heights over time. Kamala Harris, as the first 'Desi' President of the United States, would help to strengthen those bonds. She's visited India so many times as a child and a young adult, given that her mom came from India and instilled those values,"" Krishnamoorthi said.A meme circulating on messaging apps and social media has gained considerable attention, suggests that in Sanskrit, 'Kamala' means lotus, while in America, it means POTUS—President of the United States.The whole Kamala Presidential scenario has gained significant momentum among the Indian American community , which has now grown up to be the second largest immigrant population in the US.These immigrants are transforming states like Texas and Georgia rather than predominantly settling in traditional South Asian strongholds such as California and New York.Despite the possibility of Harris becoming the first Indian American president of the US, a survey by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace indicated that she may receive fewer votes from the community than incumbent President Joe Biden did in 2020.It revealed that approximately 61 percent of respondents from the community plan to vote for Harris, indicating a decrease of nearly 4 percent compared to the last presidential election in 2020. There has been a decline in the community's attachment to Harris's party as well, with 47 per cent of respondents identifying as Democrats, down from 56 per cent in 2020.The researchers also noted ""a modest shift in the community's preferences"", with a slight increase in the willingness to vote for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.The Congressman further stated that Indian American voters will have a huge influence on the Presidential elections. He emphasized that while there is bound to be a 'diversity of opinions,' the community as a whole shares certain beliefs that unify them.He said, ""I still think that Indian Americans believe in a few things that unify us as a community. They should hold their elected officials accountable for fulfilling that kind of unified agenda.""Talking about unifying principles, he said that the community supports a legal immigration system seeking elected officials to advocate for reforms in this area. He emphasized belief in public education, noting that most community members are products of it and see it as the gateway to the American dream.He also highlighted the importance of entrepreneurship and small business innovation, aiming to ensure that the country remains a place where entrepreneurs can start their ventures, succeed, and contribute to their communities.These principles, he said, are widely shared among Indian Americans, and he hopes they will hold their elected officials accountable for upholding them.","Krishnamoorthi said that owing to Indian roots through her mother, Harris will go on to be the first ‘Desi’ President, who would further nurture these relations.

Jobs They’d Once Filled Have Mostly Gone Missing

States That Once Were Factory Hubs Are Poll Battlegrounds

Status Check?

In 1980, white men in US who hadn’t been to college earned more than the average American worker. That has changed since. College-educated women earn more today with the US economy now focused less on manufacturing and more on services and knowledge work. Women without a college degree still round off the bottom of the payment pyramid, though.No matter the racial group, men without a college degree “have fallen well below the average full-time worker (women without a degree have long been at the bottom in income, and college-educated men have consistently been at the top)”, says New York Times.Manufacturing jobs that needed workers to man the line on busy factory ﬂoors today make up a “shrinking share of what the average American worker does”, says NYT. Roles in ﬁnancial analysis and software development have consistently paid more in the past few decades. For those without a college degree now, service-sector jobs like cook, maid, etc, offer more well-paying prospects than factories or clerical roles. “There was a clear division between winners and losers in the economy, and the losers were blue-collar white men largely,” Tom Kochan, who studied union work at MIT, was quoted as saying by NYT.California and New York, both coastal states, represent geographies that have seen the highest growth in earnings. The biggest drops were suffered by those in the so-called ‘ rust belt ’ — once the beating heart of US manufacturing — comprising states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These, along with a handful of other swing states, are expected to decide which way the poll goes as the contest is narrowest here. And it is the Republicans who have gained ground.“We were the party of the middle class and working hard [people] and unions,” Lisa Boscola, a Democratic state senator in Pennsylvania, told NYT. “But something went wrong.” She noted that during her father’s time, it would have been unthinkable for a union worker to vote Republican in their part of Pennsylvania. NYT says that Democrats have lost support among white voters in “places most affected by job losses”. It says that “college-educated voters have increasingly moved towards the Democratic Party, as voters without a college degree have voted more Republican”.NYT said that Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ pitch resonates with a certain section of voters for whom the issue is not so much a drop in earnings, but a decline in social standing and future prospects. “Many voters who turned to Trump were middle income, not poor. But that doesn’t mean economic factors didn’t matter... rightwing populism across Western democracies doesn’t necessarily appeal to those with the lowest incomes, but to those who are downwardly mobile,” it said.","In 1980, white men in US who hadn’t been to college earned more than the average American worker. That has changed since with the US economy now focused less on manufacturing and more on services and knowledge work. Women without a college degree still round off the bottom of the payment pyramid, though.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114868352,imgsize-67606,width-400,resizemode-4/114868352.jpg"
"US elections in November, power transfer in January: Why is there an 11-week transition period?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-in-november-power-transfer-in-january-why-is-there-an-11-week-transition-period/articleshow/114867775.cms,"Constitution and the 20th Amendment:



Electoral college:



The United States has a unique electoral calendar: citizens vote for the president in November, yet the new leader is inaugurated only in January. While many countries quickly transition to new leadership after elections, the US takes a more deliberate approach, allowing an 11-week period between election day and inauguration . This span, though seemingly lengthy, is shorter than the four-month wait originally permitted under the Constitution for the transfer of power.Federal elections are held on the first Tuesday of November, a date that traces back to the early 19th century. Initially, states held elections on different days, but in 1845, a law established a uniform election day across the country. This choice of early November was practical for the largely agricultural society of the time, as it followed the harvest season but still allowed for reasonable weather for travel. Religious and logistical considerations also influenced the timing: Sunday was widely observed as a day of worship, Wednesday was a market day, and polling locations often required long travel, especially from rural areas. Ultimately, Tuesday became the most feasible choice for Election Day.Originally, the Constitution set March 4 as the presidential inauguration date, allowing a four-month "" lame duck "" period between election and inauguration. The term ""lame duck"" refers to an official whose successor has already been elected, diminishing their political influence. However, during the Great Depression, this extended transition proved to be an obstacle to urgent national needs. In response, the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933, moving Inauguration Day to January 20, thereby reducing the transition to under three months.The transition period allows for a seamless transfer of power, giving the president-elect time to prepare for governance by assembling a cabinet, developing policy strategies, and addressing pressing national concerns. It also provides an opportunity for continuity and effective coordination, as the incoming administration works to lay the groundwork for its agenda.This interval is also influenced by the Electoral College system, which finalises the presidential election outcome weeks after the popular vote. In contrast to parliamentary systems, where the winning party can assume power immediately, the US system includes a formal process in December when electors cast their votes. While this additional step delays the formal start of the new president’s term, it ensures a thorough review and verification of the election outcome.The November election date offers voters time to participate and officials time to validate results, while the January inauguration allows for an organised transition of governance and aligns with the Constitution’s evolved timeline.","The United States has a unique electoral calendar: citizens vote for the president in November, yet the new leader is inaugurated only in January.

Two days after Peanut the Squirrel was taken from his home in Pine City, New York, he was euthanized by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the Chemung County Department of Health. Peanut was a beloved pet of content creator Mark Longo and has 534,000 Instagram followers.Officials announced on Friday that Peanut and Raccoon were both seized from a residence on Wednesday and had been euthanized to test for rabies. The statement said a person involved in the confiscation investigation was bitten by the squirrel.Peanut, or ""PNUT,"" was rescued seven years ago by Longo, after Peanut's mother was killed by a car. Longo, who couldn’t find a shelter to take him in, raised Peanut from infancy, and the squirrel later became a social media sensation .Longo showcased Peanut's entire life on social media with 1,400 Instagram posts, showing him eating waffles, jumping through hula-hoops, and bonding with Longo and his cat, Chloe.In response to Peanut's confiscation, fans created a Change.org petition and GoFundMe campaign, gathering over 28,000 signatures and raising nearly $8,000 to support efforts to bring him home. However, the DEC adhered to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines requiring euthanasia forrabies testing , which involves examining brain tissue. There are no approved methods for testing live animals for rabies.DEC officials reminded the public that it is illegal to keep wild animals as pets, stating that young animals raised by humans often develop an abnormal attachment, which can make reintroduction into the wild difficult and dangerous. They encourage contacting licensed wildlife rehabilitators for any injured or orphaned wildlife.Longo, devastated by Peanut's loss, shared updates on Peanut’s Instagram account, calling the experience a ""terrible nightmare."" In addition to Peanut, Longo runs P'Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary in Pine City, where he cares for neglected animals, including horses, cows, alpacas, and a pig.The DEC and health department advised that anyone who had contact with Peanut or the raccoon consult a physician due to potential rabies exposure.","Peanut was a beloved pet of content creator Mark Longo and has 534,000 Instagram followers.

"Donald Trump's old friend Jeffrey Epstein lived in ‘fear’ when he was President, claims author Michael Wolff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-old-friend-jeffrey-epstein-lived-in-fear-when-he-was-president-claims-author-michael-wolff/articleshow/114867217.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump (File photo)

Author Michael Wolff , who conducted extensive interviews with Jeffrey Epstein revealed that the disgraced financier lived in “fear” of his former friend Donald Trump during the latter's presidency.Wolff, who previously included Epstein as a source in his best-selling book Fire and Fury , disclosed these insights shortly before the 2024 presidential election .Epstein, a multimillionaire convicted sex offender , died in a federal jail cell in August 2019, just weeks after his arrest on child sex-trafficking charges.Wolff, who has broken years of silence on the topic, alleged that Epstein showed him photos of Trump with topless young women in his lap during their interviews. These conversations, recorded over an estimated 100 hours, provided a glimpse into Epstein's complex relationship with Trump.Wolff stated on his podcast, Fire and Fury, that Epstein expressed disbelief over Trump's election to the presidency, describing him as “utterly preoccupied” with Trump and “afraid of him.” The author noted that their relationship dated back to the late 1980s, with both men bonding and competing over wealth and women. “I think Epstein saw Trump as essentially Bush League,” Wolff said, highlighting their shared lifestyle as “playboys.”Wolff recounted how both men “shared” the same girlfriend at one point, describing a culture of “sexual excess and license” prevalent among wealthy individuals like Trump and Epstein. However, Wolff claimed Epstein came to believe that Trump was behind law enforcement's investigation into him in 2005, suggesting that Trump was aware of Epstein's activities with underage girls due to his frequent presence in Epstein's world.The fallout between the two men occurred in 2004 when Epstein expressed interest in purchasing the Maison de L’Amitie estate next to Mar-a-Lago . According to Wolff, Trump went behind Epstein's back to bid on the property, resulting in significant tension. Wolff recounted Epstein saying he became “really, really, really p---ed” and began threatening lawsuits and press exposure, leading to his legal troubles.Sources from the Trump camp have countered Wolff’s claims, asserting that Trump had expelled Epstein from Mar-a-Lago upon learning of the sex-trafficking allegations . In 2019, The Washington Post reported on the bitter bidding war between Trump and Epstein for the estate.During their 2017 interviews, Wolff noted that Epstein exhibited genuine fear of Trump, particularly with him as president. “But I couldn’t help but feeling that there was a level of personal fear there,” Wolff remarked. He also stated that several people close to Epstein corroborated this sentiment, with Epstein believing Trump was capable of anything due to his lack of scruples.Despite urging Epstein to publicly share his story, Wolff reported that Epstein dismissed the idea, believing Wolff was naive about how the real world operated. Reflecting on Epstein's controversial death, Wolff described the circumstances of his suicide as “implausible” but suggested that the idea of murder would require extensive silence among many individuals.This revelation from Wolff comes amid the current political climate, with Trump’s campaign denouncing the author's claims as baseless fabrications intended to undermine the upcoming election. A Trump spokesperson labelled Wolff a “disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books.”","Author Michael Wolff conducted extensive interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.

"Cleared path for 9,000 votes: US Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to block provisional ballots in Pennsylvania",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cleared-path-for-9000-votes-us-supreme-court-rejects-gop-bid-to-block-provisional-ballots-in-pennsylvania/articleshow/114865789.cms,"Representative image (Pic credit: Reuters)

The Supreme Court on Friday denied an emergency appeal from Republicans in Pennsylvania, solidifying a decision to count provisional ballots for voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected.The ruling upholds a Pennsylvania Court decision that election officials must accept these ballots, marking a win for voting-rights advocates who sought this measure, particularly in Republican-controlled counties.Voting rights groups argued that allowing provisional ballots would ensure voters who made minor mistakes with mail-in ballots, such as missing signatures or dates, would not be disenfranchised.According to state data, approximately 9,000 ballots of the over 1.6 million returned had been flagged for such errors as of Thursday.Pennsylvania holds significant weight in this year’s presidential election, with 19 electoral votes , and is expected to be a key player in the tight race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The state’s role was similarly pivotal in 2016 and 2020 when the margin was within tens of thousands of votes.As Friday marked the last day for voters in Pennsylvania to request mail-in ballots, election offices saw high turnout and long lines. In Erie County, a judge ruled that 15,000 voters who applied for a mail ballot but hadn’t received it could visit the elections office through Monday to get a replacement. Meanwhile, Bucks County in suburban Philadelphia saw lines stretching outside its Doylestown elections office as voters scrambled to apply for ballots ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline.Nakesha McGuirk, a Democrat from Bensalem, chose to wait despite the lengthy line, saying, “I did not expect the line to be this long. But I’m going to stick it out.” Concerned about her ability to vote on Election Day due to a long commute, McGuirk, a Harris supporter, decided to cast her vote early to avoid any issues. “I figured that rather than run into the risk of not getting home in time to go and vote, that it would be better to just do it this way early,” she added.Patrick Lonieski, a Republican from Buckingham and a Trump supporter, also opted for the convenience of early voting. “I just want to make sure I get my ballot in and it’s counted,” said Lonieski, 62, who was joined by his son, voting for the first time.As the 5 p.m. deadline approached, voters pushed to make it inside in time, with one last person dashing to the door as bystanders encouraged her. “Let’s go! Hurry up! You can do it!” someone shouted, and the crowd cheered as she made it just before closing.This surge in applications came after a Bucks County judge extended the deadline by three days in response to a Trump campaign lawsuit, which claimed that voters faced undue obstacles due to high demand at application-processing offices. The decision helped alleviate delays and frustration among voters seeking to participate in the election.","The Supreme Court on Friday denied an emergency appeal from Republicans in Pennsylvania, solidifying a decision to count provisional ballots for voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper provided a live correction of Vice President Kamala Harris 's interpretation of former US President Trump's recent statements at a rally.During her Phoenix, Arizona rally, Harris addressed abortion restrictions, saying, ""Now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban , many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump 's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote 'whether the women like it or not.'""She further said, ""We must vote because this is the thing.

He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.""The actual context of Trump's statement related to his stance on protecting women from illegal immigrants. At his rally, Trump said, ""Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all over the world from Venezuela to the Congo, including savage criminals who assault, rape, and murder our women and girls. Anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near the Oval Office."" He added, ""I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not. I'm gonna protect them.""Tapper addressed this discrepancy on ""The Lead,"" saying, ""When Trump said he was going to do something for women, whether they like it or not, whether the women like it or not, he was talking about protecting women, protecting women whether they like it or not.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district.

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous.""

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border. The attack happened in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. About 20 to 25 militants targeted the Frontier Constabulary post, a police assistance force. The Pakistan Taliban , also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed the attack in a statement to AFP.Since the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has faced a surge in terrorism, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan. Recent anti-terror operations in North Waziristan led to the elimination of about a dozen militants this month. In the most recent operation Pakistani security forces killed nine insurgents, including a high-level target, in a shootout overnight in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the volatile northwestern region that borders Afghanistan, the military said Thursday.According to a Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, violence increased sharply in 2024, with a 90% surge in fatalities in the third quarter alone. The year's total fatalities, now at 722, have already surpassed all of 2023, with 97% occurring in these two provinces, marking the highest rate in a decade.","A suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border.

Minority Hindus gathered in large numbers on Friday to protest in Bangladesh , with approximately 30,000 demonstrating in Chattogram under police and military protection. Similar demonstrations occurred across the country as Hindus sought protection from attacks and demanded the withdrawal of sedition cases against their community leaders, as reported by AP.Hindu groups reported an increase in attacks since early August, following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after a student-led uprising. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , who leads the interim government, says the reported figures are exaggerated.Hindus, who constitute about 8% of Bangladesh’s population of nearly 170 million, claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4. They believe the interim government is not offering adequate protection, and they fear the growing influence of hardline Islamists.Activists continue advocating for minority protection laws, a dedicated ministry, and other demands including extended holiday periods for religious festivals.The Chattogram protest was organised quickly after sedition charges were filed against 19 Hindu leaders on Wednesday, including priest Chandan Kumar Dhar. This was related to an October 25 rally in which a group allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag, considered disrespectful. Two leaders were arrested, causing anger in the Hindu community.Leaders claim these charges are politically motivated and are demanding their withdrawal within 72 hours. Another rally is scheduled for Saturday in Dhaka.Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and ally Jatiya Party also report being targeted since Hasina's removal. The Jatiya Party headquarters was vandalized and set on fire on Thursday. Jatiya Chairman G M Quader stated, “We will continue to hold rallies and demand our rights. We are not afraid to risk our lives.” The party plans a rally in Dhaka on Saturday to protest rising commodity prices and what they describe as false charges against their leaders.","Hindus claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4.

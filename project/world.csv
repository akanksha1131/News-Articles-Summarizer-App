'Framework'





BRUSSELS: The EU and Britain look will haggle to the wire over fishing rights and food checks as they seek a deal on closer defence ties at a landmark post-Brexit summit next week.The meeting in London on Monday between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the EU's top officials was planned to bring the first results from London's much-vaunted ""reset"" in ties.Inking a defence and security partnership is seen as a symbolic step in turning the tide after the years of bad blood since Britain's exit from the bloc on January 31, 2020.But old habits die hard and the two sides are squabbling to the last over long-standing bugbears that threaten to stall the rapprochement.Diplomats in Brussels said negotiations were focused on getting Britain to keep its waters open for European fishermen, in return for the EU easing checks on some food imports from the UK.Other sticking points include an EU push for a scheme allowing young people to move more easily between the two sides that London fears threatens its red line on returning to free movement.""They want everything and they're giving nothing,"" one European diplomat complained of the British stance, speaking like others on condition of anonymity.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Starmer could look to give the talks a final shove over the finishing line at a summit of European leaders in Albania on Friday.If they can overcome the last hurdles, then the ""security and defence partnership"" to be signed would be the highlight of the London sit-down.The move is aimed at opening the door to closer cooperation as both the EU and Britain race to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.That should mean more regular security talks, Britain considering joining EU military missions and the potential for London to fully tap into a 150-billion-euro ($167-billion) defence fund being set up by the bloc.But the deal is expected to leave much of the detail to be filled in later -- for instance requiring a further agreement on giving the UK and its defence industry unfettered access to the EU programmes.""It's a framework for more cooperation,"" another EU diplomat said.Reaching the security pact was long seen as the lowest hanging fruit for negotiators given that Britain already has intertwined defence ties with 23 EU countries in NATO.Those bonds have only tightened as Trump has rattled Europe by pushing for a quick end to the war in Ukraine.Britain has teamed up with France to spearhead plans for possibly deploying troops to Ukraine in the event of any deal.A UK government official speaking on condition of anonymity said the defence pact is expected to be agreed.Another British official familiar with the matter stressed that Monday was just the first in a series of annual summits.""Inevitably there are things that are agreed for this summit, there will be things we agree to carry on discussing, and things we don't get over the line at all,"" they said.The defence partnership was envisioned to be inked alongside two other documents.One sets out a shared vision on global issues and another lists the thorny subjects both sides hope to make progress on in the coming months.London and Brussels are treading carefully as closer cooperation with the EU remains a politically divisive issue for Starmer who faces a growing challenge from diehard anti-EU Reform UK.","EU and Britain look will haggle to the wire over fishing rights and food checks.

Family of Black man fatally shot by Washington sheriff's deputy settles lawsuit for $3.5 million,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-of-black-man-fatally-shot-by-washington-sheriffs-deputy-settles-lawsuit-for-3-5-million/articleshow/121200502.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)





Family members of a Black motorist fatally shot by a deputy in southwestern Washington state during a traffic stop have settled their wrongful death lawsuit for $3.5 million.The Clark County Council agreed Wednesday to make the payment in the 2021 death of 30-year-old Jenoah Donald , The Columbian reported.Donald lived in the city of Battle Ground, Washington, and died Feb 12, eight days after he was shot in the head by Sean Boyle, a deputy with the Clark Sounty Sheriff's Office.The family filed the federal lawsuit in 2022 in US District Court in Tacoma alleging wrongful death, assault and battery, negligence and deprivation of civil rights. Trial was set to start June 9.Attorneys for the Donald family said in a statement that the settlement provides accountability and closure.""This outcome honors Jenoah Donald's life and underscores a simple truth: When officers ignore their training and resort to needless lethal force, they will be held accountable,"" attorney Angus Lee said in the statement.The county ""continues to deny liability for this unfortunate incident,"" county spokeswoman Joni McAnally told the newspaper.Prosecuting attorneys from outside Clark County examined the shooting and found it was justified in protecting the deputies.Deputies that night responded to a call about two cars suspiciously driving around a neighborhood and pulled over Donald's car for what they described as a faulty rear light.Lawyers for Donald's family argued in the lawsuit that was an unlawful stop, citing a 1999 Washington Supreme Court case that found it is unconstitutional for police to use a traffic stop as an excuse to investigate suspected criminal activity.The family's attorneys said Donald was cooperative initially. The situation escalated after another deputy, Holly Troupe, said she saw a sharp object inside Donald's vehicle, which investigators later said was a screwdriver.A struggle ensued as Boyle and Troupe tried to pull Donald out of the car, an outside investigation showed. Boyle fired twice when Donald ignored commands to let him go as the car lurched forward with the deputy partially inside, according to investigators. One bullet hit and killed Donald.Donald was on the autism spectrum and prone to withdrawal in stressful situations, his lawyers have said.Donald was the second Black man killed by deputies in four months. On Oct 29, a law enforcement task force attempted a drug sting involving 21-year-old Kevin Peterson Jr that ended with three deputies firing at Peterson as he ran away while carrying a gun.Peterson's family, represented by the same attorneys, sued the county in 2022. The county later agreed to pay his family $1.25 million to settle the lawsuit. That shooting also was deemed justified by prosecutors.","The Clark County Council agreed Wednesday to make the payment in the 2021 death of 30-year-old Jenoah Donald.

Priya Saxena: Federal court protects Indian student Priya Saxena in US from deportation over minor traffic violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/federal-court-protects-indian-student-priya-saxena-in-us-from-deportation-over-minor-traffic-violation/articleshow/121199424.cms,"Federal court protects Indian student Priya Saxena in US from deportation over minor traffic violation (Picture credit: LinkedIn, X)

Indian Student On The US Deportation List Gets Loud Cheers At Graduation

A federal court has granted a preliminary injunction protecting Priya Saxena , a 28-year-old Indian student who recently completed her PhD in South Dakota , from deportation following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) attempt to revoke her visa.Saxena, who earned her doctorate in chemical and biological engineering from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, had her F-1 visa (valid until 2027) unexpectedly revoked in April. She received notification via email from the US embassy in New Delhi, and her Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record was terminated, threatening her ability to receive her PhD.The government's decision stemmed from a minor 2021 traffic violation - failure to yield to an emergency vehicle. Her attorney, Jim Leach, noted that Saxena had previously disclosed this incident during her visa application process, and immigration officers had approved her entry after reviewing the details. While she was initially suspected of a DUI in 2021, charges were dropped after a blood test, and these facts were known when her visa was reissued.""The government reissued her visa and then comes back three and a half years later and says, 'Oh, wait a minute. Get out of the country now,'"" Leach told NBC News. ""It just makes no sense.""Saxena's legal challenge argued that DHS violated both the Administrative Procedure Act and her Fifth Amendment due process rights by revoking her SEVIS status without warning or opportunity to respond. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order allowing her to graduate, and on Thursday extended that protection through a preliminary injunction, enabling her to remain in the US and apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT).The case has broader implications, as DHS revealed it had reviewed records of 1.3 million foreign-born students, identifying thousands for visa revocation . Leach noted that Saxena's case is one of ""dozens and dozens"" where students have successfully challenged similar DHS decisions.The timing of the case coincided with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem receiving an honorary doctorate at Dakota State University, creating a stark contrast that Leach described as ""something out of a really far-out novel."" While Saxena was celebrated by her classmates, Noem faced protests over her immigration policies.Despite the government's argument that no harm was done due to the reinstatement of Saxena's status, the judge granted the injunction to prevent potential future revocation, acknowledging the unlawful nature of DHS's actions and the need for protection of students' rights.","Priya Saxena, a 28-year-old Indian student, recently completed her PhD in South Dakota.

US Supreme Court considers ending birthright citizenship: What it could mean for immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-considers-ending-birthright-citizenship-what-it-could-mean-for-immigrants/articleshow/121200099.cms,"A challenge to a century-old precedent





The US Supreme Court is deliberating a case that could fundamentally alter the definition of American citizenship, as it weighs President Donald Trump’s executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants and those in the US on temporary visas. The implications are vast: more than 150,000 newborns could be denied citizenship annually if the order is upheld, according to the plaintiffs challenging the directive, which includes Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and immigrant rights advocates.At issue is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment , which states that all “persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” are US citizens. Trump's administration argues this language does not extend to the children of immigrants whose presence is either unlawful or temporary, such as students or visa workers. This interpretation represents a stark departure from more than a century of legal precedent.In oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer defended the order by claiming the 14th Amendment was only intended to grant citizenship to the children of formerly enslaved people.When pressed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh on how the government would determine the citizenship of newborns under this policy, Sauer admitted, “We just don’t know.”Justice Elena Kagan voiced concern over the lack of clarity and questioned why the administration was challenging a precedent so firmly rooted in history. “If one thinks that it's quite clear that the order is illegal, how does one get to that result in what time frame... without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?” she asked. Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared sceptical of Sauer’s assurance that the issue could work its way through the lower courts without disrupting the current system.The precedent in question is the Supreme Court’s 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed citizenship for children born in the US regardless of their parents' immigration status. Wong, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was denied re-entry after a trip abroad. The court ruled in his favour, cementing the principle of jus soli citizenship by birth.There are only a few exceptions to this principle: children of foreign diplomats, enemy occupiers, and those born in unincorporated US territories like American Samoa are not automatically granted citizenship. However, the Trump administration’s order, if upheld, would mark a radical expansion of these exceptions.Critics warn that ending birthright citizenship could create a legal quagmire. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum cautioned the court that such a change would lead to “unprecedented chaos,” creating a patchwork of legal statuses where children born on the same day in different states or even the same hospital might be treated differently. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called the administration’s stance “a catch-me-if-you-can kind of regime,” where families would be forced to sue to assert rights that should be automatic.Protests have erupted outside the court as the case draws national attention. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined demonstrators, reading from the Constitution and defending the long-standing principle of birthright citizenship. “This is about birthright, it’s about citizenship, it’s about due process,” she said.Legal scholars note that overturning Wong Kim Ark would likely require a constitutional amendment, not just an executive order. Yet the Trump administration has hinted at additional measures such as limiting short-term visas for pregnant travellers as another way to discourage births by non-citizens in the US.If the court sides with Trump, it could restrict injunctions to only the named plaintiffs in the case, resulting in newborns across the country facing vastly different legal realities. In such a scenario, birth certificates might no longer suffice as proof of citizenship, creating uncertainty not just for immigrants, but for all Americans.","The US Supreme Court is deliberating a case that could fundamentally alter the definition of American citizenship.

'Can’t even buy parts on eBay': US transport secretary Sean Duffy flags deepening crisis in US air traffic control system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cant-even-buy-parts-on-ebay-us-transport-secretary-sean-duffy-flags-deepening-crisis-in-us-air-traffic-control-system/articleshow/121199379.cms,"File photo: US transportation secretary Sean Duffy (Picture credit: AP)





US transportation secretary Sean Duffy has warned of a “crisis” in America’s air traffic control system, which is grappling with outdated equipment, severe staffing shortages and a series of high-profile failures, including deadly accidents and repeated outages.Speaking before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday, Duffy revealed that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is so reliant on antiquated systems that it has resorted to searching for replacement parts on eBay and even 3D printing some components.“Sometimes, we can’t even buy it on eBay, so we’re trying to use 3D printing,” Duffy said, as per CBS News.The crisis has come under intense scrutiny following a fatal midair collision in January between a commercial jet and an Army helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people, according to WCHSTV.Additionally, equipment outages at the FAA facility responsible for Newark Liberty International Airport, along with similar issues in Denver and Atlanta, have caused severe flight disruptions.According to CBS News, Newark had just three controllers on duty at one point, compared to the target staffing of 14.Duffy insisted that “the system we currently use… is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We’ve let it age, and now we’re seeing the cracks play out in real time.”He urged lawmakers to support the Trump administration’s proposed multi-billion-dollar overhaul of the system, which includes replacing hundreds of radars, new telecommunications infrastructure, and over a dozen new control towers.The Government Accountability Office has already found that 76% of the FAA’s 138 control systems are unsustainable or potentially unsustainable.Despite concerns, Duffy stressed that air travel remains safe thanks to “multiple redundancies.” However, he conceded that delays and system malfunctions, like the 90-second communications blackout in Denver earlier this week, highlight just how fragile the current infrastructure is.Duffy also addressed criticism over recent layoffs, clarifying that while probationary staff were let go as part of broader federal workforce reductions, no air traffic controllers were cut.“We’ve been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,” he said, pushing back against concerns from Democrats like Sen Patty Murray, who criticised reports of mistaken buyout emails sent to FAA staff.To address the shortfall of 3,000 controllers, the department of transportation has implemented measures like expedited medical testing and retention bonuses for experienced personnel.As Rep Rick Larsen told the House during a related hearing, “The safety of the traveling public cannot continue being put at risk... We need action now.” The FAA is currently in talks with airlines to possibly reduce flights out of Newark, which has seen over 140 cancellations on Thursday alone, amid ongoing staffing challenges.",US transportation secretary Sean Duffy has warned of a ‘crisis’ in America’s air traffic control system.

Early vs full benefits

Who can get full benefits in 2025?

Born 1943–1954: FRA is 66

Born 1955: FRA is 66 and 2 months

Born 1956: FRA is 66 and 4 months

Born 1957: FRA is 66 and 6 months

Born 1958: FRA is 66 and 8 months

Born 1959: FRA is 66 and 10 months

Born 1960 or later: FRA is 67

Why the shift matters now

Solvency concerns





For many Americans nearing retirement, there’s a new number to remember, which is 67.Starting in 2025, the full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security officially moves to 67 for those born in 1960, reports the Newsweek.This marks the end of a decades-long phase-in that affects how and when millions can claim their benefits.The change isn’t sudden. It’s the result of amendments made in 1983 to the Social Security Act, aimed at strengthening the programme’s finances and accounting for people living longer. But it’s only now, as more older Americans reach 65, that the change is finally being felt.In practical terms, anyone born in 1960 will turn 65 in 2025, but they won’t be eligible for full retirement benefits until age 67. That’s the latest milestone in a gradual two-year increase from the previous retirement age of 65.Claiming Social Security before reaching the full age is still possible. Benefits can start as early as 62. However, early retirees face a permanent reduction. According to the Social Security Administration, someone entitled to $1,000 a month at age 67 would receive just $700 if they started at 62.On the other hand, waiting beyond the FRA can boost monthly payments. If a person delays until age 70, they could see their benefit rise to $1,240, which is a 24% increase for waiting three extra years.Only those born before 1960 will reach their FRA and become eligible for full benefits in 2025. Others who turn 65 that year will have to wait until they’re 67 in 2027. The exact retirement age depends on birth year:The change comes at a time when nearly 4 million Americans are expected to turn 65 in 2025. This is part of what experts call the “silver tsunami”, a nickname for the large number of older adults now reaching retirement age. As more people retire, the Social Security system faces greater financial pressure to keep up with payments.Michael Ryan, finance expert and founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek, “This isn’t just a bureaucratic adjustment but a response to increasing life expectancies and the financial challenges facing Social Security.”Social Security’s trust fund for retirement benefits is projected to run short by 2033, according to a 2024 report by the Social Security Board of Trustees. If no changes are made, the system could only pay about 77% of scheduled benefits after that date.Lawmakers remain divided. Republicans have supported raising the retirement age further, with the Republican Study Committee proposing in 2024 “modest adjustments to the retirement age for future retirees to account for increases in life expectancy.”Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing for a different solution. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Brendan Boyle reintroduced the Social Security and Medicare Fair Share Act . It would apply payroll taxes to earnings above $400,000, a threshold currently exempt under the $168,600 tax cap.Boyle said in a press release: “This bill would protect Social Security and Medicare for generations by making the wealthiest Americans pay what they owe. While Republicans are pushing a $7 trillion tax giveaway to the ultra-rich, we’re working to protect the benefits that millions of Americans have earned—and we won’t let them be stolen to fund another billionaire windfall.”",The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security officially moves to 67 for those born in 1960.

Canada reduces income tax in first cabinet meeting of Carney government. How will it benefit Indians there?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-reduces-income-tax-in-first-cabinet-meeting-of-carney-government-how-will-it-benefit-indians-there/articleshow/121191528.cms,"Mark Carney government reduced income tax in its first decision after coming to power.

How will the reduction be calculated?







The first cabinet meeting of the Mark Carney government decided to reduce the income tax for 22 million Canadians starting from July 1. This will help some families to save up to $840 a year, according to a calculation given by the government. This would benefit the large Indian population living in Canada, who pay taxes there.“Last month, Canadians called for change to bring down the cost of living and to put money back in their pockets. My government will be delivering that change­­—cutting taxes for the middle class and saving families up to $840 a year,"" PM Mark Carney said.“With today’s middle class tax cut, we are setting the stage for economic growth by helping hard-working Canadians keep more of their paycheques to spend on the priorities that matter most to them,"" finance minister François-Philippe Champagne said.""Every Canadian should be able to afford necessities, feel secure, and get ahead financially—and this tax cut will help them do just that. As Canadians continue to feel the impact of ongoing challenges including trade and tariff uncertainties, they should be able to keep more of what they earn to help build a stronger future and a more resilient Canada,"" the finance minister said.To reflect a one-percentage-point cut in the lowest tax rate coming into effect halfway through the year, the full-year tax rate for 2025 will be 14.5 per cent and the full-year rate for 2026 and future tax years will be 14 per cent.The Canada Revenue Agency will update its source deduction tables for the July to December 2025 period so that pay administrators are able to reduce tax withholdings as of July 1. This means that, effective July 1, individuals with employment income and other income subject to source deductions could have tax withheld at 14 per cent. Otherwise, individuals will realize this tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns in spring 2026.The bulk of tax relief will go to those with incomes in the two lowest tax brackets (i.e., those with taxable income under $114,750 in 2025), including nearly half to those in the first bracket ($57,375 and below in 2025), the government site said.Indians with middle-income jobs will benefit from the tax cut. If an Indian individual is a tax resident of Canada (determined by factors like time spent in Canada, residential ties, etc.), they are subject to Canadian income tax on their worldwide income. The tax cut will directly benefit those earning up to $57,375 in taxable income, reducing their federal tax liability. An Indian family in Canada with two earners, for example, each with taxable income in the lowest bracket, could save up to $420 per person annually (totaling $840 for a two-income household). This applies to many Indian immigrants working in middle-income jobs, such as those in retail, hospitality, or entry-level professional roles.","Mark Carney government reduced income tax in its first decision after coming to power.

On Trump’s Nobel Prize prospects





A Pakistani journalist faced a sharp rebuff from the US state department official after attempting to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance on de-escalation talks between India and Pakistan. During a briefing on Wednesday, the Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff and claimed that India, particularly PM Modi, did not welcome Trump’s supposed ceasefire efforts.""Pakistan welcomed President Trump's efforts for bringing the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and they believe that President Trump could win a Nobel Peace Prize if he were to bring peace between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue. But Prime Minister Modi did not welcome this effort... Does that disappoint this building at all, the attitude of Narendra Modi of not welcoming this peace deal,"" the reporter asked Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson at the US department of state.Sidestepping the pointed query, Pigott emphasised that the US was focused on maintaining the ceasefire. “That is what we are happy to see. That's where our focus remains. And we want to see a ceasefire be maintained, and we want to encourage direct communication.That is our focus here. Our focus is the ceasefire,” he said. Pigott reiterated that both India and Pakistan should maintain direct communication and pursue peace.While Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration facilitated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, India has asserted that it was Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a truce, driven by pressure after Indian strikes.Responding to the reporter’s claim that Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in easing India-Pakistan tensions, Pigott described Trump as a ""peacemaker.""""He's a peacemaker. He values peace. He's also a dealmaker, and he has shown that again and again and again in terms of both pursuing an America First agenda but also pursuing peace and wanting to see peace and conflicts come to an end,"" Pigott said.The journalist also brought up the use of Israeli drones by India during Operation Sindoor and questioned whether that might create complications between Pakistan and Israel, given Trump's Abraham Accords aimed at fostering ties among Jews, Muslims, and Christians.Pigott, however, steered the conversation back to Washington’s stated priorities: maintaining the ceasefire and encouraging direct dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated that the US focus remains on resolving conflicts through peaceful means.","A Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff.

Poll Do you believe Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should be giving medical advice to the public? Yes, he is qualified No, he should not





US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers on Wednesday that Americans “should not be taking medical advice” from him, reports news agency Reuters.Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.Being a long-time critic of vaccines, Kennedy was grilled by both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate HELP Committee during back-to-back hearings. His remarks came amid a measles outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people and led to three deaths, mostly among the unvaccinated.When asked if he would give his children the measles vaccine today, Kennedy replied, “Measles? Probably for measles, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.”The hearings were meant to review US President Donald Trump ’s proposed 2026 health budget. Kennedy was confirmed in February and has already fired 10,000 staff across key agencies, including the FDA and CDC.He has also supported slashing $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $3.6 billion from the CDC, claiming the changes would “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.”“Our reductions have focused on aligning HHS staffing levels to reflect the size of HHS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw around a 15% increase in the number of employees,” Kennedy told the House subcommittee.Democrats slammed the cuts as dangerous. “All while you peddle unfounded and dangerous vaccine skepticism, spread lies and misinformation about people living with autism,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.At the Senate hearing, Kennedy again declined to clearly support the MMR jab. “I’m not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there’s issues,” he said.When asked whether Elon Musk had influenced his decisions, Kennedy denied taking orders but admitted Musk had assisted with fraud detection. “Elon Musk gave us help in trying and figuring out where there was fraud and abuse in the department. But it was up to me to make the decision,” he said.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who helped secure Kennedy’s confirmation, said Americans deserved clarity. “Americans need direct reassurance from the administration, from you, Mr. Secretary, that its reforms will make their lives easier, not harder.”Audience members protested during the hearing, wearing stickers reading “When Bobby lies, children die” and chanting “RFK kills people with AIDS” before being removed by Capitol police.","Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.

Federal court protects Indian student Priya Saxena in US from deportation over minor traffic violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-court-protects-indian-student-priya-saxena-in-us-from-deportation-over-minor-traffic-violation/articleshow/121200729.cms,"Federal court protects Indian student Priya Saxena in US from deportation over minor traffic violation (Picture credit: LinkedIn, X)

Indian Student On The US Deportation List Gets Loud Cheers At Graduation





A federal court has granted a preliminary injunction protecting Priya Saxena , a 28-year-old Indian student who recently completed her PhD in South Dakota , from deportation following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) attempt to revoke her visa.Saxena, who earned her doctorate in chemical and biological engineering from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology , had her F-1 visa (valid until 2027) unexpectedly revoked in April. She received notification via email from the US embassy in New Delhi, and her Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record was terminated, threatening her ability to receive her PhD.The government's decision stemmed from a minor 2021 traffic violation - failure to yield to an emergency vehicle. Her attorney, Jim Leach, noted that Saxena had previously disclosed this incident during her visa application process, and immigration officers had approved her entry after reviewing the details. While she was initially suspected of a DUI in 2021, charges were dropped after a blood test, and these facts were known when her visa was reissued.""The government reissued her visa and then comes back three and a half years later and says, 'Oh, wait a minute.Get out of the country now,'"" Leach told NBC News. ""It just makes no sense.""Saxena's legal challenge argued that DHS violated both the Administrative Procedure Act and her Fifth Amendment due process rights by revoking her SEVIS status without warning or opportunity to respond. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order allowing her to graduate, and on Thursday extended that protection through a preliminary injunction, enabling her to remain in the US and apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT).The case has broader implications, as DHS revealed it had reviewed records of 1.3 million foreign-born students, identifying thousands for visa revocation . Leach noted that Saxena's case is one of ""dozens and dozens"" where students have successfully challenged similar DHS decisions.The timing of the case coincided with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem receiving an honorary doctorate at Dakota State University, creating a stark contrast that Leach described as ""something out of a really far-out novel."" While Saxena was celebrated by her classmates, Noem faced protests over her immigration policies.Despite the government's argument that no harm was done due to the reinstatement of Saxena's status, the judge granted the injunction to prevent potential future revocation, acknowledging the unlawful nature of DHS's actions and the need for protection of students' rights.","Priya Saxena, a 28-year-old Indian student, recently completed her PhD in South Dakota.

(AP)





After US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the US department of state, called the US president a ""peacemaker"" and underlined the importance of peace in the region.Pigott said the United States was pleased with the ongoing ceasefire between the two countries and said that the main objective was to promote direct talks between India and Pakistan.During a press briefing, Pigott said, ""What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. We want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. Taking a step back, the President is a peacemaker, and we celebrate the advancement of peace. We hope the ceasefire will be maintained.""Earlier, on Sunday, US President Trump welcomed the end of hostilities between the two nations. He mentioned that many lives could have been lost if peace had not been achieved, referring to the risk of a nuclear conflict.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am very proud of the strong and unwaveringly powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much.Millions of good and innocent people could have died! Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. ""Trump also said that the US had played a role in helping the two sides reach peace and repeated his willingness to mediate on the Kashmir issue.""I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision. While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations. Additionally, I will work with you both to see if, after a 'thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir. God Bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!!!""India has consistently rejected any outside involvement in the Kashmir issue. India has always opposed third-party involvement in the Kashmir issue. For New Delhi, it is a domestic and bilateral matter, to be addressed—if necessary—only in direct talks with Islamabad. This stance is supported by the 1972 Shimla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration. Any suggestion of external participation, particularly from a major power like the United States, is seen as interfering with India's strategic independence.External affais minister S Jaishankar also said on Thursday that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will be ""strictly bilateral.""""To me things are fairly clear. So, let me take this opportunity to spell out our position. One, where Pakistan is concerned, our relations, our dealings with them will be bilateral, and strictly bilateral.""""That is a national consensus for many years, and there is absolutely no change in that consensus that dealings with Pakistan will be bilateral,"" Jaishankar said.","Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the US department of state, called the US president a ""peacemaker"" Pigott said the United States was pleased with the ongoing ceasefire between the two countries.

Criminal investigation opened in rape and sexual assault allegations against Smokey Robinson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/criminal-investigation-opened-in-rape-and-sexual-assault-allegations-against-smokey-robinson/articleshow/121199506.cms,"Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation following allegations of rape and sexual assault made by four former housekeepers (Image: AP)





The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that it has opened a criminal investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against Motown music luminary Smokey Robinson The department said in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau is ""actively investigating criminal allegations"" against Robinson.Last week, four former housekeepers of Robinson filed a lawsuit alleging that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted them, in some cases for years, while they worked for him.The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024.Robinson's lawyer said there was no merit to the allegations against the 85-year-old musical icon who was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s.The attorney, Christopher Frost, said Tuesday the only reason for the suit is ""unadulterated avarice.""""We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,"" Frost said.John Harris and Herbert Hayden, the lawyers for the women, say they are pleased to learn that law enforcement is pursuing the allegations.""Our clients intend to fully cooperate with LASD's ongoing investigation in the pursuit of seeking justice for themselves and others that may have been similarly assaulted by him,"" the lawyers said.The sheriff's statement said the investigation is in its early stages, and no other details would be provided.Robinson's attorney said last week that the allegations ""defy credulity"" and are full of inconsistencies.The four women, whose names have not been made public, each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them. One woman said she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024 and was assaulted at least 20 times. Another said she worked for him from 2014 until 2020 and was assaulted at least 23 times.Harris called Robinson a ""serial and sick rapist"" who must be stopped.When asked at a May 6 news conference whether the women had talked to police, Hayden said no, but felt the allegations merited law enforcement getting involved.All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status.Robinson churned out a host of hits as a central part of the Motown Records machine - both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including ""Tears of a Clown"" and ""The Tracks of My Tears."" He also wrote and co-wrote songs for other Motown artists, including the Temptations' ""My Girl.""He is a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.","The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that it has opened a criminal investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against Motown music luminary Smokey Robinson.

Trump's Mideast trip splashes out on deals and diplomacy but is unusually quiet on human rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-mideast-trip-splashes-out-on-deals-and-diplomacy-but-is-unusually-quiet-on-human-rights/articleshow/121199479.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Photo: AP)





Washington: Saudi royalty and American billionaires were in the front row for a speech in Riyadh where President Donald Trump condemned what he called past U.S. interference in the wealthy Gulf states. Gone were the days when American officials would fly to the Middle East to give ""you lectures on how to live, and how to govern your own affairs,"" Trump said at a Saudi investment forum this week.No one in the audience sat closer, or listened more intently, than Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Ordinary Arabs listened, too, including Saudi journalists, rights advocates, businesspeople, writers and others who had fled the kingdom. Their fear: Trump's words underlined a message that the United States was pulling back from its longtime role as an imperfect, sporadic but powerful advocate for human rights around the world.""It was painful to see,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, whose 68-year-old father, a Saudi cleric with a wide following, was among hundreds of royals, civil society figures, rights advocates and others jailed by Prince Mohammed in the first years of his rise to de facto ruler.Saudi Arabia has since freed many of those people in what groups say is the crown prince's improved human rights record following past international criticism and isolation. But Abdullah's father, Salman Alaoudh , is among the many still behind bars.Trump was speaking directly to the prince - ""the person who tortured my father, who has banned my family"" from leaving the kingdom, said Abdullah, who advocates for detained and imprisoned people in Saudi Arabia from the United States.The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.A White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said Trump's speech ""celebrated the ever-growing partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia"" and a Middle East working toward peace. Kelly did not respond to a question about whether the president had raised human rights issues with Gulf leaders.A State Department spokesman, Tommy Pigott , called Trump's discussions with Gulf leaders private.Less attention than usual on human rightsTrump's first major trip of his second term - also including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - drew far less attention to human rights than is typical for U.S. visits to autocratic countries with spotty records on free speech, fair trials and other rights.Human rights groups posted concerns about the Gulf countries, but some refrained from more vocal objections. Saudi exiles in the U.S. also skipped the usual pointed comments on social media. And the administration faced few of the typical questions on whether a visiting president had used the trip to press for the release of detained Americans or imprisoned activists.That's partly due to human rights improvements in Saudi Arabia, groups say. But the silence also reflects what some organizations call a worsening human rights picture in the United States.Ibrahim Almadi, a Florida man seeking U.S. help getting his father home from Saudi Arabia, said he tried in vain to score a commitment from a Republican lawmaker or other official to urge Trump to raise his father's cause. His now 75-year-old Saudi American father, Saad Almadi , had been jailed over critical tweets about the Saudi government and now is under an exit ban from the country.""It is a love relationship between Trump and MBS,"" the son said. One mention of the case to Trump, then one comment by Trump to the Saudi crown prince, and ""I will have my father back.""Some voices have gone silentSome Saudis who fled to the U.S. say they are pulling back from social media and any public criticism of Saudi officials, fearing the same detentions and deportations faced by some immigrants and pro-Palestinian protesters under the Trump administration.Democracy in the Arab World Now - the nonprofit founded by Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S.-based journalist killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul - is advising Arabs with unsettled immigration status in the U.S. to ""be cautious when they travel, to be thoughtful about what they say,"" executive director Sarah Leah Whitson said.The U.S. intelligence community said the crown prince oversaw the 2018 plot, while he has denied any involvement. The killing of Khashoggi, who used his Washington Post column to urge Prince Mohammed to institute reforms, led then-President Joe Biden to pledge to make Saudi royals into pariahs.But soaring U.S. gasoline prices in 2022 spurred Biden to visit the oil-exporting giant, where he had an awkward fist bump with the prince.In his second term, Trump has tightened his embrace of Prince Mohammed and other wealthy Gulf leaders, seeking big investments in the U.S., while Trump's elder sons are developing major real estate projects in the region.The human rights record in Saudi ArabiaBurned by the condemnation and initial isolation over Khashoggi, Prince Mohammed has quietly released some of those imprisoned for seeking women's right to drive, for critical tweets, for publicly proposing Saudi policy changes and more. The prince also has liberalized legal and social conditions for women, part of a campaign to attract business and diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.But many others remain in prison. Thousands, including Almadi, face exit bans, rights groups say.Those organizations cite another reason that activists are staying quieter than usual during the trip: the United States' own human rights reputation.Besides deportations, Whitson pointed to U.S. military support to Israel during its 19-month offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians. The Trump administration says it's trying to secure a ceasefire.Americans faulting another country's abuses now ""just doesn't pass the laugh test,"" Whitson said. ""The United States does not have the moral standing, the legal standing, the credibility to be chastising another country at this moment in time.""

Former FBI director Comey under investigation over cryptic ‘8647’ post targeting Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-fbi-director-comey-under-investigation-over-cryptic-8647-post-targeting-trump/articleshow/121199341.cms,"



Former FBI Director James Comey is facing a federal investigation after sharing a controversial photo on Instagram that sparked outrage among Trump allies. The post showed seashells arranged to form the numbers “86 47,” which critics argue was a veiled threat against President Donald Trump, the 47th president of the United States.Comey captioned the image, “Cool shell formation on my beach walk,” but the numbers raised concerns, particularly the use of “86,” which can be slang for “getting rid of” someone. While Merriam-Webster notes the term can mean “to kill” in certain contexts, it has not officially adopted that definition due to its limited use.The post was swiftly deleted after backlash. Comey later clarified that he hadn’t realised the numbers could be interpreted as violent. “I assumed they were a political message,” he wrote, adding, “I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down.”Despite the explanation, the reaction from Trump supporters was fierce. Donald Trump Jr. accused Comey of calling for his father’s assassination, calling the post “demented.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem went further, saying, “Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump.”Current FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the agency is cooperating with the US Secret Service in investigating the matter. “Primary jurisdiction is with the Secret Service, and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support,” Patel said.White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair also weighed in, calling the post a “clarion call to terrorists and hostile regimes” while the president is abroad in the Middle East.Comey, who led the FBI from 2013 until he was fired by Trump in 2017, is currently promoting his new crime novel, *FDR Drive*. His tenure at the FBI remains controversial, particularly over his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton’s emails and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election neither of which led to charges, though both drew sharp criticism from both political sides.","Former FBI Director James Comey is facing a federal investigation after sharing a controversial photo on Instagram.

The Trump administration is moving to expand its crackdown on illegal immigration, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requesting 20,000 National Guard troops to support enforcement operations. A DHS official toldthat the request was made to the Pentagon to help fulfil the President’s pledge to arrest and deport criminal undocumented immigrants. While the Defence Department acknowledged receiving the request, officials said it remains in the early planning stages, with legal reviews ongoing regarding the Guard’s role in interior immigration enforcement.There is uncertainty over whether the National Guard would be used for direct arrests or in a support capacity such as transportation or logistics. It also remains unclear whether President Trump would require state governors to approve the deployment or move to federalise the Guard. The last instance of federalising the National Guard was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.The move has drawn swift backlash from Democrats. Senator Tammy Duckworth criticised the request as an unprecedented misuse of the military within the US, warning it could set a dangerous precedent.She said deploying the Guard for immigration enforcement undermines national readiness and threatens civil liberties, adding that Trump’s approach risks expanding military authority over civilians.National Guard troops have previously been used at the state level, most notably in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott authorised them to arrest migrants. However, this would be the first instance of a national-level deployment focused on deportations.Alongside the National Guard request, the administration has launched new measures to incentivise voluntary departure. Migrants who agree to self-deport using the “CBP Home” app will be offered $1,000 and free travel. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described this as the safest and most cost-effective option, with flights already departing from cities like Chicago.Critics warn that such departures could undermine legal asylum claims and complicate migrants' ability to return legally in the future. Nevertheless, the White House claims dramatic progress, boasting a 95% reduction in illegal border crossings and declaring the current state of the border the most secure in modern US history.",The request was made to the Pentagon to help fulfil the President’s pledge to arrest and deport criminal undocumented immigrants.

Trump is planning a $45M military parade on his birthday





A massive military parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army , coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday on June 14, is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, according to Army officials.As per CBS News, the event is expected to feature more than 100 vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks, Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles, and artillery units like Howitzers. It could also involve up to 50 helicopters, requiring “extensive coordination” with the Federal Aviation Administration.The day will conclude with a fireworks display and live performances.Lt Col Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson, confirmed that around 6,600 to 7,500 soldiers will participate,according to CNBC.Many will arrive days ahead and be housed in federal buildings such as the department of agriculture and a general services administration warehouse in Washington, DC. Soldiers will receive one hot meal, two ready-to-eat meals daily, and $50 in extra pay.The celebration, which includes period uniforms and vintage aircraft flyovers from World War II-era B-17s and P-51 Mustangs, will run from Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall.The Independent reported that the Army is still struggling to source accurate historical uniforms from the War of 1812 and the Spanish-American War.Trump said, “We’re going to have a big, beautiful parade.” He insisted the event is not tied to his birthday and brushed off concerns over the cost: “It would be peanuts compared to the value of doing it.”As per media reports, the US president’s fascination with military parades likely began after he attended France’s Bastille Day celebrations in 2017, when he said, ""we're going to have to try and top it"". Although he had attempted to organize a similar event in 2018, he cancelled it after the cost was projected at $92 million.He later blamed “local politicians who run Washington, DC, poorly” for inflating the price, as per CBS News.The National Park Service has received permit requests for both the parade and a planned counterprotest. According to The Independent, one application calls the parade “an insult to the American people,” and estimates up to 20,000 demonstrators might attend.Democratic critics, including Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, have slammed the plan as wasteful. “The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday,” Cohen said in a statement.Despite opposition, the event is set to be the grand finale of a weeklong commemoration, with concerts, parachute jumps, military demonstrations, and musical performances, including country music stars, reported The Independent.Fireworks are scheduled for 9:45 pm (local time) on the National Mall.","US President Donald Trump will celebrate his 79th birthday on June 14.

Harvard Law paid $27 for a copy of Magna Carta. Surprise! It’s an original,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-law-paid-27-for-a-copy-of-magna-carta-surprise-its-an-original/articleshow/121198440.cms,"NYT photo





Bought for $27.50 after WWII, the faint, water stained manuscript in the library of Harvard Law School had attracted relatively little attention since it arrived there in 1946.That is about to change.Two British academics, one of whom happened on the manuscript by chance, have discovered it is an original 1300 version — not a copy, as long thought — of Magna Carta, the medieval document that helped establish some of the world’s most cherished liberties. It is one of just seven such documents from that date still in existence.“I never in all my life expected to discover a Magna Carta,” said David Carpenter , professor of medieval history at King’s College London. The manuscript’s value is hard to estimate, although it is fair to say its price tag of under $30 (about $500 today) must make it one of the bargains of the last century. A 710-year-old version was sold in 2007 for $21.3 million.Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at University of East Anglia, in eastern England, helped authenticate the text. He said the document, which bound the nation’s rulers to acting within the law, had resurfaced at a time when Harvard has come under extraordinary pressure from Trump govt.“In this particular instance, we are dealing with an institution that is under direct attack from the state itself, so it’s almost providential. ...”Providential or not, the discovery happened largely by chance. Carpenter was plowing his way through Harvard Law School’s digital images when he opened a file named HLS MS 172 — catalogue name for Harvard Law School Manuscript 172. “I get down to 172 and it’s a single parchment sheet of Magna Carta,” he said. “And I think ‘Oh my God, this looks to me for all the world... like an original.” He emailed Vincent, who was at work in a library in Brussels. “David sent it with a message saying, ‘What do you think that is?. .. ’” said Vincent. “I wrote back within seconds, saying, ‘You and I both know what that is!’”They were able to confirm its authenticity after Harvard photographed it under ultraviolet light and subjected it to various levels of spectral imaging, a technique which can enhance aspects of historical documents undetectable to the human eye. Comparing it with six previously known originals, they found the text and dimensions matched. The handwriting also tallied. Magna Carta — “Great Charter” in Latin — has been used to justify many different causes over the centuries, sometimes on shaky historical ground. First issued in 1215, the document put into writing a set of concessions won by rebellious barons from a recalcitrant King John of England.It influenced the US Constitution. Harvard bought its version from a London book dealer, which had purchased it in Dec 1945 from Sotheby’s.","Two British academics, one of whom happened on the manuscript by chance, have discovered it is an original 1300 version.

The demand for H-1B visas remains high, far outstripping the annual quota of 85,000 (which includes Masters’ Cap of 20,000).US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) received 3,43,981 eligible H-1B cap registrations for the 2026 fiscal (ending Sept 30, 2026) of which 7,828 were for beneficiaries with multiple registrations. The registration period was open from March 7 up to March 24. Eligible registrations for the 2025 fiscal were 4,70,342, of which 47,314 were for beneficiaries with multiple registrations.

However, this is not due to lack of appetite for H-1B workers. USCIS says, “We believe the decreased numbers indicate fraud investigations and beneficiary-centric selection process have been effective integrity measures.”The beneficiary-centric registration system was introduced for 2025 fiscal to combat gaming the system where some companies submitted multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary — greater the number of registrations submitted on behalf of an individual, higher the chances of being selected in a lottery. Now, each beneficiary is entered into the H-1B cap lottery selection process once, regardless of how many registrations were submitted on his/her behalf.On the possibility of a second lottery in fiscal 2026, experts said a clearer picture will emerge in July or later, after the visa applications are filed for the selected beneficiaries.If the annual quota falls short, a second lottery is conducted from the existing registration-pool itself.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) received 3,43,981 eligible H-1B cap registrations for the 2026 fiscal.

Suspected relationship with Michael B. Jordan

Kid Cudi's car 'blowing up'

'Freak-offs'





Britney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were unexpectedly drawn into Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ sex-trafficking trial this week, as Cassie Ventura, the rapper’s former longtime girlfriend, continued her gripping testimony in a New York courtroom.Ventura, who dated Combs for more than a decade, was being cross-examined by the defence as she detailed incidents from their turbulent relationship. Her account came amid intense questioning by Combs’ legal team, who were attempting to challenge her version of events.During cross-examination on Thursday, Cassie told the court that Diddy had invited Spears to her 21st birthday party in Las Vegas, the same night he first kissed her. “Sean was there and he brought [music producer] Dallas Austin, Britney Spears,” she said, according to the New York Post. “I think those were the two people that stand out to me.”At the time, their relationship was said to be platonic. However, Cassie testified that Diddy’s sudden kiss during the celebration at Jet Nightclub in The Mirage Hotel left her in tears. “I was just really confused at the time,” she said. “I was a young, new artist who just didn’t really know the lay of the land when it came to things like that.”Photos from the 2007 party also show Paris Hilton in attendance. Rapper 50 Cent hosted another event the same night at the Hard Rock Hotel, where Diddy’s group later arrived. 50 Cent hasn’t commented on the party connection since the court proceedings began.Cassie also revealed that Combs once suspected her of having an affair with actor Michael B. Jordan. Under questioning from Combs’ lawyer, Cassie confirmed that the mogul had confronted her over alleged involvement with Jordan while she was filming in South Africa in 2016.“Mr. Combs suspected you of a relationship with whom?” the lawyer asked. Cassie answered, “Michael B. Jordan.”Just a day before these revelations, Cassie had dropped another bombshell: Diddy allegedly made threats against rapper Kid Cudi and later, Cudi’s car exploded in his driveway. “He mentioned when we were out of the country that Scott’s car would be blown up and he wanted his friends to see it,” she said in court.When they later bumped into Cudi at SoHo House in New York, Cassie said the rapper asked Combs about the threat. Combs responded casually, “What vehicle?” and moved on.Cassie described how Combs went through her phone during one of the so-called freak-offs and found out about her contact with Cudi. She said Combs became jealous, lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back as she left his home. The court was shown photos of her bruises, taken by her mother.Cassie, who is now eight months pregnant with her third child, has accused Combs of years of abuse during their 11-year relationship. She has testified that she was coerced into sex parties involving male sex workers, which Combs referred to as “freak-offs.” She also accused him of raping her in 2018.Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transporting women for prostitution. If convicted, he could face a life sentence.","Britney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were unexpectedly drawn into Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ sex-trafficking trial this week.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

NEW DELHI: India’s decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.The casualties occurred during India’s major counterterrorism strike in a strong retaliatory action of Pahalgam terroar attack codenamed, Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7. As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes. Among the Pakistan air force casualties were Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.Pakistan army fatalities included Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar, and Sepoy Nisar.","India's decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

""The BLA is neither a pawn nor a silent spectator; we are a dynamic and decisive party,"" the party's spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said.The BLA called on India and international community to recognise Pakistan as a terrorist state and take decisive action against it, warning that failure to do so would lead to further bloodshed and instability.

Chinese military on Monday addressed the reports claiming that it sent its largest military cargo plane with arms supplies to Pakistan during its offensive against India last week. The People's Liberation Army Air Force called it a ""rumour"" and warned of legal action against those behind this.In a statement published on the official website of the Chinese defence ministry, the Air Force clarified that no such mission had taken place, countering the speculation circulating across various internet platforms about China's ""Y-20 transporting relief supplies to Pakistan"".""The internet is not beyond the law! Those who produce and spread military-related rumours will be held legally responsible!"" the report added.This came after Beijing rejected claims by Pakistan that it used Chinese fighter jets against India during Operation Sindoor .

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements.

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/funerals-held-in-myanmar-for-pupils-and-teachers-killed-in-airstrike-on-school/articleshow/121163870.cms,"Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school (Photo: AP)





Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The image of the once-powerful President leaving in a humble lungi has gone viral, captured by a security camera and now emblematic of the fall of the Awami League.Hamid, who served two terms as President, is reportedly facing a murder charge. But unlike many top Awami League leaders who were arrested at airports or while crossing borders, he appears to have been allowed to leave the country unimpeded.“According to Articles 34 and 102 of the Constitution, no Bangladeshi citizen can be prevented from travelling unless there is a specific ban from the court. We have not received any instructions to ban him. There was no request or application from the police to detain or arrest him in any case,” an airport official told Dhaka Post.Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India following the August 5 uprising, several senior Awami League figures have either been jailed or disappeared.

Poll Do you support the interim government's decision to ban Awami League activities? Yes, it is necessary for political stability. No, it undermines democracy.





DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt took the unprecedented step of issuing a gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League - the country's oldest political party - and its affiliated outfits, in a move critics say reflects a deepening political crisis following the ouster of longtime PM Sheikh Hasina. The ban, enforced under a hastily amended Anti-Terrorism Act, marks a dramatic escalation in the Muhuammad Yunus-led govt's efforts to reshape the post-Hasina political landscape.The home ministry invoked Section 18 of the new Act to impose the ban, citing ""reasonable grounds"" that the party and its affiliates were involved in terrorism.The revised law permits govt to declare any 'entity' - not just individuals - as terrorist if sufficient grounds exist. According to the gazette, the ban will remain in effect until International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh completes the trials of Awami League members and activists accused of crimes against humanity during last year's anti-govt protests, which led to the ousting of Hasina on Aug 5, ending her 16-year rule.On Saturday, the interim govt announced the prohibition of all Awami League activities, including online engagement, press statements, and public gatherings.The following night, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promulgated an ordinance reinforcing the law by banning all forms of publicity or expression of support for individuals or entities charged under Section 18(1). Awami League has rejected govt's decision and vowed to continue its political activities ""in an appropriate manner"".The ban will be there until ICT completes the trial of the party and its leaders.Meanwhile, Gono Odhikar Parishad, a political party, has urged Election Commission to cancel the registration of Awami League and other members of the 14-party alliance, including Jatiya Party. However, the CEC, AMM Nasir Uddin, said, ""Let the official notification come first. We are waiting for the gazette.""",Ban marks escalation in govt bid to reshape post-Hasina political landscape.

The New Labour Doctrine: Technocratic Populism

Risks and Pushback

Final Word: A New Track, But the Same Band







For the better part of a decade, the UK’s Labour Party had perfected the art of losing.Despite Brexit chaos, five Tory prime ministers, Boris Johnson’s Downing Street circus, Liz Truss ’s lettuce-inflicted collapse, a pandemic, and a brutal cost-of-living crisis, Labour remained stuck in opposition—haunted by its own ideological baggage and public mistrust. Voters flirted with them, but never committed. In fact, by the time the adult in the room (read: Rishi Sunak) took the helm, the British voters were fed up with the torrid Tories.Under Keir Starmer , Labour stormed back into power with 412 seats, ending 14 years of Conservative rule and delivering the party its most decisive mandate since Tony Blair. Starmer entered Downing Street promising “national renewal.”And ten months later, that renewal has a soundtrack.Once content to hum along to the liberal chorus of inclusivity and open borders, Labour under Starmer has flipped the record. If the party’s earlier stance on immigration echoed the hopeful tones of Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song—a rallying cry for arrival and adventure—Starmer has turned down the volume and remixed the track. The tone is no longer about crossing oceans. It’s about drawing lines.Nowhere is that clearer than in immigration, the policy area undergoing perhaps the most dramatic transformation of Starmer’s premiership.Gone is Labour’s open-armed approach. In its place: a tougher, technocratic, and unapologetically control-oriented stance that has redrawn the political centre ground. Starmer’s pivot on immigration isn’t just a shift—it’s a strategic reset of Labour’s governing DNA.In a blistering departure from the past, Starmer’s government has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system—signalling a new era of pragmatism over idealism.His administration’s white paper, released in May 2025, laid out the most comprehensive set of immigration reforms in over a decade. Key features include:The closure of the overseas care worker visa route, despite warnings from the social care sector about staffing shortages. Graduate route visas shortened from two years to 18 months, signalling a clampdown on education-to-immigration pipelines. Employer penalties for sponsors who fail to ensure their visa holders comply with immigration rules.Each policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers—without the theatrics often associated with right-wing immigration crackdowns. Starmer, once a cautious voice on the issue, is now crystal clear: control is back at the heart of UK immigration policy.Unlike his predecessors, Starmer isn’t relying solely on domestic tightening. He’s aggressively pursuing bilateral returns agreements—most prominently with Albania, a key transit point for irregular migration to the UK. This isn’t abstract diplomacy. The results are being posted—literally. Starmer’s own social media feed touts numbers:Labour governments of the past tiptoed around such figures. Starmer leads with them.The message is unmistakable: Labour is no longer the party of soft borders. It is the party of competent enforcement.Perhaps the most symbolic reform in the white paper is the expansion of English language requirements.Skilled migrants are now expected to speak fluent English. Adult dependents—often excluded from integration policy—are now required to meet basic linguistic benchmarks.Starmer has framed this not as exclusion, but as national cohesion.It’s a politically deft move. By focusing on language, Labour communicates a clear, values-based vision of integration—one that appeals across class and party lines.Labour’s pivot isn’t occurring in a vacuum. The political right, now fragmented between the remnants of the Conservatives and Farage-linked Reform UK, continues to press immigration as a defining issue. Nigel Farage , never one to miss a populist wave, has tried to frame Labour’s pivot as a political theft—but in truth, Starmer has simply executed what Farage only ever ranted about.Rather than ceding that ground, Starmer has planted a flag in it. His rhetoric—“take back control,” “deterrence at source,” “secure our borders”—could comfortably fit into a Conservative press release. But under Starmer, those slogans come with spreadsheets and statecraft, not slogans and scapegoats.What makes Starmer’s pivot effective isn’t just the toughness—it’s the tone. Where Boris Johnson offered theatre and Suella Braverman brought ideological warfare, Starmer offers cold clarity. He isn’t trying to rile the base. He’s trying to reassure the majority. That line—“further and faster”—has become the defining rhythm of Starmer’s government. It’s not a slogan. It’s a mission tempo.None of this is without friction.Trade unions and care sector leaders have criticised the loss of overseas recruitment channels. Universities fear a chilling effect on foreign student enrolments. Civil liberties groups have warned of the long-term consequences of hardening language tests and residency pathways.But crucially, there has been no internal revolt. Labour MPs may grumble in private, but few dare publicly challenge the Prime Minister’s line. Starmer holds the whip hand—and the voter trust.A party once paralysed by factionalism is now united under one doctrine: delivery over debate.Keir Starmer hasn’t just shifted Labour’s tone on immigration. He’s composed a new track entirely—tighter, sharper, less forgiving, more focused.If the party once played to the rhythm of globalism and open-door optimism, Starmer now conducts with statecraft and structure. The Immigrant Song may still be on the national playlist—but this version plays in a different key.This isn’t a betrayal of Labour’s soul. It’s an adaptation of its sound. A band playing to a different crowd—without skipping a beat.That’s not just a promise. It’s a tempo.And Keir Starmer is keeping time.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system. New policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers.

Rough November for Elon Musk's Tesla: US sales sink to nearly 4-year low; cheaper EV versions fail to spark demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rough-november-for-elon-musks-tesla-us-sales-sink-to-nearly-4-year-low-cheaper-ev-versions-fail-to-spark-demand/articleshow/125925496.cms,"‘Standard’ models fail to attract buyers



Dealing with backlash



Tesla’s latest attempt to revive demand in the United States faltered in November, with the company posting its weakest monthly sales in nearly four years, despite rolling out cheaper versions of its most popular electric vehicles. Exclusive figures shared with Cox Automotive, cited by Reuters show that US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier and the lowest level since January 2022.The decline comes at a critical time for Tesla, which relies on its new budget “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3 to attract customers. Introduced in October, priced roughly $5,000 below the earlier base models, the lower-cost options were expected to soften the blow of the Trump administration’s decision to scrap the $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.At the same time, the company is also focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots, projects that have helped sustain its $1.4 trillion market value.The cheaper models have, however, not delivered the anticipated boost. According to Cox, which tracks industry-wide sales, November’s total fell nearly 23% year-on-year. Analysts say the drop suggests the new variants have not attracted enough incremental buyers.“The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights.“What’s also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.”Most electric carmakers saw an even steeper impact from the end of federal credits, with overall US EV sales sliding more than 41% in November. A notable detail is that Tesla, despite its own slump, was able to grow its market share to 56.7% from 43.1% a year earlier.Tesla’s slowdown extends a broader trend: deliveries fell last year for the first time after a run of rapid growth, pressured by high interest rates, subdued consumer sentiment and increasing competition, particularly from cheaper models in China and Europe. Analysts expect another fall this year, with Tesla’s lineup largely limited to older models and minor updates. Its most recent new product, the Cybertruck, has struggled to find a sizeable customer base.“Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,” Streaty said. “So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.”The company has also been dealing with reputational setbacks linked to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, including his work for US President Donald Trump and far-right statements that have triggered protests and affected its image.To entice buyers, Tesla has begun offering 0% financing on the Standard Model Y, according to its US website. Both the Standard Model Y and Standard Model 3 were also listed in inventory with reduced prices. Analysts say the move underscores the pressure to stimulate demand.“I think the bottom line is, if the demand was there they wouldn't be offering 0% financing,” Shawn Campbell, an adviser at Camelthorn Investments told Reuters.“The solution for the demand issue ultimately needs to be new, fresh models.”","US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier.

Gas explosion hits San Francisco: Footage shows fireball-like eruption – video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gas-explosion-hits-san-francisco-footage-shows-fireball-like-eruption-video/articleshow/125923764.cms,"



A gas explosion triggered a major fire in the unincorporated community of Ashland near Hayward on Thursday after an underground line was damaged by a construction crew, fire officials said. At least one home was destroyed, windows were blown out and nearby houses shook.Six people were taken to hospital for treatment, Alameda County Deputy Fire Chief Ryan Nishimoto said. Three were sent immediately with serious injuries and three others had more minor injuries, AP news agency reported.Three structures on two separate lots were severely damaged, Nishimoto said. Some of the 75 firefighters on the scene were forced to back off momentarily after feeling electric shocks from fallen power lines.The video, which came from doorbell camera footage, showed a large building engulfed in flames and debris scattered across the area.“We were sitting in the house and it just ... everything shook. Stuff fell off the walls and when we looked at the camera it was like you were watching a war video,” said Brittany Maldonado, who lives across the street and provided the Nest doorbell cam footage to ABC7 News.The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was sending a team to investigate.Pacific Gas & Electric Co was alerted at 7:35 a.m. that a construction crew not affiliated with the utility had damaged an underground gas line. Utility crews arrived to isolate the damaged line but gas was leaking from multiple locations. Workers stopped the flow of gas at 9:25 a.m., and the explosion soon followed.Gas was flowing for two hours but the explosion happened 10 minutes after the line was shut off, PG&E spokesperson Tamar Sarkissian confirmed. She said it took time to isolate the line and stop the flow of gas.The explosion occurred in Ashland, near the city of Hayward in the East Bay, about 15 miles south of Oakland. Hayward is home to about 160,000 residents.Sirens were heard as police arrived and flames spread at the site of the collapsed building. Several workers lifted a large piece of debris near an excavator that was digging in front of the home just before the blast.Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, Julie Watson in San Diego and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","A gas explosion triggered a major fire in the unincorporated community of Ashland near Hayward.

Sperm from donor with cancer-causing gene used to conceive around 200 kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sperm-from-donor-with-cancer-causing-gene-used-to-conceive-around-200-kids/articleshow/125900798.cms,"-





COPENHAGEN: A sperm donor, who is an asymptomatic carrier of a genetic mutation increasing the risk of cancer, was used to conceive at least 197 children worldwide, Denmark’s public broadcaster DR revealed Wednesday. Between 2006 and 2022, the sperm of anonymous Danish man (using the alias Kjeld) was sold to 67 clinics in 14 countries. In Denmark alone, 99 children were fathered by the donor.According to DR, Denmark’s European Sperm Bank (ESB), one of the largest in the world, was alerted in April 2020 that a child conceived via donation and diagnosed with cancer carried a genetic mutation. ESB then tested a sample of the donor’s sperm, but the screening did not detect the rare TP53 mutation. Sales of the sperm, which had been suspended during the testing period, then resumed. Getty ImagesThree years later, ESB was informed of at least one other child conceived from a donation with the mutation that had developed cancer. It then tested several samples, which showed that the donor carried the gene, though he was healthy. The use of his sperm was blocked in 2023. “The specific mutation is a rare and previously non-described TP53 mutation that is only found in a small part of the donor’s sperm cells and not in the rest of the body,” the ESB said.","Sperm of anonymous Danish man sold to 67 clinics in 14 countries.

Zelensky’s ‘Difficult Call’ With US Envoys As Territory Talks Hit Wall | 3-day Miami Talks Conclude

Who is Eileen Higgins ?









Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday's runoff.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. I know Apple is going to be happy. Nobody talked to me more about it than Tim Cook. He said it's a real problem. And it's not going to be a problem anymore... The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card"" Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals.

Christmas To Decide Ukraine’s Fate? Trump’s New Deadline For Peace Deal Rattles Zelensky & EU Allies

US frustration grows as peace talks stall



Europe steps in as battlefield pressure rises







US President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, cautioning that the war’s current trajectory could push the world towards a catastrophic global confrontation. “Things like this end up in third world wars,” he said, urging an immediate halt to the fighting as he revealed that 25,000 people — “mostly soldiers” — were killed in the past month alone.Speaking at the White House after signing an Executive Order on artificial intelligence regulation, Trump said he was “working very hard” to stop the bloodshed and expressed deep frustration over the lack of progress in US-led negotiations. “I'd like to see the killing stop… I would love to see it stop,” he told reporters.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the President was “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.” She confirmed that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his team were holding discussions with Ukrainian and Russian officials “literally as we speak,” but added that it remained “up in the air” whether the US would send a representative to talks scheduled for this weekend.Trump, who once claimed he could resolve the war “in a day,” has become increasingly vocal about his impatience. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action. He wants this war to come to an end,” Leavitt said.Ukraine has put forward a 20-point plan detailing settlement terms, including separate documents on security guarantees. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv was grateful for Washington’s engagement but warned that territorial questions — such as control of the Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — remain far from resolved. Any concessions, he insisted, would require approval by national referendum.Ukrainian officials say the US has suggested a “free economic zone” in parts of the Donbas, while Russia frames the idea as a “demilitarised zone.” Kyiv is resisting any arrangement that would cement Russian influence. Zelenskyy said compromises under discussion included Ukrainian forces withdrawing from Donetsk on the condition Russian forces do not enter — but stressed that any pullback would require equal withdrawals by Russia.European leaders are scrambling to shape the negotiations amid concerns that Trump’s push for a rapid settlement could leave Ukraine at a disadvantage. Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France’s President Emmanuel Macron have proposed finalising peace proposals with the US over the weekend, warning that the talks are now at “a critical moment.”Russia, meanwhile, is attempting to show it is responsive to Trump’s peace efforts, submitting new “collective security” proposals to Washington. On the battlefield, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russian forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” and had captured the city of Siversk — a claim Ukraine denies.Ukraine also struck back with long-range drones, hitting a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea and forcing Moscow’s airports to halt flights for several hours.",US President Donald Trump delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

SAN FRANCISCO : The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son’s “paranoid delusions” and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in Aug at their home.The lawsuit filed by Adams’ estate Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI “designed and distributed a defective product that validated a user’s paranoid delusions about his own mother.” It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.“Throughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life — except ChatGPT itself,” the lawsuit says. “It fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him.It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his adversary circle.’”OpenAI did not address the allegations in its statement. “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,” the statement said.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft are being sued for wrongful death.

The United States on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting three nephews of President Nicolas Maduro’s wife, along with six crude oil tankers and associated shipping companies.The action coincided with a large-scale US military buildup in the southern Caribbean and President Donald Trump’s campaign for Maduro’s ouster. On Wednesday Trump said the US had seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, Reuters reported.The US Treasury Department said in a statement it imposed sanctions on six shipping companies moving Venezuelan oil, and on six crude oil tankers that it said “have engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime.”Four of the tankers, including the 2002-built H. Constance and the 2003-built Lattafa, are Panama-flagged, with the other two flagged by the Cook Islands and Hong Kong. The targeted vessels are supertankers that recently loaded crude in Venezuela, according to internal shipping documents of state oil company PDVSA.Franqui Flores and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, were also sanctioned.The two were detained in Haiti in 2015 in a US Drug Enforcement Administration operation, convicted in 2016 of attempting a multimillion-dollar cocaine deal and sentenced to 18 years in prison, but released in a 2022 prison swap with Venezuela. A third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores, sanctioned for his alleged role in a corruption plot at PDVSA, was also designated.Wednesday’s seizure of a Venezuelan oil cargo was the first under US sanctions in force since 2019 and the first known tanker action by the Trump administration since the military buildup. The administration plans further tanker seizures, according to sources.US Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that the FBI, Homeland Security and Coast Guard, backed by the US military, carried out a warrant authorising the seizure of a crude tanker transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. The move sent oil prices higher and sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Caracas.President Maduro on Thursday slammed the US seizure of an oil tanker from his country, calling it an act of ""naval piracy"" that escalated tensions between Washington and Caracas.""They kidnapped the crew, stole the ship and have inaugurated a new era, the era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean,"" Maduro said at a presidential event, adding ""Venezuela will secure all ships to guarantee the free trade of its oil around the world.""Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of military intervention in Venezuela, accusing it of sending narcotics to the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security has signed a contract worth nearly $140 million to purchase six Boeing 737 aircraft for deportation operations, as reported by The Washington Post. The move marks a major shift in how the US government carries out removals, giving ICE the ability to operate its own dedicated fleet instead of relying solely on chartered flights.The aircraft are being paid for through a major enforcement funding surge backed by Congress as part of President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda. Lawmakers authorised $170 billion over four years, giving DHS wide latitude to expand detention capacity and transportation systems tied to removals.Officials familiar with the plan say the new planes will allow ICE to increase flight schedules as the administration pushes toward its stated target of 1 million deportations in Trump’s first year. DHS figures show nearly 66,000 people currently in detention and more than 579,000 removals so far.DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the dedicated fleet is expected to reduce operational costs and improve flight efficiency, although she did not detail how those savings would be achieved.The procurement was awarded to Daedalus Aviation, a relatively new firm formed in 2024. Corporate documents list William Allen Walters III as president and Taundria Cappel as chief financial officer. The company promotes itself as offering customised commercial and charter aviation services.Walters and Cappel also oversee Salus Worldwide Solutions, a separate company that previously secured a nearly $1 billion DHS contract linked to voluntary “self-deportation.” That agreement is currently being challenged in court over allegations that the contract process was rushed and improperly structured. Walters declined to comment on the new aircraft deal.Former ICE acting director John Sandweg questioned the logic of purchasing planes outright, noting that charter services have traditionally been more flexible and cheaper than maintaining a full government-operated fleet. Earlier administrations considered the idea but ultimately backed away due to concerns over cost and logistics.ICE Air Operations already handles most US immigration flights, including transfers within the country and deportations abroad. From January through October, it conducted more than 1,700 flights to 77 destinations, according to monitoring data from Human Rights First.With the addition of its own Boeing 737s, DHS is positioned to scale those operations even further, cementing a long-term shift toward a more permanent and expansive deportation infrastructure.","The Department of Homeland Security has signed a contract worth nearly $140 million to purchase six Boeing 737 aircraft for deportation operations.

Wrongful deportation to El Salvador’s mega-prison



Government backlash and shifting deportation plans

Court cites the extraordinary history of the case





A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from US immigration detention after finding he was held without lawful authority. Judge Paula Xinis said his custody had no legal basis because he has no valid removal order and the government has no workable plan to deport him.In her 31-page order, US District Judge Paula Xinis said that since Abrego Garcia’s “wrongful detention in El Salvador,” the government has “re-detained, again without lawful authority,” a man who lacks any valid removal order. She ruled that immigration law does not permit indefinite or punitive detention and that officials cannot hold him when no foreseeable removal is possible.The judge directed the government to notify Abrego Garcia of the time and location of his release and to inform the court once he has been freed from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania.Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old from El Salvador, has lived in Maryland with his wife and child. He was granted withholding of removal in 2019 after a judge found he would face persecution if returned to El Salvador.Despite that order, ICE deported him in March 2025 to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison after Trump officials alleged MS-13 ties, which he denies. The government later called the deportation an “administrative mistake.”He was brought back to the US in June 2025 to face human-smuggling charges in Tennessee, to which he has pleaded not guilty. After being released to his brother’s custody, ICE detained him again even though no lawful removal order existed.The Department of Homeland Security condemned the ruling as “naked judicial activism” and said it would appeal. Officials have attempted to remove him to Liberia and at various points notified him of planned expulsions to Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana. Judge Xinis said none of these options were realistic.She also noted that Costa Rica, his preferred country of removal, had repeatedly stated it would accept him and offer refugee protection. The court found that government efforts to exclude Costa Rica “backfired” when the country publicly reaffirmed its willingness.Xinis called the history of the case “extraordinary,” pointing to wrongful deportation, re-detention and inconsistent plans for removal. She stressed that immigration detention cannot serve as punishment and must be tied to a lawful, achievable removal process.Abrego Garcia will now return to supervision under the US Pretrial Services Office and will follow the release conditions in his Tennessee criminal case.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old from El Salvador, has lived in Maryland with his wife and child.

US pollster wants to 'de-Indianise' tech companies after H-1B rant: 'Never in my life wanted anything more',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pollster-wants-to-de-indianise-tech-companies-after-h-1b-rant-never-in-my-life-wanted-anything-more/articleshow/125919184.cms,"What is ' de-Indianise '?





A political commentator and top US pollster, Mark Mitchel, stirred a row after saying he wants to launch a consultancy to help major American companies “de-Indianise,” raising questions about what the term actually means.Mitchell of Rasmussen Reports frequently appears on Steve Bannon’s (former Trump loyalist) War Room. The anti-immigrant preacher criticised the presence of Indian professionals in the US tech sector. “I have never in my life wanted anything more than this: to build a new corporate consultancy helping major firms de-Indianize,” he said in a post on X.Mitchell’s comments came after a discussion on immigration and the H-1B visa programme, which allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. He argued that Silicon Valley relies too heavily on engineers from countries such as India and China, claiming they are used as cheaper replacements for American workers. “We are talking 60,000, 70,000 dollars a year for roles that pay American engineers 150,000 or more,” he said, adding that American employees are often forced to “train their replacement before getting the boot,"" and how Indians can 'easily' replace American workers.In a post on X, Mitchell said: ""Americans think big tech is out of control. And also, big tech is Indian.""According to a 2025 industry index, around 66 per cent of Silicon Valley’s tech workforce is foreign-born. Of that, 23 per cent are Indian nationals and 18 per cent are Chinese. Yet H-1B holders account for only 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of America’s overall workforce of 163 million.Mitchell argued that the presence of Indian and other foreign engineers creates what he called a “bottomless well” of cheap labour that he believes makes life harder for American families. He even compared a single H-1B developer earning 90,000 dollars to importing ten undocumented labourers earning 9 dollars an hour, saying businesses see both as cost-cutting opportunities.Mitchell used the term “de-Indianise” and raised eyebrows, as the phrase is not commonly used in policy discussions. The dictionary definition of Indianise means to bring something under the cultural or political influence of India or to make it resemble Indian customs. By extension, de-Indianise would mean reversing that process.Broadly, the term is used to imply removing Indian cultural or professional influence. This may include discouraging Indian practices, reducing the presence of Indian professionals, or distancing institutions from Indian identity. In political debates, the term can carry a negative tone, suggesting that something has become too influenced by Indian culture or by people of Indian origin and needs some kind of reform.","Top US pollster, Mark Mitchel, stirred a row after saying he wants to launch a consultancy to help major American companies “de-Indianise,” raising questions about what the term actually means.

Multiple US states to send tax relief payments: Check list and amount,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/multiple-us-states-to-send-tax-relief-payments-check-list-and-amount/articleshow/125920111.cms,"



Which US states are sending payments?

Alaska: $1,000 permanent fund dividend

Alaska’s permanent fund dividend is funded by state oil revenues and provides $1,000 per eligible resident for 2025.

Most payments were issued earlier in the year.

Late or pending applications confirmed by 10 December 2025 will be paid on 18 December 2025.

Applications cleared after that date will be processed in January 2026.

New York: $150 to $400 inflation relief rebate

New York has launched a one-time inflation relief rebate as part of the 2025–2026 state budget. More than 8 million residents are expected to receive payments.

Refund amounts range from $150 to $400.

New Yorkers do not need to apply; eligible taxpayers will automatically receive a cheque.

Distribution began in September 2025 and continues through December, with some payments extending into early 2026.

Eligibility is based on:

Filing a 2023 resident income tax return

Meeting income thresholds set by the state

Not being claimed as a dependent

The rebate is designed to offset the higher sales taxes residents paid due to inflation.

New Jersey: Expanded ANCHOR property tax relief

New Jersey continues to issue payments through its expanded ANCHOR property tax relief programme.

Payments for late-filed applications are being mailed throughout early December 2025.

The benefit amount varies depending on income, age and residency status for 2024.

Residents can check their application status via the New Jersey Division of Taxation website.

Pennsylvania: PTRR payments still going out

Pennsylvania is still processing and sending payments under its property tax rent rebate programme.

Residual payments for late applicants will be mailed throughout December, with some continuing into early 2026.

The programme benefits older adults, people with disabilities and low-income renters or homeowners.

Residents should use the official Commonwealth of Pennsylvania portals for updates and application tracking.

Since its launch in 1971, the programme has delivered more than $8.6 billion in financial relief.

What this means for residents

State-level relief is becoming increasingly important as national stimulus measures remain stalled.

Alaska’s dividend is expected to continue annually.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania’s property tax and rent relief schemes operate on recurring or rolling schedules.

New York’s inflation rebate is currently one-off, with any extension depending on upcoming budget decisions.





Several US states are issuing tax relief payments before the end of 2025, offering financial support to residents as inflation, rising rents and higher living costs continue to strain household budgets. While federal stimulus programmes have ended, state governments are stepping in with targeted rebates, dividends and property tax reductions to ease the pressure on families.Alaska, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are all distributing some form of tax relief or rebate this month. These payments are state-run programmes, not federal stimulus cheques, and each state has its own eligibility rules, income thresholds and payment timelines.The dividend remains one of the most reliable annual state payments in the country, though the exact amount fluctuates depending on oil revenue.ANCHOR provides relief for both homeowners and renters, making it one of the broadest property tax assistance programmes in the country.As the year ends, millions of residents across these four states will see meaningful financial support arrive just as holiday and winter expenses peak.","State-level relief is becoming increasingly important as national stimulus measures remain stalled.

US President Donald Trump unveiled a new million-dollar “gold card” immigration scheme, with his administration arguing that America must stop admitting “below-average” immigrants and instead prioritise high-earning, highly skilled applicants.Announcing the programme at the White House, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick claimed the existing system brings in immigrants who earn far less than US-born workers. “The average Green Card holder in America makes 1/3 less than the average American. We should be bringing in the best and the brightest—and that's what POTUS is changing about our immigration system,” he said.Trump revealed that applications for the new gold card had opened through a government website. The scheme offers legal residency and a pathway to citizenship for individuals who pay $1 million and for corporations willing to pay $2 million dollars per foreign employee. He said all revenue would “go to the US government” and predicted that the programme would bring in billions to a Treasury account “where we can do things positive for the country. ”The US president described the card as a more powerful version of a green card.“Basically, it's a green card but much better. Much more powerful, a much stronger path,” he said, adding that he wanted to help US companies retain “outstanding graduates” from top American universities who currently struggle to stay in the country after completing their studies. “You can't hire people from the best colleges because you don't know whether or not you can keep the person,” he said.The gold card is designed to replace the EB-5 visa scheme, created in 1990, which required around $1 million in investment and the creation of at least 10 jobs. Trump did not address job-creation requirements or any programme caps. Lutnick said each applicant would pay $15,000 for vetting, promising a rigorous background check to “make sure these people absolutely qualify to be in America.”He added that Trump wanted to shift the system away from “below-average” entrants. “So, same visas, but now just full of the best people,” he said.More than two dozen countries offer similar investor visas. Trump said the United States would now compete for top global talent, with graduates from China, India and France. “The companies are going to be very happy,” he said.",US President Donald Trump unveils new million-dollar 'gold card' immigration scheme.

'If you subtract immigration…': Top White House aide suggests US was better off favouring Western countries over third-world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-you-subtract-immigration-top-white-house-aide-suggests-us-was-better-off-favouring-western-countries-over-third-world/articleshow/125916789.cms,"Unsuccessful immigrants giving birth to unsuccessful children

If you subtract immigration, everything becomes better: Miller

Why First World countries are better according to Miller

Why Miller's views are 'biased and baseless'





Stephen Miller, White House aide and key architect of Donald Trump’s immigration policy, said that US would have been better off favouring immigrants from Western and Northern Europe over those from so-called “third world” countries.Speaking to Fox News, Miller criticised the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which prioritised skills and family reunification over country of origin, saying it had caused a lot of social problems in the US.“What you saw between 1965 and today was the single largest experiment on a society, on a civilisation, that had ever been conducted in human history,” Miller said.He claimed that immigrant communities like Somali-Americans failed to assimilate into the American culture and that their natural-born children were equally unsuccessful: “With a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example … but you see very persistent issues in every subsequent generation. You see consistent high rates of welfare use, high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate. ”Miller linked immigration to an array of societal challenges: “If you subtract immigration out of test scores, all of a sudden our test scores skyrocket! If you subtract immigration out of health care, all of a sudden we don’t have near to the size of the health care challenges our country faces. If you subtract immigration out of public safety, all of a sudden we don’t have violent crime in so many of our cities.Issue after issue we talk about these things as they things just happen to us. The schools just suddenly fail. Violent crime just suddenly explodes. The deficit just suddenly skyrockets. These are a result of social policy choices that we made through immigration.”Miller praised pre-Civil Rights era (1950-60s) immigration policies that favoured Northern and Western European countries, suggesting these earlier quotas helped form a unified national identity. He compared this to the present day, claiming that immigrants from Africa and other non-Western countries had brought negative outcomes into the US. “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country, what do you think will happen? You will replicate the conditions they left,” he said.David Bier of the Cato Institute told CNN that Miller is guided by false narratives about immigrants: “His views are baseless smears based on bias, not serious analysis. Immigrants to the United States today are assimilating faster than prior generations. They are more likely to know English, more likely to have graduated college, are more economically productive, and more beneficial to government budgets than in the early 20th century. ” Bier added that immigrants today increase productivity, wages, and living standards for US-born citizens while committing fewer crimes.","Stephen Miller, White House aide and key architect of Donald Trump’s immigration policy, said US would have been better off favouring immigrants from Western and Northern Europe.

International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Feuds, betrayal and the making of Uzair Baloch





Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan. He accuses Munir of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes, she told the publication.Read more: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail?

Noreen Niazi said, “We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel.”She added, “At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries.” She accused police of slapping and dragging other women, calling it “part of a broader and troubling pattern of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years.”Rumours over Imran’s well-being surged after unverified Afghan media reports claimed he had died in custody.

Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday said it is “strategically possible” for Dhaka to join a regional grouping with Pakistan that excludes India, amid signals from Islamabad about forming a new trilateral initiative with China and Bangladesh.Responding to a question at the foreign ministry, he said, “It is possible for us (Bangladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India.”His remarks follow Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar’s recent statement at the ‘Islamabad Conclave’ that discussions had begun on a trilateral initiative involving Pakistan, China and Bangladesh, which could later expand.Touhid said Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress,” adding that he had no further comment as he had only seen the information in media reports.He also addressed other ongoing diplomatic issues, noting that the process to lift US sanctions on the rapid action battalion (RAB) is in progress. He highlighted “significant progress” in the elite force’s operations over the past 15 years and reiterated the government’s commitment to preventing human rights violations, abductions and extrajudicial killings.Asked about the possibility of sanctions targeting Bangladeshi leaders after August 5, he dismissed the likelihood, saying he had not seen any allegations suggesting such risks. He added that discussions with the United States on the general security of military information agreement (GSOMIA) were continuing.On high visa refusal rates for Bangladeshi students and applicants, the adviser said many cases stemmed from forged documents submitted during the visa process.Earlier in June reacting to a trilateral meeting between Pakistan, China and Bangladesh and potential grouping, the ministry of external affairs had said, ""We maintain a constant watch on the developments in our neighbourhood that have a bearing on our interests and our security, our relations with individual countries, while they stand on their own footing, take into account the evolving context as well.""",Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday said it is “strategically possible” for Dhaka to join a regional grouping with Pakistan that excludes India.

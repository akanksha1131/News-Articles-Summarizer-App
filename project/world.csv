FBI warns of potential ISIS-inspired attacks similar to New Orleans tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-warns-of-potential-isis-inspired-attacks-similar-to-new-orleans-tragedy/articleshow/117220941.cms,"New video from deadly New Orleans terror attack

The FBI has warned that the deadly New Year's Day vehicle attack in New Orleans could inspire ""copycat or retaliatory attacks"" across the United States. The warning follows the New Orleans attack, in which Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a US Army veteran and ISIS sympathiser, ploughed a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more.The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are particularly concerned about the increasing use of vehicle ramming as a tactic by violent extremists, noting that attackers are often inspired by foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and may seek to replicate such actions.The authorities issued the public service announcement, adding the growing threat from “aspiring violent extremist attackers” who have increasingly used vehicles as weapons. These attacks have been carried out with rented, stolen, or personally owned vehicles, which are easy to acquire, and may be accompanied by firearms, knives, or even improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Targets have typically included pedestrians, law enforcement officers, and crowded public venues, which are easily accessible from roadways. “We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement,” the FBI urged.Jabbar’s attack in New Orleans unfolded in the early hours of January 1, when he drove a rented F-150 truck onto the pavement around a police blockade at Bourbon Street’s entrance, striking numerous people celebrating New Year’s. After exchanging gunfire with police, Jabbar was fatally shot at the scene. His vehicle was found to contain bomb-making materials, and authorities discovered that he had planted two IEDs, one of which was moved by an unsuspecting passerby before it could detonate.The FBI confirmed that Jabbar had pledged allegiance to ISIS shortly before the attack, posting videos online in which he declared his intention to wage war against ""non-believers.""In the months leading up to the attack, Jabbar conducted detailed surveillance in New Orleans, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the French Quarter and identify key targets. The FBI believes he was planning the attack for several months, even making purchases for bomb-making materials in Texas before arriving in Louisiana.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar ploughed a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more.

'Fantasy type thing': 55-year old Texas man charged for stalking WNBA star Caitlin Clark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fantasy-type-thing-texas-man-charged-for-stalking-wnba-star-caitlin-clark/articleshow/117219478.cms,"WNBA star Caitlin Clark (File photo/AP)

A Texas man faced felony stalking charges for harassing WNBA star Caitlin Clark after sending sexually explicit messages and travelling to Indiana to be in close vicinity of the basketball player.55-year-old Michael Thomas Lewis allegedly harassed the 22-year-old Indiana Fever player from December 16 till January 11, according to the Marion County prosecutor 's office. Lewis is scheduled for a court appearance Tuesday. He reportedly sent numerous messages to Clark's X account, including some that were sexually explicit, according to a sheriff's affidavit.One message claimed he drove by Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Fever plays, three times daily. Another said he had “one foot on a banana peel and the other on a stalking charge.” Prosecutors say these messages made Clark feel “terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened” and constituted an implicit or explicit threat “with the intent to place Caitlin Clark in reasonable fear of sexual battery.”Additionally, according to court documents cited by The New York Times, Clark had ""altered her public appearances and patterns of movement"" because she feared for her safety.The FBI traced the messages to Lewis and IP addresses linked to an Indianapolis hotel and library. Indianapolis police questioned Lewis at his hotel on January 8. He claimed he was on vacation but added, “Just the same reason everybody makes posts.”He denied harmful intent, claiming he fantasized about a relationship with Clark. He told police, “It’s an imagination, fantasy type thing and it’s a joke, and it’s nothing to do with threatening.” Prosecutors are requesting a higher-than-standard bond, citing Lewis's travel from Texas to Indianapolis “with the intent to be in close proximity to the victim.” They also want a stay-away order from the Gainbridge and Hinkle fieldhouses. ""No matter how prominent a figure you are, this case shows that online harassment can quickly escalate to actual threats of physical violence,"" the Marion County prosecutor, said in a statementClark, the 2024 AP Female Athlete of the Year, was the WNBA's top draft pick and Rookie of the Year after leading Iowa to the NCAA championship game last year.","Michael Thomas Lewis, 55, allegedly harassed the 22-year-old Indiana Fever player from December 16 till January 11.

'Ban flow of critical minerals': Ex-Trudeau ally Jagmeet Singh responds to threats by 'bully' Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ban-flow-of-critical-minerals-ex-trudeau-ally-jagmeet-singh-responds-to-threats-by-bully-donald-trump/articleshow/117219588.cms,"Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh responded sharply to threats made by US president-elect Donald Trump , warning that such actions could harm Canada’s economy and workforce.Singh described Trump’s recent tariff threats as a “clear” danger to Canadian jobs and warned they could further burden citizens already grappling with rising living costs. “Donald Trump is a clear threat to Canada,” Singh said.“His tariff threats are directly threatening hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs. They also threaten to increase the cost of living at a time when people are already struggling with the cost of groceries and the cost of their bills. So it is serious. We have to take it seriously.”Singh, who previously helped Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintain a minority government, has been a vocal critic of the Liberal Party’s handling of key domestic issues. He also expressed frustration with the government’s inability to effectively address the challenges posed by Trump’s threats. “Going to meet with them, trying to wine and dine them, is a failed approach,” Singh said.“Donald Trump is not rational. You can't discuss a plan over a meal with him. He is a bully. And bullies understand one thing: strength.”He further elaborated that if Trump is serious about escalating tensions, Canada must respond in kind. “If he wants to pick a fight with Canada, we have to make sure it's clear that it's going to hurt Americans as well. There’s going to be pain felt for not just Canadians, but also Americans,” Singh warned.His solution is straightforward: “We know that the United States needs our critical minerals. They're very important for the United States. So I'm calling on all political leaders to support turning off the taps on those critical minerals.”Singh argued that halting the flow of vital minerals to the US could be an effective way to force Trump to reconsider his aggressive stance. “There’s no quicker way to get Donald Trump to back away from tariffs than to shut off the tap on critical minerals that the States need very clearly,” Singh asserted.Singh’s comments come as tensions between the US and Canada escalate following Trump’s controversial remarks suggesting that Canada could become the 51st state. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump reiterated his belief that dissolving the “artificially drawn line” between the two nations would benefit both countries, particularly in terms of national security.In response, Singh took a strong stance, rejecting any notion of Canada’s integration into the United States. “I have a message for Donald Trump. Our country's not for sale. Not now, not ever,” Singh declared. “I’ve lived across this country, and I can tell you Canadians are a proud people. We're proud of our country, and we're ready to fight like hell to defend it.”This call for action echoes Singh’s broader critique of Trudeau's leadership, which has faced criticism over the handling of rising living costs, housing, and healthcare.Despite the looming threat from the US, Singh believes the Trudeau administration has failed to prioritise the protection of Canadian jobs and sovereignty. “We’ve got serious threats of Donald Trump and tariffs that put in question hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs,” Singh said.","Singh described Trump’s recent tariff threats as a “clear’ danger to Canadian jobs and warned they could further burden citizens already grappling with rising living costs. “Donald Trump is not rational.

The TomTom Traffic Index 2024 provides insights into the degree of traffic situations in 500 cities across 62 countries regarding their travel times and levels of congestion and how this will affect people. Data to be used from over 600 million connected devices, which could include an in-car navigation system or through applications of TomTom accessed on a mobile phone. This is a global study of the average time spent travelling, the level of congestion, and how these factors compare across different regions and cities. Even interesting is that three Indian cities have made it to this list: Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Pune, with Kolkata emerging as one of the most congested cities in the world.Barranquilla, a port city in northern Colombia, has the highest average travel time globally. Commuters face 36 minutes and 6 seconds for every 10 kilometers traveled. It has taken the top spot of most congested cities in TomTom Traffic Index 2024. When a city congests at 45 percent, it means nearly half of the time spent in a journey is on wait due to traffic. For instance, when it is rush hour, commuters will have lost up to 130 hours per year. The more the city's roads improve for 20 seconds from 2023, there is still not enough to carry the population with the number of vehicles on the road. For congestion severity, Barranquilla ranks at 16 in the world; this means, although there are improvements, the traffic is one of the key issues for most commuters. This is a chronic problem that affects the daily lives of the residents, and there is an urgent need for better traffic management strategies in the city.Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal, India ranks second globally in traffic congestion according to the TomTom Traffic Index 2024. On average, for every 10 kilometers, travel time in the city is up by 10 seconds at 34 minutes and 33 seconds compared to last year. Though not significant, such a rise led to Kolkata suffering from a congestion level of 32%, thereby leaving out 110 hours a year for commuters. The city ranks 169th globally for congestion intensity, which means, though the congestion level is high, the proportion of lost time is not so critical. Roadways in Kolkata become congested mainly due to a lack of infrastructures for the roads, and it is coupled with a crowded population and lack of regulation with traffic flow results in serious delays during peak times. The level of demand for transportation increases due to urbanization thus, the local government needs to oversee the traffic.Bengaluru or Bangalore is among the tech cities of India rated third globally for traffic congestion. The average travel time per 10 kilometers in the city had reached 34 minutes and 10 seconds, higher by 50 seconds from last year. Bengaluru stands at 38%, which means the delay on roads in traffic accounts for approximately 38% of time consumption. Hence, this brings forth an average loss of 117 hours of yearly time consumption in rush hours. This makes the city rank 64th globally on the congestion level and thus depicts the massive but not terrible congestion of the city. Traffic woes in Bengaluru are largely owed to the rate of urbanization, an ever-increasing count of IT professionals, and antique infrastructure which are unable to cater to the phenomenal growth in this city. The problem is further compounded by there not being sufficient public transport options and it depends so much on private vehicles, making it the most congested city in India.The fourth rank-holding city in traffic congestion is Pune, the other major city in India. Travel time in the city improved by 1 minute from what it was last year as it took, on average, 33 minutes and 22 seconds to cover every 10 kilometers. Even at a congestion level of 34%, Pune is not the worst because it fares marginally better compared with other cities: 108 hours a year of lost time for commuters, thereby placing it 128th in intensity. The rapid growth in population, coupled with increased vehicle ownership, and also because it's an educational as well as industrial hub, forces the city into traffic challenges. Although infrastructure work is in place, the city still faces congestion during peak hours particularly in high density areas and at busy roads.London is the capital city of the United Kingdom and comes fifth in traffic congestion globally. The travel time for 10 kilometers is 33 minutes and 17 seconds, an improvement of 40 seconds from the previous year 2023. With a congestion level of 32%, London commuters lose 113 hours annually due to traffic congestion, making it rank 150th globally by congestion severity. London's traffic congestion is caused by a number of factors: an ever-growing population, insufficient road capacity, and reliance on both private and public transport. Despite all efforts to reduce congestion by implementing measures such as the Congestion Charge Zone, the volume of vehicles remains very high. It includes the London Underground expansion, other public transports to alleviate the long-term city solution of traffic congestion.Kyoto is the oldest city in Japan, ranked as the sixth biggest in terms of traffic congestion worldwide. The average time spent in traveling 10 kilometers was 33 minutes and 16 seconds; an increase from last year 2023 of 20 seconds. Kyoto suffers at a level of 39% congestion; a loss of 95 hours a year through delayed traffic. Kyoto's congestion is significant but less severe than in many other global cities, which has earned it a global congestion rank of 60. The city's roadways are relatively well-maintained but experience congestion during peak tourist seasons and with increasing urban development. Kyoto's historical significance and popularity among tourists contribute to heavy traffic, particularly in the central districts. Local authorities are trying to balance the demands of tourism, local traffic, and environmental concerns.Lima city is the capital and the most populous in Peru. In terms of ranking of the city in the world, it is ranked seventh, concerning traffic congestion. The average time taken in traveling 10 km is now 33 minutes and 12 seconds, which has gone up by 1 minute and 30 seconds since last year, 2023. At a congestion level of 47%, Lima is among the cities that have the worst level of congestion in the world, leading to 155 hours per commuter lost on time in a year. That ranks Lima at 9th worldwide in severity. Rapid urbanization and increasing population drive the traffic congestion in Lima, combined with minimal infrastructure. It has therefore contributed to inefficient public transportation systems compelling its residents to rely mostly on private vehicles, which worsen the situation.Davao City in the Philippines ranked eighth globally for traffic congestion, with an average travel time per 10 kilometers of 32 minutes and 59 seconds. This is a 30-second improvement from 2023. Despite this slight improvement, the city has a high 49% congestion level, meaning that 49% of time spent in traffic is lost to congestion. This leads to a yearly loss of 136 hours, and positions Davao City third globally in terms of congestion intensity. Its congestion is mainly fueled by the rapid growth in urbanization, limited infrastructure, and dependence on private vehicles. Davao City's local government does its best in making better public transport available and improving traffic management, but fast growth keeps challenging the city's road systems.The coastal city of Trujillo in Peru is the ninth most congested city in the world. The average travel time per 10 kilometers takes 32 minutes and 56 seconds, adding up 30 seconds from the last survey in 2023. The city accounts for a congestion level of 34%, and its residents spend 102 hours annually wasting time in their daily commutes owing to traffic congestion, positioning Trujillo at number 119 on the congestion intensity list globally. As one of the fastest-growing cities in Peru, Trujillo faces challenges in terms of managing the growing population and increasing numbers of vehicles. The relatively limited road infrastructure of the city, combined with urban sprawl, contributes to its growing traffic woes.Dublin, the capital of Ireland, ranks tenth in the world in terms of traffic congestion. The city travel time per 10 kilometers is 32 minutes and 45 seconds, 40 seconds more than in 2023. The congestion level is at 47%, which means it is equal to 155 hours of lost time yearly for commuters; it stands at the 10th position worldwide concerning the severity of congestion. The causes of congestion in Dublin are the high density of the urban environment, few public transport options, and growing numbers of vehicles. Despite an increased public transportation network in the city, traffic still remains a major problem, majorly during rush hours.","The TomTom Traffic Index 2024 provides insights into the degree of traffic situations in 500 cities across 62 countries.

LA Inferno: Winds, Lightning Or Arson? U.S. Officials 'Clueless' About What Led To California Fires

Four lawsuits were filed Monday against Southern California Edison, alleging their responsibility for the Eaton fire , which erupted during a severe windstorm and caused extensive property damage.Legal representatives of Altadena residents announced these actions, representing clients who experienced evacuation or complete loss of their homes in the Eaton fire, accordin to LA Times' report. The lawsuits cite the fire's origin beneath a Southern California Edison transmission tower, though official investigations remain incomplete.Attorney Richard Bridgford, representing a local homeowner, said, ""We believe that the Eaton fire was ignited because of SCE's failure to de-energize its overhead wires, which traverse Eaton Canyon.""The additional lawsuits represent diverse claimants- a FedEx employee who lost their Altadena residence, a property owner who leased their Altadena property, and multiple Altadena homeowners, all presenting similar allegations.Ali Moghaddas from Edelson PC, counsel for the FedEx employee, criticised the utility company's inadequate response despite advance weather warnings. ""They chose not to use all the tools at their disposal,"" he claimed.Meanwhile, attorney Gerald Singleton, representing a landlord, emphasised the importance of early legal action to preserve evidence. Alexander Robertson, representing several Altadena residents, criticised the company's decision to maintain power during severe weather conditions.Jeff Monford, the utility's spokesperson, acknowledged awareness of the lawsuits but says the the firm has not been served yet, stating their commitment to supporting affected communities whilst maintaining that their transmission tower was not responsible.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection continues its investigation, with LA Times reporting that Cal Fire secured the transmission tower site where the fire allegedly originated.Whilst the lawsuits reference Southern California Edison's previous wildfire incidents, experts like Michael Wara from Stanford University's Climate and Energy Policy Program advise against premature conclusions.The Eaton fire, which began at 6.15 pm (local time) on January 7, has resulted in 17 fatalities and extensive structural damage, with containment at 33%.","Four lawsuits were filed Monday against Southern California Edison, alleging their responsibility for the Eaton fire.

Jeff Bezos does not think SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will use his close ties with US President-elect Trump to undercut Bezos’ rival space company Blue Origin, and was “very optimistic” about the incoming administration’s space agenda.The inaugural launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, tasked with eventually launching the company’s moon lander for Nasa, was due early on Monday after several delays, but was postponed for at least another day due to a lastminute issue with the vehicle.New Glenn is a 30-storeytall rocket that is expected to chip away at SpaceX’s market dominance and kickstart Blue Origin’s long-delayed entrance in the satellite launch business. “Elon has been very clear that he’s doing this for the public interest and not for his personal gain. And I take him at face value,” Bezos, founder of Blue Origin, said Sunday.Musk, who has spent more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump, has had the latter’s ear on space matters. Last month, Musk said the US should send missions straight to Mars instead of to the moon first, fuelling industry concerns of a major shakeup to Nasa’s space exploration programme . “My own opinion is that we should do both — we need to go to the moon and we should go to Mars,” Bezos said, when asked if he was concerned about changes to moon programme. “What we shouldn’t do is start and stop things. We should continue with the lunar programme for sure.”","Jeff Bezos does not think SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will use his close ties with US President-elect Trump to undercut Bezos' rival space company Blue Origin.

Bezos’ Blue Origin stands down on debut launch of New Glenn rocket

Blue Origin will try to launch the massive New Glenn rocket again on Tuesday, a day after calling off the highly-anticipated launch on Monday due to technical issues.Blue Origin, the space company founded by Amazon ’s Jeff Bezos , faced another hurdle in its quest to launch the rocket on Monday due to ice accumulation in a purge line essential to the rocket's hydraulic systems. The 320-foot-tall rocket was supposed to carry a prototype satellite, marking a significant milestone for the company.Tuesday has been identified as the next possible launch date, but weather forecasts predict thick clouds and strong winds at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, potentially causing further delays.The test flight had already been postponed earlier due to rough seas, which posed a risk to the planned recovery of the rocket’s first-stage booster on a floating platform in the Atlantic.The New Glenn is said to be a key step in Bezos’ 25-year vision for advancing human spaceflight and expanding access to orbit. Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, New Glenn is five times taller than Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, which is used for short suborbital trips.Jeff Bezos himself participated in Monday’s countdown from Mission Control near Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center. Speaking to his team over the weekend, Bezos expressed determination, saying, “We’re going to pick ourselves up and keep going.”Despite delays, Blue Origin aims to compete with Elon Musk-owned SpaceX by showcasing New Glenn’s capabilities, including its partially reusable design and ability to carry heavier payloads than SpaceX’s Falcon 9.","Blue Origin, the space company founded by Amazon ’s Jeff Bezos, faced another hurdle in its quest to launch the rocket on Monday due to ice accumulation in a purge line essential to the rocket's hydraulic systems.

Justice Department releases Hunter Biden special counsel report

What were the charges against Hunter Biden?

Special counsel David Weiss defended his investigation into Hunter Biden on Monday, rejecting US President Joe Biden's claims of mistreatment in an attempt to target him.In a new report, Weiss, the lead prosecutor in the probes, stated the gun and tax charges against the president's son stemmed from impartial investigations, not politics.President Biden pardoned his son last month, citing what he called a “miscarriage of justice” and selective prosecution. He stated his son was treated “differently” due to his last name.“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,” Biden said.Weiss countered these claims directly. “The president’s characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong,” Weiss wrote.Weiss emphasised that the prosecutions demonstrated equal application of the law. “Far from selective, these prosecutions were the embodiment of the equal application of justice — no matter who you are, or what your last name is, you are subject to the same laws as everyone else in the United States,” Weiss said. He also criticized the president for using the pardon to attack the Justice Department. He wrote that no other president had used a pardon to ""malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.""The legal proceedings against Hunter Biden originated from his conviction in June 2023 on three felony charges concerning a firearm acquisition in 2018. He provided false information on his firearm application form regarding his substance use status. These charges emerged from an extensive investigation into his activities, which were connected to his substance dependency issues. The federal court pursued the case to conviction, despite the contextual circumstances.Joe Biden offered support for his son's situation, noting that similar cases typically avoid criminal prosecution, particularly when substance dependency is a factor. He mentioned that Hunter Biden has maintained sobriety for more than five years whilst facing these legal challenges.In September 2024, Hunter Biden entered a guilty plea for nine tax-related offences, involving unpaid taxes exceeding $1.4 million from earnings he utilised for luxury expenditures, including escorts, substances, and vehicles. The investigation, which commenced in 2018, led to these charges. His defence team contended that he received disproportionate scrutiny from Republicans, with allegations that the prosecution was politically driven to undermine Joe Biden's presidential aspirations. The presidential pardon nullified any potential imprisonment for these tax violations.","US President Joe Biden pardoned his son last month, citing what he called a “miscarriage of justice” and selective prosecution.

But when certain movies become ""events"" unto themselves, sometimes different behaviour accompanies them. During the theatrical run of ""Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour"" last fall, fans danced and belted lyrics in the theatres. Last year, fans at early screenings of ""Wicked"" did the same, to the chagrin of other filmgoers. One video of a woman dressed as Glinda the Good Witch racked up over a million views for announcing in theatre, ""I'm here to hear Cynthia and Ariana sing, not you.""When asked whether it's appropriate for fans to sing in the theatre, ""Wicked"" star Cynthia Erivo , who plays Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, said she thinks the practice is "" wonderful"". Dwayne Johnson, who stars in ""Moana 2"", said theatergoers who have spent ""hard earned money for a ticket"" should be able to sing.Online backlash was swift, with one user retorting, ""I paid my hard-earned money for a ticket too and I don't wanna hear y'all attempting to sing so what now"". It all circles around two questions that, like anything else in the culture, are constantly evolving: When you're seeing a film in a theatre, how should you behave? And when can a viewer become a participant?The instinct to join in is hardly new. ""Sing-along screenings have been a principal part of moviegoing going back over 100 years,"" says Ross Melnick, a professor of film studies at the University of California. But singing, he said, typically occured in ""designated sing-along environments"". Film expert Esther Morgan-Ellis said American film screenings in the late 1920s and early 1930s were often preceded by sing-alongs .To allow visitors to choose their preferred viewing experience, the Main Cinema in Minneapolis declared 'Wicked' screenings on Mondays (and ""Mondays only"") as singing-friendly. To draw people back to the theatre, movie distributors and theatres have expanded the types of experiences they offer. ACX Cinemas hired actors to dress as characters from ""Wicked"" and ""Moana"" to take photos with visitors. Attendees at a special ""Magic Mike XXL"" screening were given fake money to throw at the screen.

At least 16 people were missing, a number authorities said was also likely to rise.Fierce Santa Ana winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighbourhoods. In less than a week, four fires around the nation's second biggest city have ignited more than 160sqkm, roughly three times the size of Manhattan.Most of that destruction has been from the Eaton Fire near Pasadena and the Palisades Fire , in a wealthy enclave along the Pacific Coast.

Vetting began last week, the official added.Trump's pick for national security adviser, Mike Waltz , in recent days publicly signalled his intention to get rid of all nonpolitical appointees and career intelligence officials serving on the NSC by Inauguration Day to ensure the council is staffed with those who support Trump's agenda.

""Those folks were awesome. They were really good."" Trump, during his first term, was scarred when two career military officers detailed to the NSC became whistleblowers, raising concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian Prez Volodymyr Zelensky in which he sought a probe of Biden and his son Hunter.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet.

""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody.

Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail. He called for a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117150678,imgsize-563011,width-400,resizemode-4/117150678.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said. The Chinese-funded airport was inaugurated by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in October.The airport, Pakistan's largest, is located in restive southwestern Balochistan province and is part of a massive investment by Beijing that links a deep seaport and airport on the Arabian Sea by road with China.","The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.

Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We’re Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA’s marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there’s Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)—an entity so hilariously unpredictable that it’s essentially become the aviation world’s sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for “divine intervention,” PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline’s X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: “Paris, we are coming today.” The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, “First, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they’re going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!” Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, “PIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‘Final Destination.’” Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, “This marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.”The tweet also reignited memories of PIA’s greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, “First it was goats, now it’s global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.” @cruindggn added, “At this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‘Oops Air’ and own it.” User @saikirankannan chimed in with, “Next stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‘We’re just helping it lean a little more.’”Others couldn’t help but connect the mishap to Pakistan’s controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country’s global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA’s PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet’s imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained—whether it’s on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

ACC chief Akhter Hossain accused Hasina and her family of allocating lucrative land plots for personal gain. Among those implicated are her niece, Tulip Siddiq , a British government minister, and her daughter, Saima Wazed, a senior UN official. Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy , and sister, Sheikh Rehana, are also named in the case.ACC investigations revealed that Hasina’s government misused its power, allegedly funnelling $5 billion connected to the Russian-backed $12.65 billion Rooppur nuclear power plant . Interim Bangladeshi leader Muhammad Yunus has demanded a full probe, calling it “plain robbery” from the national treasury.The scandal has also gained attention in the UK, where Siddiq faces increasing pressure to step down as the country’s anti-corruption minister. A Sunday Times investigation revealed that Siddiq lived in properties in London linked to Hasina’s government and associates of the Awami League. One of these flats was reportedly bought by an offshore company connected to Bangladeshi businessmen and later gifted to a barrister with ties to Hasina.Siddiq referred herself to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s standards adviser earlier this month, insisting she has “done nothing wrong.” Senior minister Pat McFadden defended her decision, saying, “That is the right way to deal with this.” However, opposition figures disagree. Conservative finance spokesperson Mel Stride said, “It’s inappropriate for Tulip to be in the position that she holds at the moment.”As Siddiq represents a north London constituency and oversees UK financial services, her alleged connections to her aunt’s government have raised serious ethical questions. Bangladeshi investigators have requested bank transaction records linked to Siddiq as part of their ongoing probe.","Allegations include large-scale land grabbing in Dhaka and the embezzlement of billions linked to a Russian-funded nuclear project.

Iran Street Fire: 500+ Killed, Say Activists As Tehran Blames Israel & U.S. For Unrest | WATCH





The United States on Monday issued an advisory asking American citizens to “leave Iran now” amid massive unrest going on in Islamic Republic, warning that protests against the Khamenei regime across the country are “escalating” and could “turn violent”, leading to “arrests, injuries and severe disruptions” to daily life.In the advisory, the US embassy said that protests across Iran “may turn violent” as Iranian authorities step up security measures.“Protests across Iran are escalating and may turn violent, resulting in arrests and injuries. Increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages are ongoing,” the alert said.It added that the Iranian government has “restricted access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks.”The advisory also warned of travel disruptions, noting that several airlines have limited or cancelled flights to and from Iran. “Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran, with several suspending service until Friday, January 16,” it said.Urging immediate caution, the embassy advised US citizens to consider leaving Iran by land through Armenia and Turkey.“US citizens should expect continued internet outages, plan alternative means of communication, and, if safe to do so, consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye,” the alert added.“Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said.For those unable to leave, the embassy advised finding a safe place and keeping essential supplies. “If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added.“Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings,” the embassy said, urging citizens to follow local media updates and stay flexible with travel plans.The advisory also highlighted serious risks for US nationals, especially “dual citizens”. “US-Iranian dual nationals must exit Iran on Iranian passports. The Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens,” it said.“US nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran,” the advisory said, adding that “showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone.”However, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also issued warning to America, and wrote on X: ""Iran's great nation showcased its resolve and identity to its enemies. This was a warning to US politicians to cease their deceptions and not rely on treacherous mercenaries.""The advisory comes amid reports of large demonstrations across several provinces, including Azerbaijan province and the central city of Arak. According to Iran’s state-run Press TV, crowds were seen waving flags and chanting slogans in support of Iran. The protests and counter-protests follow days of unrest linked to rising inflation, economic hardship and public anger over governance.At least 646 people have been killed and more than 10,000 individuals have been arrested and sent to prisons.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has taken a hard stance against the Khamenei-led regime, including moves to target countries doing business with Iran. He stepped up pressure by announcing a 25 per cent tariff with immediate effect.Trump said the tariffs would apply immediately. In a social media post, he wrote, “Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America.”","The U.S. embassy in Tehran issued an advisory asking American citizens to “leave Iran now” It warned that protests across Iran “may turn violent” as Iranian authorities step up security measures.

Scientists find unexpected marine life living on plastic garbage in the Pacific



Coastal animals should not survive there

Plastic is working as a home for these species

Are these animals just passing through

Some of these species are related to Japan

What this means for the ocean

Plastic drifts across the Pacific in no particular hurry. Some pieces have been moving for years, thinning and softening as the sun and salt work on them. Far from land, where the sea usually offers little to cling to, those fragments have started to matter differently. Small animals have found them. They stay. They grow. Some even reproduce. This was not what scientists expected to see when they began pulling plastic from the middle of the ocean. The open sea was meant to be too exposed, too empty. But the plastic remains. It floats. It lasts. And slowly, almost quietly, it is being used. The garbage patch is still polluted. It is also now inhabited.The study published in Nature , came from a close look at 105 large pieces of plastic collected from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. This is the slow-moving system of currents where floating debris tends to gather. Nearly all of the items carried life. Barnacles were common. So were crabs, amphipods, sea anemones and other small invertebrates. In total, researchers counted 46 different kinds of animals. Many of them were not supposed to be there at all. They normally live near coasts, attached to rocks or harbour walls. Yet here they were, thousands of kilometres from shore.For a long time, scientists assumed the open ocean was off limits to coastal species. There is no seabed to anchor to and little shelter from waves or predators. Food is less predictable. Conditions change fast. The idea was that coastal animals lacked the ability to cope with this. What the plastic shows is something simpler. The problem may never have been the water. It may have been the lack of a surface. Once that surface appeared, in the form of floating waste, the rules shifted.Not all debris is equal. Nets and ropes turned out to host the most life. Their twisted shapes create pockets and shade. They offer grip. Some pieces had clearly been at sea for many years, worn down to a thin and brittle state. Still, they held on. These objects act like small rafts. Over time, they collect layers of organisms, some feeding, some sheltering, some just staying put. It is not a reef. It is not land. But it is enough.They are not only clinging on. Many are breeding. Scientists found females carrying eggs and signs of different growth stages on the same object. Young people and adults shared the space. Sea anemones showed several size classes living together. This suggests more than chance arrival. It points to persistence. Some species reproduce without needing a mate or release young that settle quickly. Those traits may help them survive long journeys on drifting plastic.Most of the animals identified trace back to the western Pacific. Several are known from the coast of Japan. A few pieces of debris even carried markings from East Asia, though most plastic had lost any clear sign of origin. Tsunami-related debris from past events may have played a role, but the broader picture is movement. Plastic travels easily. Life goes with it. Over time, species from one coastline can end up established far beyond their usual range.This new floating community is sometimes called neopelagic. It exists because the plastic exists. It does not replace natural ecosystems. It alters them. Coastal species now mix with open ocean ones on the same debris. How that affects food webs, or competition, is still unclear. There is no neat ending here. The plastic problem remains. What has changed is the understanding. The high seas are not as empty as they once seemed. They are being reshaped, slowly, by what we leave behind.","Scientists find unexpected marine life living on plastic garbage in the Pacific. Many of them were not supposed to be there at all.

"Australia moves India into highest-risk category for student visas, cites 'emerging integrity risks'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-moves-india-into-highest-risk-category-for-student-visas-cites-emerging-integrity-risks/articleshow/126464773.cms,"US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

What does this re-rating mean for Indian students?

Why India moved to 'highest- risk' category?





Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India as it moved India into the 'highest-risk' category along with Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. The new categorization came into effect from January 8 2026, as these four South-Asian countries have been moved from Evidence Level 2 to Evidence Level 3 under the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF).The re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, the Australian media reported, while the administration said this was triggered by ""emerging integrity risks"".“This change will assist with the effective management of emerging integrity issues, while continuing to facilitate genuine students seeking a quality education in Australia,” the administration said. “The Australian government wants all students to have a positive study experience during their stay in Australia and receive a high-quality education. It is important that Australia’s international education system and Student Visa Program has the right settings to provide international students with confidence they are investing in the best possible education,"" they said.Indian students applying for a visa in Australia will be screened meticulously. They may be asked for more documents, and there might be rigorous background checks. Bank statements will be manually verified, additional English language evidence may be requested and the officers will have the authority to call institutions, referees.The process time of applications will lengthen from three to eight weeks.Though the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category, the move came after reports of fake degree busts in India, which created a ripple in the international media. India alone accounts for almost 140,000 of Australia’s 650,000 international students, and the four nations represent nearly one-third of 2025 enrolments.According to experts, Australia remains the only option now among the 'big four' student destinations, as the US, UK and Canada are shutting their doors to foreign students. “It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, said.“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level then it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”","Australia has moved India into the 'highest-risk' category along with Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan.

'DON'T NEED AMERICA': Canada PM Carney CRAWLS To Xi Jinping In Big Shock To Trump & U.S.

Testy relations

'Turning point'

Cosying up to China





BEIJING: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will head to Beijing on Tuesday to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, hoping for closer ties as he looks to reduce his country's dependence on the United States.The trip will be the first by a Canadian leader in almost a decade, as the two sides seek to turn the page on a series of diplomatic spats.Here is why the visit is significant and what it could mean for China-Canada relations:Carney will visit China from Tuesday to Saturday, and is scheduled to meet with Xi and Premier Li Qiang, among other government and business leaders.It will be Carney's first official trip to China as prime minister, and the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since Justin Trudeau's in December 2017.Canada's relations with China have been among the worst of any Western nation. But Carney and Xi in late October held the first formal talks between the countries' leaders since 2017, with the Chinese president inviting the Canadian to visit.Carney's visit will aim to ""elevate engagement on trade, energy, agriculture, and international security"", his office said in a statement on Wednesday.Ties fell into a deep freeze in 2018 after the arrest of the daughter of Huawei's founder on a US warrant in Vancouver, and China's retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.Ottawa and Beijing have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's products, including Canadian canola used to make cooking oil, animal feed and biodiesel.Carney announced in July a 25 percent tariff on steel imports that contain steel melted and poured in China.The following month, Beijing imposed a painful temporary customs duty of 75.8 percent on canola imports from Canada, which is among the world's top producers of the crop.China has also been accused of interfering in Canadian elections in recent years.The G7, which Canada is a member of, in late October announced new projects aimed at reducing China's dominance of critical mineral supply chains.The first sign of warming ties came in late October with Xi and Carney's meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in October.The Canadian premier called it a ""turning point"" in relations, and said he raised tricky topics such as the alleged Chinese interference in Canadian elections, saying it was ""important to have that discussion"" to get relations ""back on track"".The leaders discussed ""respective sensitivities regarding issues including agriculture and agri-food products, such as canola, as well as seafood and electric vehicles"", according to a Canadian statement.Meanwhile, Xi told Carney that China-Canada relations have ""shown a recovery toward a trend of positive development"" recently with joint efforts of both sides.China was willing to work with Canada to bring relations ""back to the right track"", Xi added.While Canadian foreign policy has for years been hawkish towards China, US President Donald Trump's mercurial trade policies and aggression towards allies could prompt a pivot.The majority of US-Canada trade remains tariff-free, but Canada has been hit particularly hard by Trump's global tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber -- due to the interconnected nature of the neighbouring economies.Trump also previously hiked tariffs on Canada by 10 percent over an anti-tariff ad campaign that featured late US president Ronald Reagan.In October, Carney said Canada should double its non-US exports by 2035 to reduce reliance on the United States.US-Canada trade was worth more than $900 billion in 2024, US government data showed.Canada was also outraged by Trump's calls last year for it to become the 51st US state.With Canada and China both heavily targeted by Trump's tariffs, Carney and Xi will likely try to dial down trade tensions between their two countries.China is Canada's second-largest trade partner, Carney's office said, totalling C$118.7 billion ($85.5 billion) in two-way merchandise trade in 2024.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit China from Tuesday to Saturday.

Bill Gates sends $7.9 billion to Melinda Gates’ nonprofit in one of the biggest charity transfers ever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-sends-7-9-billion-to-melinda-gates-nonprofit-in-one-of-the-biggest-charity-transfers-ever/articleshow/126468580.cms,"$7.9 billion transfer part of post-divorce agreement

What Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation does

Mental health resources for young people

Efforts aimed at reducing political violence

Programmes supporting women’s participation and leadership in the workplace

A major shift in philanthropic power





Bill Gates has transferred $7.9 billion to a nonprofit controlled by Melinda Gates, according to recent tax filings, marking one of the largest single charitable transfers ever reported. The move dramatically expands the scale of Melinda Gates’ independent philanthropic work and immediately places her foundation among the world’s most highly capitalised private charities.The funds were transferred in late 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, the tax-exempt foundation arm of Melinda Gates’ broader organisation, Pivotal Ventures. Public filings show that once the transfer was completed, the foundation ranked among the largest private philanthropic entities globally by assets.The donation was made under a $12.5 billion agreement reached in 2024, after Bill and Melinda Gates decided to end their joint philanthropic work at the Gates Foundation, which they built together over several decades. The couple divorced in 2021 but initially continued collaborating through the foundation.A spokesperson for Pivotal confirmed that the $7.9 billion transfer was part of that agreement and that the commitment has now been fulfilled in full.The Gates Foundation did not respond to requests for comment regarding the filing.Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation was established in 2022 and operates alongside Pivotal Ventures, which Melinda Gates has led for more than a decade. While Pivotal Ventures blends grant-making with venture-style investments, the foundation structure allows for large-scale, long-term charitable funding.According to its most recent tax filing, the foundation distributed $875 million in 2024 alone. Its funding supports initiatives primarily focused in the United States, while also engaging with partners and organisations that operate internationally. Key areas of work include:The filing shows the foundation operates with a relatively small leadership structure. Melinda Gates is listed as a director, alongside senior advisers responsible for governance, finance and oversight.Beyond the headline figure, the transfer represents a significant rebalancing of philanthropic influence. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates jointly shaped global giving through the Gates Foundation. This move places nearly $8 billion under Melinda Gates’ sole philanthropic direction, giving her independent authority to define priorities and deploy capital at scale.Before the transfer became public, Bill Gates’ net worth stood at about $118 billion, while Melinda Gates was valued at $17.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Single donations of this magnitude are exceptionally rare, even among the world’s wealthiest individuals. Unlike pledges spread across decades, the Gates transfer involved nearly $8 billion moved at once, immediately reshaping the balance of assets in global philanthropy.In scale, structure and timing, Bill Gates’ $7.9 billion transfer to Melinda Gates’ nonprofit stands as one of the most consequential charity movements of the modern era.",Bill Gates has transferred $7.9 billion to a nonprofit controlled by Melinda Gates.

Anti‑Iranian protests in Los Angeles turn chaotic after truck drives into crowd — What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/antiiranian-protests-in-los-angeles-turn-chaotic-after-truck-drives-into-crowd-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/126492172.cms,"



A peaceful demonstration in support of protests in Iran turned chaotic on Sunday in Los Angeles when a U‑Haul truck drove into a crowd of demonstrators.The rally drew hundreds of people expressing solidarity with anti‑Iranian regime protests abroad. Video and eyewitness accounts show the truck entering the area around 3.30pm, causing protesters to scramble out of the way as it moved through the street. Officers later stopped the vehicle several blocks away and took the driver into custody. One person was struck by the truck but did not suffer serious injuries, and others declined medical transport after being checked by emergency crews.After the truck entered the crowd, many protesters swarmed the vehicle. Footage shows people surrounding the truck, smashing its windows, attempting to remove signs from its side and confronting the driver. Some demonstrators tried to pull the driver out of the vehicle and struck it with flagpoles before police pushed the crowd back. Authorities eventually escorted the driver into custody as the situation remained tense at the scene.Los Angeles police confirmed that the adult male driver was detained “pending further investigation”.Captain Mike Bland of the LAPD said the incident is under review and could lead to assault charges, with the vehicle being treated as a possible deadly weapon.The identity of the driver or the details are still not public as of Monday. The truck displayed political slogans referencing Iran’s 1953 coup, but officials have not called the event a terrorist act. Law enforcement has asked for witness footage and statements to help clarify what occurred.The protest in Westwood was part of a wave of demonstrations by Iranian communities and supporters across the world reacting to protests and a harsh government response in Iran itself. Unrest in the Middle East has drawn global attention, with many in the diaspora calling for change and an end to violent crackdowns under the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.","A U‑Haul truck drove into a crowd of demonstrators in Los Angeles.

Bidets and cats: Zohran Mamdani reveals his plans for Gracie Mansion as he moves in with wife Rama Duwaji,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidets-and-cats-zohran-mamdani-reveals-his-plans-for-gracie-mansion-as-he-moves-in-with-wife-rama-duwaji/articleshow/126494652.cms,"Zohran Mamdani's quirky plans for Gracie Mansion



What lies inside Gracie Mansion?



What prompted Mamdani to move to the Gracie Mansion?







New York mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife Rama Duwaji have officially moved into the Gracie Mansion, the official mayor's residence in Manhattan. The 34-year-old mayor held a press conference at the mansion on January 12, 2026 addressing the media about the move and his plans for the historical 11,000 square foot home on the Upper East Side.“Today is moving day. Tonight will be the first night that I sleep in Gracie. … We are so grateful to all of those who have already welcomed us to the Upper East Side, and I’m delighted to be back in the borough where I grew up, within walking distance of many of the museums that I went to as a teenager in this city,” Mamdani told the reporters during the conference.However, he was quick to emphasise that the 18th-century mansion is not meant to feel like a private estate, repeatedly framing it as “the people’s house,” and sharing some of his plans for it.“Gracie has lived many lives,” he said. “And that legacy is not one that should be relegated to the past.”Mamdani claimed he wanted to keep the mansion accessible and welcoming to New Yorkers who didn't get invited inside typically, promising to keep the space open beyond ceremonial events and formal receptions.When asked what he plans to alter inside the mansion, he said decisions were still forthcoming but there were a few domestic priorities.One of them was installing bidets, plumbing fixtures that help people clean themselves after using the bathroom. “One thing that we will change is we will be installing a few bidets into Gracie Mansion,” he said. “That’s an aspirational hope. We’ll see if we can actually get it done. ”Additionally, the mayor revisited his desire to get a cat. He noted that due to his feline allergies, the same wasn't possible before but he is currently undergoing allergy shots to make that possible. “I am currently getting my allergy shots so that I can fight off my allergy to cats,” he said. “That’s the hope.”However, Mamdani was insistent on addressing that despite his address, his day-to-day habits would remain intact. He said he still plans to take the subway, ride buses, use Citi Bike and spend time ""in the streets"" with New Yorkers, rather than retreat behind the gates of the mansion.“I may be changing where I rest my head at the end of every evening,” he said, “but I will not be changing anything about how I interact with the incredible New Yorkers who call this city home.”For one, the house is rumoured to be haunted. However, Mamdani said he hasn't met the ghosts yet. “I haven’t yet met the ghost or heard from the ghost,” he quipped.Apart from that, he and his illustrator wife Rama Duwaji are now privy to five bedrooms on the upper floor of the house that they can redecorate as they please. Downstairs, there is a formal ballroom and dining room along with an in-house chef.The 227-year-old mansion is surrounded by a sprawling lawn with views of the East River and a veranda too.Before their move, Mamdani and his wife lived in Astoria, which is separated from Gracie only by a bend of the East River. The couple who tied the knot in 2025, lived in a rent-stabilised apartment since 2019 while paying $2,300 a month.Considering his campaigning on affordable housing in NYC, moving into a mansion was actually prompted by a desire for security. “This decision came down to our family’s safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,” said the mayor in a statement last month.","New York mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife Rama Duwaji have officially moved into the Gracie Mansion, the official mayor's residence in Manhattan.

Authorities have identified Stephen Spencer Pittman as the man accused of setting fire to a historic synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi.19-year-old Pittman from Madison, Mississippi, was charged on Monday with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.The fire broke out shortly after 3 am on Saturday at the Beth Israel Congregation, the largest and only synagogue in Mississippi’s capital. No congregants or firefighters were injured, but the blaze heavily damaged the building’s library and administrative offices, and several scrolls were destroyed or damaged.According to an FBI affidavit filed in US District Court in Mississippi, Pittman admitted to setting the fire because of the synagogue’s “Jewish ties.” During questioning, he referred to the building as the “synagogue of Satan,” law enforcement said.Security camera footage released by the synagogue showed a masked and hooded person using a gas can to pour liquid on the floor and a couch in the lobby before the blaze started. Pittman told investigators he had stopped at a gas station on the way and purchased the gasoline used in the fire. He also removed his vehicle’s licence plate.The suspect’s father alerted authorities after receiving a message from his son, and a burned cell phone believed to belong to Pittman was recovered by the FBI. A hand torch found at the scene was also turned over to investigators.Beth Israel Congregation was founded in 1860 and steeped in civil rights history. It was previously bombed by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a white supremacist group, in 1967. Community leaders condemned the latest attack, and the synagogue’s president pledged to rebuild with support from local churches.Mayor John Horhn of Jackson called the arson a threat to community safety and religious freedom. The suspect was treated for non‑life‑threatening burns and, once medically cleared, is expected to face further legal proceedings.","Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, charged with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.

Cuba's president says no current talks with the US following Trump's threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cubas-president-says-no-current-talks-with-the-us-following-trumps-threats/articleshow/126494907.cms,".





HAVANA: Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday that his administration is not in talks with the US government, a day after President Donald Trump threatened the Caribbean island in the wake of the US attack on Venezuela.Diaz-Canel posted a flurry of brief statements on X after Trump suggested that Cuba ""make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."" He did not say what kind of deal.Diaz-Canel wrote that for ""relations between the US and Cuba to progress, they must be based on international law rather than hostility, threats, and economic coercion.""He added: ""We have always been willing to hold a serious and responsible dialogue with the various US governments, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, principles of International Law, and mutual benefit without interference in internal affairs and with full respect for our independence.""His statements were reposted by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on X.A key lifeline severed On Sunday, Trump wrote that Cuba would no longer live off oil and money from Venezuela, which the US attacked on Jan. 3 in a stunning operation that killed 32 Cuban officers and led to the arrest of President Nicolas Maduro.Cuba was receiving an estimated 35,000 barrels a day from Venezuela before the US attacked, along with some 5,500 barrels daily from Mexico and roughly 7,500 from Russia, according to Jorge Pinon of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, who tracks the shipments.On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum once again declined to provide data on current oil shipments or say whether such shipments would increase when Venezuelan supplies end. She insisted that the aid ""has been ongoing for a long time; it's not new.""Sheinbaum said Mexico's fuel supply to Cuba is not a concern for her country because ""there is enough oil"" - even though production of state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos is steadily declining. She reiterated that her government is willing to facilitate dialogue between the US and Cuba if both agree.Even with oil shipments from Venezuela, widespread blackouts have persisted across Cuba given fuel shortages and a crumbling electric grid. Experts worry a lack of petroleum would only deepen the island's multiple crises that stem from an economic paralysis during the Covid-19 pandemic and a radical increase in US sanctions following the first Trump administration, which aim to force a change in Cuba's political model.The communist government has said US sanctions cost the country more than $7.5 billion between March 2024 and February 2025, a staggering sum for an island whose tourism revenue reached some $3 billion annually at its peak in the previous decade.The crisis also has triggered a large wave of migration primarily to the United States, where Cubans enjoyed immigration privileges as exiles. Those privileges were curtailed before Trump closed US borders.'They didn't even bring Cuban coffee' The situation between the US and Cuba is ""very sad and concerning,"" said Andy S. Gomez, retired dean of the School of International Studies and senior fellow in Cuban Studies at the University of Miami.He said he sees Diaz-Canel's latest comments ""as a way to try and buy a little bit of time for the inner circle to decide what steps it's going to take.""Gomez said he doesn't visualize Cuba reaching out to US officials right now.""They had every opportunity when President (Barack) Obama opened up US diplomatic relations, and yet they didn't even bring Cuban coffee to the table,"" Gomez said. ""Of course, these are desperate times for Cuba.""Michael Galant, senior research and outreach associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C., said he believes Cuba might be willing to negotiate.""Cuba has been interested in finding ways to ease sanctions,"" he said. ""It's not that Cuba is uncooperative.""Galant said topics for discussion could include migration and security, adding that he believes Trump is not in a hurry.""Trump is hoping to deepen the economic crisis on the island, and there are few costs to Trump to try and wait that out,"" he said. ""I don't think it's likely that there will be any dramatic action in the coming days because there is no rush to come to the table.""Cuba's president stressed on X that ""there are no talks with the US government, except for technical contacts in the area of migration.""As tensions remained heightened, life went on as usual for many Cubans, although some were more concerned than others.Oreidy Guzman, a 32- year-old food delivery person, said he doesn't want anything bad to happen to Cubans, ""but if something has to happen, the people deserve change.""Meanwhile, 37-year-old homemaker Meilyn Gomez said that while she doesn't believe the US would invade Cuba, she was preparing for any possible outcome under Trump: ""He'll find entertainment anywhere.""The current situation is dominating chatter among Cubans on the island and beyond.""Cuban people talk and talk,"" said 57-year-old bartender Ruben Benitez, ""but to be honest, eleven, eight or nine million will take to the streets to defend what little we have left.""","President Miguel Diaz-Canel says his administration is not in talks with the US government.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Declares Himself ‘Acting President’ Of Venezuela, Spills The Beans On $50M Oil Deal With Delcy

Rubio to coordinate Caracas governance with interim president





Donald Trump posted on Truth Social a fake Wikipedia profile calling him ""acting president"" of Venezuela, seemingly mocking the besieged country, United Nations, and the global community.While the charitable explanation from some analysts is that he is trolling Venezuela and the world, concern and outrage rippled through many who said he is emboldened by the silence and tacit concurrence of most countries to the US takeover of a sovereign nation. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice-president to abducted president Nicolas Maduro, is currently acting president of Venezuela.Trump had detailed secretary of state Marco Rubio —now dubbed “Viceroy” of Venezuela — to coordinate its governance with Delcy Rodriguez, the US-designated interim Venezuelan president who was deposed President Nicolas Maduro’s deputy. Trump had openly threatened Rodriguez, saying if she doesn’t give US corporations “total access” to “the oil and other things”, she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro”.It is unclear if Rodriguez, who is currently cooperating with the US, is doing so voluntarily or at gunpoint. But Trump’s hardball is not going down well with Americans critic outside the ambit of MAGA. “A US president declaring himself president of another nation 1,000 miles from his own nation’s borders is unhinged criminality.This is done to prime the US public for wider criminality to come,” Brian Berletic, a former US Marine who writes on geopolitics, said in a post on X.While several countries, notably China, Russia, and Brazil have condemned US takeover of Venezuela, others like Argentina, Ecuador, and Israel have supported the US action. Some others, like the EU, UK, and India, have taken a “middle ground” of strategic acquiescence that falls short of outright condemnation, which, critics say, will embolden Trump administration to flex its muscles elsewhere across the world.","Donald Trump posted on Truth Social a fake Wikipedia profile calling him ""acting president"" of Venezuela.

absolutely not you are lying and you know it that is a straight violation of privacy, man or woman

But it’s standard protocol to pickup someone working at Target and then when they verify their citizenship you just dump them miles away?





A video showing an immigration agent entering a portable toilet with a handcuffed person has gone viral on social media and drawn an official response from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The video showed an agent and a detainee near a porta-potty in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. In many posts, users suggested the person being led inside was a woman and criticised the officer’s actions, with questions raised over what occurred behind the closed door, like sexual assault.In response, the DHS said the person in the footage was not a woman but a man who needed to use the restroom. The department said it does not deny people in custody the right to use a toilet. “The illegal alien in this video was a male and had to use restroom,” a DHS spokesperson said. “We don’t deny people the right to use the bathroom.”The department explained that standard policy in such situations is to never allow a subject alone in an enclosed space because someone under arrest “could barricade themselves in.” This guidance was reiterated by DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin who said the policy is longstanding and applies to all detainees.Some social media users alleged inappropriate behaviour and questioned why the agent entered the porta-potty with the detainee. Others pointed out that the video’s content is too brief to determine exactly what happened after the door was closed.The clip comes amid heightened focus on ICE tactics nationally, particularly following other controversial incidents involving federal agents in Minneapolis, where an agent fatally shot a woman last week.","The video showed an agent and a detainee near a porta-potty in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.

Trump and Leavitt's flirty relationship



Trump's history of surprising comments







American President Donald Trump is known for his fun-loving nature and peculiar humour to many. The 79-year-old Republican president does not shy away from expressing anything that comes to his mind. From veering away in speeches to reading notes out loud, he has acknowledged his own tendencies to wander in verbal speech.However, his most recent comment about White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has not made the internet double down with laughter. It has them furious over the President.While aboard Air Force One on January 11, Trump was engaged in a mid-flight press interview as he returned to Washington from his stay at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. When the plane hit unexpected turbulence, he began searching for something to hold onto and balance himself with. Then, made a remark about the only person standing behind him, Karoline Leavitt.“I’m looking for something to grab here because it’s going to get rough. I don’t seem to be in a great… I think you did this to me. You put me in a position where there is absolutely nothing to grab. So I’m looking for something to grab, and it’s not going to be Karoline,” he said on camera.As he turned back to search for something to grab, Leavitt stepped aside showing him a handle nearby to grab on.The video of the seemingly humorous exchange quickly went viral online, prompting numerous comments condemning the President's thoughtless remark and raising questions about appropriateness and tone.“What A Creep!,"" wrote an X user.""Karoline is smiling but she is scared of Trump not sure what he may do,"" pointed out another.""Always with the tasteless comments, even at a moment like that,"" condemned one.""Absolute Clownism from him,"" quipped another.Interestingly, this isn't the first time Trump has made a comment on the 28-year-old press secretary. Previously, he has made a lengthy comment about Leavitt's physical appearance and professional prowess. “She’s become a star. It’s that face. It’s that brain. It’s those lips, the way they move. They move like she’s a machine gun,” he said.The comparison of Leavitt's lips to a 'machine gun' drew immediate online criticism with many dubbing the remark inappropriate.Karoline Leavitt isn't the only woman Trump has made eye-raising comments about. During the Christmas reception at the White House, Trump paused midway and grinned at a woman in the crowd. “Boy, you look like Ivanka,” he said, referring to his 44-year-old daughter. “Has anyone ever told you that? I’m looking and saying, ‘Is that Ivanka?’”He even asked the woman to ""turn around for the camera"" asking the crowd to weigh in, “Doesn’t she look like Ivanka? It’s the most unbelievable thing,” he declared.Before that he also made a shocking comment about his wife's undergarments. Speaking at a North Carolina rally in December 2025, he went off-topic to talk about the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022. “They went into my wife's closet ... they looked at her drawers,” he said, referring to Melania. The GOP leader then said: “Her undergarments, sometimes referred to as panties, are folded perfect, wrapped. They're, like, so perfect. ” He even joked about her maintenance habits, saying, “I think that she steams them.”While some consider these remarks as expressions of Trump's humorous nature, for others they tend to cross the personal and professional boundary.","President Donald Trump made a comment about White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a mid-flight interview.

Mark Ruffalo to Jean Smart: Hollywood celebrities wear ‘Be Good’ pins to honour Renee Nicole Good at Golden Globes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mark-ruffalo-to-jean-smart-hollywood-celebrities-wear-be-good-pins-to-honour-renee-nicole-good-at-golden-globes/articleshow/126490134.cms,"



At the 83rd Golden Globe Awards on 11 January 2026, several Hollywood actors used the ceremony’s global spotlight to make a subdued political statement by wearing “Be Good” pins on the red carpet. The pins were worn in tribute to Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, poet and mother of three who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent during a raid in Minneapolis earlier this month.Among those seen wearing the pins were Mark Ruffalo Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne . The badges were visible during red carpet appearances, with Smart also wearing hers while accepting an award onstage.The phrase “Be Good” has become associated with campaigns calling for accountability in immigration enforcement following Good’s death. Supporters say the wording reflects a call for restraint and humanity rather than a confrontational slogan, allowing the message to be carried through symbolism rather than speeches.Federal authorities have described the shooting as self-defence, alleging that Good obstructed agents with her vehicle during the operation. Minneapolis officials reviewing body camera footage have disputed that account, calling the agent’s actions reckless.The incident has triggered large-scale protests across the city and beyond, alongside a fundraiser that has raised more than $1.4 million for Good’s family.The appearance of the pins at the Golden Globes quickly became one of the night’s most discussed moments. Supporters praised the actors for using a high-visibility cultural event to draw attention to an ongoing investigation and broader concerns around immigration enforcement.As the investigation into Renee Nicole Good’s killing continues, the moment at the Golden Globes highlights how major entertainment events can be used to bring national debates into the spotlight, even during ceremonies focused on celebration.","Mark Ruffalo Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne were among those seen wearing the pins.

Prior immigration denials

Amid the US administration's crackdown on visa fraud, immigration attorney Brad Bernstein spoke about seven red flags that instantly trigger a marriage fraud investigation. Marriage fraud is treated seriously in the US law as cases of people marrying only to get Green Cards are plenty. If the officials find a marriage fraud, the offender could end up in jail for up to five years.Marriage fraud involves a US citizen so that a non-citizen can get a Green Card. Rackets of taking money for such Green Card marriages, where the non-US citizen pays the US citizen for the marriage and hence it becomes a serial offence where the US citizen marries several in exchange for money.In 2025, a 29-year-old Indian national pleaded guilty to having committed the marriage fraud offence, only to stay in the US. The man, Jai Prakash Makwana, overstayed his J-1 visa and then married US citizen Kalee Ann Huff to get a Green Card. Makwana was living in West Virginia and he falsified a residential lease agreement to make it appear that he and Huff lived together. He also added Huff's name to his utility bills and bank accounts to avoid all the known pitfalls.Bernstein said the top 7 triggers for marriage frauds are:Once the USCIS is tipped off about a supposed marriage scam, possibly by ex-spouses, neighbors or employers, disgruntled family members, the USCIS goes through the documents, marriage certificate, joint lease, mortgage, insurance policies etc. The spouses are then interviewed where their body language and consistency is checked. If doubts remain, spouses are questioned separately.","Marriage fraud involves a US citizen so that a non-citizen can get a Green Card.

Activism and fears of federal targeting



Passport renewal leads to a more disturbing discovery



Broader policy backdrop







Alexis Rose, a registered nurse and pro-trans activist who goes by @travelingnurselex on social media, says she was effectively erased from the US passport system, triggering fears about how recent federal actions targeting transgender people may be playing out in real life.Rose, a trans woman with more than 376,000 followers, shared her account in a video posted on January 8, 2026, explaining that she was urged to speak publicly after what she describes as an unprecedented and deeply unsettling encounter with multiple federal systems.“I was urged to make this video by the office of my congressional representatives which is a crazy thing to say out loud,” she said. “Someone or something in the Trump administration wiped my existence from the US Passport database.”According to Rose, the first sign something was wrong came in the early hours of December 19, 2025. She said she received a notification at 2:17 a.m. local time in Los Angeles informing her that her access to the Global Entry Travel Programme had been revoked.The reason given, she said, was that she “no longer met the requirements for the Global Entry Programme.”Global Entry, run by US Customs and Border Protection, allows pre-approved, low-risk travellers expedited entry into the United States and includes automatic access to TSA PreCheck.Eligibility typically depends on factors such as criminal history, valid identification, and national security checks.Rose said none of the standard disqualifiers applied to her. “Now the requirements are not having been charged with felony. Check. Never been charged with a felony,” she said. “Having valid identification and documents. Check. My passport was not expired.”She added that another eligibility condition stood out given the timing. “And one of the last things on the eligibility list was not under investigation for terrorism.”Rose linked the revocation to her work as a trans advocate and healthcare provider. She said the same day her Global Entry access was revoked, US Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to the FBI requesting that pro-trans activists be labeled as domestic terrorists.“Well that exact day, Pam Bondi sent a letter to the FBI requesting that Pro Trans activists be labelled as domestic terrorist,” Rose said.Earlier in December, the Justice Department instructed the FBI to intensify investigations into what it describes as “domestic terrorist” organisations, a category that now includes groups promoting what the administration calls “radical gender ideology.” Bondi issued a memorandum on December 4, directing prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to act under NSPM-7, President Donald Trump’s September directive ordering investigations into domestic extremist groups.Rose said her activism is not theoretical or online-only.“So as many of you guys know, I am a pro trans activist. I have worked with ACLU during the US vs. Skrmetti case. I have a trans partner. I have a trans sister, I am blessed to have many trans friends and I have worked as a healthcare provider, providing gender affirming care for trans youth.”Initially, Rose said she was told the Global Entry issue might be a clerical mistake. On advice from attorneys and contacts in federal agencies, she applied to renew her passport online, since it is set to expire later this year.What followed, she said, was even more alarming.“I was then told that no one with my identity was found anywhere in the US passport system,” Rose said.She contacted her congressional representative’s office, where a field staffer told her the notice was highly unusual. She was informed that some people have previously been removed from the system after their passports were mistakenly marked as lost or stolen.“That is not what happened to me,” Rose said, stressing that the message she received was different and explicitly stated that no record of her identity existed in the system.Rose’s experience comes amid a rapid escalation of federal action against transgender healthcare and advocacy. In December, 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would ban all forms of trans healthcare for youth and cut public funding to hospitals that continue to provide such care. The proposed rules aim to restrict puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgical interventions for transgender children, including barring Medicaid and Medicare funding.According to the Associated Press, 27 states already have laws restricting or banning trans healthcare for youth, while only 15 states have protections in place.These regulatory changes overlap with legislation recently passed in the House, including HR 498, which seeks to ban Medicaid coverage for trans-related care.Rose says she is now waiting for an in-person appointment with the US passport agency, scheduled for Tuesday, where she hopes to finally get clarity on what happened.In a follow-up video, she said she remains unsure whether her passport could be confiscated or whether she will be able to travel freely again.She ended her initial video with a plea to her audience: “If I go dark, I need you guys to be really loud.”As of now, Rose says she has received no official explanation for why her Global Entry access was revoked or why her identity appears to have vanished from the passport system, leaving her questioning how two separate government agencies were alerted to her at the same time, and what that might mean going forward.","Alexis Rose, a registered nurse and pro-trans activist, says she was effectively erased from the US passport system.

The US State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, the highest annual total on record. The figure is more than double the roughly 40,000 revocations reported in 2024.The department said the increase follows a January 2025 executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which reinstated stricter foreign-vetting rules and expanded post-issuance checks. The revocations span several visa categories.Officials said about 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialised work visas were cancelled. These cases involved visa holders who had encounters with US law enforcement for criminal activity. The majority of overall revocations, however, involved business and tourist visas, particularly overstays.A State Department spokesperson said many student and worker visas were revoked following arrests or criminal charges. Others were cancelled after reviews under enhanced screening procedures. Among specialised workers, cited offences included driving under the influence, assault, theft, fraud and drug-related cases.The surge comes alongside the rollout of a “continuous vetting” system. Under the programme, visa holders can be reviewed even after they enter the United States. In August 2025, the department said it was reviewing the status of around 55 million foreign nationals holding valid US visas.The enforcement drive also includes renewed use of the “public charge” rule. The rule allows visas to be denied or revoked if applicants are assessed as likely to rely on public benefits. Factors considered include health, age, financial resources and English proficiency.Officials said the policy is aimed at strengthening public safety and national security. They added that reviews and revocations will continue under the current framework.The scale of the cancellations has drawn attention from universities, employers and immigration groups. They have raised concerns about due process and the impact on international students and skilled workers. Earlier student visa revocations in 2025 prompted legal challenges and calls for clearer guidance.The State Department said additional reviews are expected to continue into 2026 as the expanded vetting measures remain in place.","US State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, the highest annual total on record.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause.

Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

China to deploy military in Balochistan?

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

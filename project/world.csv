A week later

As South Korea waits for another opposition push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday, more details are emerging of what happened in the hours surrounding his declaration of martial law.The following is an account of the December 3 night when Yoon announced a decision that has plunged the nation into the biggest political turmoil in years and sent shock ripples across the world. It is based on the testimony of cabinet members, who were speaking before the country’s parliament.As the clock ticked toward 10pm, one minister after another arrived in the presidential office in Seoul, carrying little knowledge of why Yoon had summoned them. Agriculture minister Song Miryung asked a person next to her as she seated herself in the meeting room, and heard, “martial law.”Startled, she uttered, “Nonsense.”Moments later, when there were 10 ministers gathered, Yoon trudged in. His presence put the group over the threshold of 11 people necessary for a legal cabinet meeting.“I haven’t discussed this with anybody,” Yoon said in his first remark, Song recalled. She couldn’t remember anything else he said from then, because her mind “had already blacked out,” she told parliament on Wednesday.South Korea’s law requires a cabinet meeting before martial law can be declared, but the president has the discretion to act unilaterally. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok told parliament that he “strongly objected” to Yoon’s plan, contending his move would wreak havoc on the economy, including a potential downgrade of South Korea’s credit ratings.As Choi expected, the stock market plunged in the days after Yoon declared martial law, erasing tens of billions of dollars worth of value. The South Korean won at one point tumbled against the dollar to the worst level since the global financial crisis.Prime Minister Han Duck-soo testified that he joined Choi in pleading with the president to reconsider his decision, but Yoon remained stubborn, arguing the martial law was inevitable in order to safeguard the constitution.The president then stomped out of the room, just five minutes after he had come in. The meeting ended so quickly there is not even a transcript of it.The ministers stayed behind, stunned and wondering where he had gone. Moments later, Yoon’s voice started to come out of one person’s smartphone, declaring martial law in a nationally televised address. More shock followed.Worried about the impact on markets, Choi quickly arranged a meeting with top financial policymakers, including Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong. In a statement released after midnight, they pledged “unlimited liquidity” as long as necessary.During the meeting, Choi told the group he would step down, a decision that Rhee managed to dissuade him from. The economy, which was already facing difficulties ranging from slowing exports to Donald Trump’s tariff plans, couldn’t afford to lose its seasoned finance chief.Across town, special forces landed on the National Assembly compound by helicopter and scuffled with lawmakers, breaking into the parliament to prevent a majority gathering that could vote to nullify Yoon’s move.Still, some 190 lawmakers managed to sneak in, including main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who live-streamed himself jumping over the wall to get in.In a unanimous vote that included support from ruling party lawmakers, the parliament forced the cancellation of Yoon’s decree. Troops started to pull out.Yoon re-appeared on national television and said he was retracting his martial-law declaration, ending a six-hour row that now threatens to cut his single, five-year term short.Yoon reiterated his argument that the opposition was pushing to paralyze his government with a series of impeachment motions against top officials and a unilateral cut to his budget plan. He would repeat his stance eight days later, vowing to face impeachment head-on.Yoon’s defense minister during the night has since been arrested on charges of treason and attempted suicide behind bars. The rest of the cabinet faces allegations that they may have colluded with Yoon to impose martial law.The other cabinet members have denied any active role in Yoon’s decision and are seeking to defend themselves. In one hearing, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae was asked whether he’d join a legal defense team for Yoon, and sparked laughter when he replied, “I’ve got a fire in my own backyard.”Prime Minister Han said on Wednesday that he regretted not doing more to stop Yoon, even if it would’ve involved physically grabbing the president by the ankles.“Looking back now, I probably should’ve done so,” he said. “I’m so heart-broken I couldn’t stop it.”",South Korea’s law requires a cabinet meeting before martial law can be declared.

Canadian premiers urge Trudeau to take strong action against looming US tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-premiers-urge-trudeau-to-take-strong-action-against-looming-us-tariffs/articleshow/116271204.cms,"As the threat of tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump looms, Canadian premiers have urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to 'respond robustly'. Some suggested cutting off energy supplies and highlighted other products for which the US ""relies on"" Canada.Trudeau met with Canada's premiers on Wednesday to discuss Ottawa's plan to address Trump's concerns. This was the second meeting since Trump threatened to impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports after he was sworn in as President in January, CBC News reported.Canada's finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, who was at Wednesday's meeting, said some premiers are in favour of a robust response to threatened US tariffs, CBC News reported. She also took suggestions from premiers on which products to target if retaliatory tariffs become necessary.""Some premiers proactively identified products that their provinces produce and export to the United States -- and which the US relies on -- and which should be considered as part of the Canadian response,"" she said.Further, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is currently the chair of the Council of the Federation, stated that the meeting was a ""good start,"" as Canada needs to be ready to fight Trump's tariffs. ""Canada needs to be ready to fight and that Trump's tariffs are 100 per cent coming. Folks, this is coming ... it's coming January 20 or 21, and we need to be prepared. We need to stand as a country,"" he stressed.In a bold statement, Ford said that Canada could cut off energy supplies to the US as Canada sends a significant amount of oil, natural gas, and electricity south of the border. ""We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,"" he declared. ""I don't want this to happen, but my number one job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians, and Canadians as a whole,"" he added.Notably, Trump announced plans to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods last month. According to CBC News, Trump has threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods unless both countries address what he describes as an ""invasion"" of drugs, particularly fentanyl, and all ""illegal aliens"" into the US.The US imported a significant amount of goods from Canada in recent years. In 2022, the total value of these imports was USD 614.3 billion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. More recent data from the US Census Bureau shows that between January and September of this year, the US imported around USD 435 billion worth of goods from Canada.","US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports.

'We're not being told the truth': Mysterious drones in New Jersey fuel UFO theories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-evidence-to-suggest-mysterious-new-jersey-drones-work-of-foreign-adversary-white-house-pentagon-us/articleshow/116271579.cms,"Still image of unidentified object spotted in New Jersey (Image Credit: X)

A few weeks ago residents of New Jersey spotted unidentified drones in the skies, some believing it was a UFO but the authorities still have no clue.Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who along with R-N J suggested that unmanned aerial vehicles could be Iranian 'mothership,' contested this on Fox News that, ""We aren't being told the truth. They are dealing with the American public like we're stupid.""Dismissing the case of the possibility of an Iranian ""mothership"" being responsible, White House spokesperson John Kirby said that the Coast Guard has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels.In a presser, Kirby said, ""We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they’re working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources, using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.""""Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, we have not been able to — and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities — corroborate any of the reported visual sightings. To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,"" he added.He also noted that the US authorities is taking the threat seriously that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems and that is why law enforcement and other agencies continue to support New Jersey and investigate the reports, ""even though they have uncovered no malicious activity or intent at this particular stage.""Kirby urged Congress to pass important legislation that will extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities so that the authorities are better prepared to identify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh stated, ""There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.""She further noted there is ""no evidence"" suggesting foreign adversary involvement.While the Pentagon denies foreign involvement, the FBI has expressed concern about their limited knowledge. During a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director Robert Wheeler acknowledged uncertainty about potential risks.The FBI later suggested to Fox News Digital that the sightings might not be drones at all. A spokesperson explained they lack evidence of national security threats or foreign connections, noting that many reported sightings appear to be lawful manned aircraft.The drones have been observed near sensitive locations, including a military research facility. Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, highlighted outdated detection systems as a potential issue in tracking these objects.The sightings began on November 18, with nightly observations continuing until about 11 p.m. Reports vary from four to 180 sightings per night. According to state Rep. Dawn Fantasia, the objects are ""six feet in diameter"" and operate in coordination with lights off.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy maintains there is no public safety threat. However, similar incidents have occurred previously, including drone sightings near Langley Air Force Base last year and the Chinese spy balloon incident.Pramod Abichandani, an NJIT drone expert, noted these operations violate numerous FAA regulations. The situation remains unresolved, with some officials, including Fantasia, calling for military intervention.","Residents of New Jersey spotted unidentified drones in the skies, some believing it was a UFO but the authorities still have no clue.

Police say a severe back injury may have motivated a man to kill the health insurance firm UnitedHealthcare CEO in New York City . Luigi Mangione , 26, is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week. Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday after a nationwide search.NYPD chief of detectives Joseph Kenny confirmed to NBC New York that the suspect experienced a significant medical incident in July 2023. ""He posted X-rays of screws being inserted into his spine. So the injury that he suffered was, was a life-changing, life-altering injury, and that's what may have put him on this path,"" Kenny said.Police say they haven't found any evidence that Mangione was a UnitedHealthcare customer. They suggest he might have targeted the company because it is the largest health insurer in the US. Fingerprints and shell casings link Mangione to the crime scene, according to police. Investigators have not yet accessed Mangione’s phone or spoken to his family.At the time of his arrest, Mangione had a handwritten note criticizing the US healthcare system and a notebook with apparent plans for the murder. One entry reportedly saidd, “What do you do? You wack the CEO at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention. It’s targeted, precise, and doesn’t risk innocents.”Currently detained in Pennsylvania, Mangione is contesting extradition to New York. Manhattan prosecutors have begun grand jury proceedings, which could strengthen their extradition case, ABC News reported.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.

US Planning to bring Timmerman back



A US man, detained for months in a Syrian prison after entering the country, has finally become a free bird as rebels overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad.On Thursday, a man identifying himself as Travis Timmerman was found in Syria following his release from imprisonment. In a conversation with CBS News, Timmerman explained his attempts to exit the country after his prison release. He disclosed that his detention occurred seven months prior when he entered Syria without authorisation after spending a month in Lebanon.""My door was busted down, it woke me up,"" Timmerman recounted of his Monday release by two armed men. ""I thought the guards were still there, so I thought the warfare could have been more active than it ended up being… Once we got out, there was no resistance, there was no real fighting.""Timmerman revealed his religious motivations for visiting Syria and described his imprisonment as relatively tolerable. He noted that whilst he avoided physical abuse, bathroom access was restricted to thrice daily.Following his release, Timmerman departed with others and began walking, aiming towards Jordan. He acknowledged experiencing brief moments of anxiety upon leaving prison, though he hadn't fully processed his freedom, focusing instead on securing nightly accommodation.He expressed feeling comfortable seeking assistance from locals, who often approached him first. Timmerman mentioned previous communication with his family three weeks ago using a permitted mobile phone whilst in prison. ""I'm feeling well. I've been fed and I've been watered, so I'm feeling well,"" he stated.Hungarian police records from August identified him as ""Travis Pete Timmerman"" in a missing person's notice, last spotted at a local church. The Missouri State Highway Patrol's bulletin listed him as Pete Timmerman, aged 29, last seen in Budapest, with final contact dated June 2, 2024.US state secretary Antony Blinken said that they are working to bring home Timmerman found. He made this statement in Jordan, where he held meetings to discuss the political transition in Syria.""In terms of (the) American citizen who was found just today, I can't give you any details on exactly what's going to happen, except to say that we're working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria,"" Blinken told reporters in Aqaba.""But for privacy reasons, I can't share any more details about this,"" Blinken added.The US had no prior indication the man was in Syria, White House spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing. ""We are just getting word of this, and we're trying to confirm his identity at this point, so the state department is working hard on that right now.""","Travis Timmerman, 29, was found in the Syrian desert on Thursday.

GLOSTRUP: British hedge fund trader Sanjay Shah was sentenced by a Danish court to 12 years in prison after being found guilty on Thursday of defrauding the state to the tune of $1.3 billion in a 'cum-ex' tax case.The sentence, one of the longest for tax fraud in Danish history, comes after a high-profile trial over trading schemes that drained billions of dollars from the public treasuries of several European countries after the 2008 financial crisis.The city court found that Shah, 54, masterminded a scheme that fraudulently secured 9 billion Danish crowns ($1.2 billion) in dividend tax refunds from Danish treasury between 2012 and 2015.Shah, who appeared in court wearing a red Christmas hat, has denied any wrongdoing and argued that he used a legal loophole. He immediately appealed the verdict to the Danish HC. Prosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of 12 years in prison. Before the verdict, Shah called himself ""a greedy b*****d"" and said his trading scheme had been ""like playing Space Invaders,"" where he wanted to beat his previous high score.During the trial, which began in May after an almost 10-year investigation, the prosecution showed that dummy companies controlled by Shah pretended to own shares in Danish companies and received tax rebates for which they were not eligible. Prosecutors said they had identified more than 3,000 such requests.Shah faces a separate £1.4 billion ($1.8 billion) civil tax fraud case in London, filed by Danish tax authority, that is due to end in April. agencies","The sentence is one of the longest for tax fraud in Danish history.

Mark Zuckerberg has private meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund.The donation follows a recent meeting between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Trump at Mar-a-Lago. During that meeting last month, the two men exchanged pleasantries and Zuckerberg congratulated Trump on winning the presidency.Stephen Miller, who is set to become Trump’s deputy chief of staff in his second term, said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, supports Trump’s economic plans, news agency AP reported. Zuckerberg has been working to improve his company’s image among conservatives after past tensions with Trump.Inauguration funds cover the costs of events and activities associated with a new president taking office. Some view these contributions as efforts to gain favour with the incoming administration.Trump was removed from Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack but was reinstated in early 2023. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate but expressed more favorable views of Trump. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg praised Trump’s response to the July 13 assassination attempt as ""one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life"".Despite this, Trump continued to criticize Zuckerberg during his campaign. In July, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying, “Zuckerbucks, be careful!” while threatening to take action against election fraud.Corporate donations are a common source of funding for presidential inaugurations, except in 2009 when then-President-elect Barack Obama declined corporate contributions. He later accepted such donations for his second inauguration in 2013.Facebook had not donated to either Biden’s 2021 inauguration or Trump’s 2017 inauguration. In contrast, Google contributed $285,000 to both events, according to Federal Election Commission records. Microsoft donated $1 million to Obama’s 2013 inauguration but gave $500,000 each to Trump’s 2017 event and Biden’s 2021 event. Inaugural committees must disclose their fundraising sources but are not required to detail spending."," Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

'Surgery was painful': UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione's social media posts indicate about his health struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgery-was-painful-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-social-media-posts-indicate-about-his-health-struggles/articleshow/116270935.cms,"Social media posts of Luigi Mangione , who was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, give an insight into his physical and mental health issues.Last year, following his spinal surgery for chronic back pain , he became an advocate for the procedure that positively transformed his life. He actively encouraged individuals facing similar conditions, to challenge medical professionals who suggested pain was inevitable.His Reddit posts discuss spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where vertebral fractures cause misalignment. This can lead to severe pain when nerves are compressed.According to his social media posts, this condition, which can develop during childhood or through injury, began significantly affecting Mangione's life in recent years.Following his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees, he was employed at TrueCar, a Santa Monica-based car-buying website until 2023. He resided in Hawaii beginning January 2022. His back condition deteriorated, partly due to a surfing incident during his six-month residence at Surfbreak, a ""co-living"" accommodation in Honolulu.According to Josiah Ryan, who speaks for Surfbreak's owner and founder R.J. Martin, Mangione increasingly voiced concerns about his pain. The condition affected his ability to participate in recreational activities and exercise, and he worried about its impact on potential romantic relationships.""That was definitely a theme in his time there,"" Ryan said. ""He wasn't a big complainer. So it wasn't like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.""In July 2023, Mangione shared on Reddit his decision to undergo surgery.""I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,"" he wrote.His posts indicated the procedure was successful. His X account displayed what seemed to be an X-ray showing a metal rod and multiple screws inserted in his lower spine.""Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,"" Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. ""Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.""In a post from July 2018, he discussed his academic challenges and thoughts of leaving university. However, he noted that ""staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality.""His final Reddit contribution was on May 17, with surrounding posts indicating stability and no apparent health complications. He appeared supportive of the surgical procedure he had undergone previously.In early April, he shared details about equipment chosen for an extended Asian backpacking adventure involving motorcycle travel, describing it as having ""the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.""Later that month, he offered advice to another Reddit user experiencing back issues, suggesting persistent consultation with different surgeons and emphasising work inability if needed.""We live in a capitalist society,"" he wrote. ""I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.""However, his Reddit posts, did not contain direct criticism of health insurance industry profits. These sentiments apparently emerged later, as evidenced by a handwritten note discovered after his arrest for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The note mentions ""parasites"" within the healthcare system and criticises health insurers' influence and earnings, According to law enforcement officials. Upon his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione was heard shouting about an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" while being escorted into court by sheriff's deputies.Meanwhile, a senior New York City police official confirmed on Thursday to NBC New York that there was no evidence of Mangione ever having UnitedHealthcare insurance.Although the incident has led to questions about potential negative healthcare experiences, Mangione's 2023 post-surgery Reddit activity showed satisfaction with his treatment and relief from chronic pain. He advised others not to fear surgical complications and mentioned travelling to Asia for backpacking this year.Interestingly, the 26-year-old Ivy League alumnus appears to have ceased social media activity approximately six months ago, coinciding with his loss of contact with family and friends.Whilst his arrest has shocked his close circle, limited information exists about his recent physical and psychological wellbeing.Meanwhile, healthcare professionals acknowledge the complexities of treating back pain.""In the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,"" said Dr Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Centre at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. He said that doctors typically explore conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before considering surgery.Despite having health insurance, patients may face substantial surgical costs depending on deductibles and other variables, although Mangione's financial situation remains unclear.Dr Padma Gulur, a pain specialist at Duke Health, highlights that chronic back pain can substantially affect mental wellbeing.“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering. But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression,” said Gulur.Additionally, details about Mangione's recent mental health remain unclear, though evidence suggests he was becoming increasingly isolated.According to police reports, his family filed a missing person report in San Francisco during November.During his university years, Mangione had documented his struggles with cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances on Reddit.",Luigi Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

The Biden administration on Thursday announced a national strategy to combat Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans . The plan outlines over 100 actions across federal agencies and society.This strategy follows a similar plan to address antisemitism released earlier this year. It arrives five weeks before President Biden leaves office and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated.The White House stated the plan’s importance has grown due to increased threats, citing the October 2023 killing of Wadee Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old Muslim boy, in Illinois.The plan focuses on four areas: Raising awareness of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate and recognising these communities’ contributions; improving their safety and security; accommodating their religious practices and reducing discrimination; and building cross-community solidarity against hate.The strategy emphasises the need to recognise that both Muslims and Arabs are targeted for their identities. It highlights new data collection and education efforts to increase awareness of this hate. The plan also calls for wider sharing of effective hate crime reporting practices and clarifies that discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans in federally funded activities is illegal. It also urges state, local, and international partners, as well as non-governmental groups, to adopt similar initiatives.The Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the plan, stating: “The White House strategy lays out some positive recommendations related to anti-Muslim bigotry, but it has been released too late to make an impact, fails to promise any changes to federal programs that perpetuate anti-Muslim discrimination on a massive scale.”They added that the plan doesn’t address what they termed a “federal watchlist” or the “US-backed genocide in Gaza.”",The Biden administration announced a national strategy to combat Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans.

During his tenure, Alsheikh allegedly directed and participated in inflicting severe physical and psychological trauma on prisoners. He reportedly ordered certain inmates to the ""Punishment Wing,"" where they endured brutal beatings whilst suspended from the ceiling and were subjected to the ""Flying Carpet"" device, which caused severe spinal injuries.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri stated: ""Samir Alsheikh is charged with torturing political dissidents and other prisoners to deter opposition to the regime of then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.""She added: ""Alsheikh later allegedly lied about his crimes to obtain a US green card. The victims of such violent treatment continue to suffer long after the physical acts of torture have ceased.

This marks a significant change from Meta's previous position, having banned Trump from its platforms after the January 6, 2021, insurrection.Previously, Trump had criticised Bezos regarding The Washington Post ownership and its coverage. In 2015, Trump tweeted: ""If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag.

The suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Luigi Mangione was not affiliated with the healthcare provider and possibly selected Brian Thompson due to size and influence, according to a senior police official on Thursday.In a discussion with NBC New York on Thursday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny revealed that evidence suggests Luigi Mangione was aware of UnitedHealthcare's annual investor conference taking place in New York City.A note discovered on Mangione during his arrest in Pennsylvania contained references to the healthcare organisation, as per AP news agency.""We have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest healthcare organization in America.

His legal representative, Thomas Dickey, states that Mangione will plead not guilty and notes the absence of conclusive evidence linking his client to the offence.The arrest occurred five days after Thompson's videotaped shooting outside a Manhattan hotel.According to police, the assailant waited near the hotel hosting the insurer's conference on the morning of December 4. He shot Thompson from behind before escaping by bicycle through Central Park.Mangione is resisting extradition to New York where he faces murder charges for Thompson's death. A hearing is set for December 30.The 26-year-old suspect, found with a ""ghost gun"" matching evidence from the crime scene, faces Pennsylvania charges including unlicensed firearm possession, forgery and providing false identification.An Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland property family, Mangione documented his experiences with severe back pain on social media before undergoing spinal fusion surgery in 2023. He later shared positive updates about reduced pain and improved mobility, encouraging others to consider similar treatment.Police indicated on Wednesday that they are investigating his writings about health issues and criticisms of corporate America and the healthcare system.Kenny revealed in the NBC interview that Mangione's family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November.","Luigi Mangione was not a client of United Healthcare, according to police.

They’ve got record profits, and I’d rather these foreign companies spend it on the great men and women on our docks, than machinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be replaced,"" Trump said.He further stated, "" In the end, there’s no gain for them, and I hope that they will understand how important an issue this is for me. For the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries. It is time to put AMERICA FIRST!""USMX responded with a statement: ""It's clear President-elect Trump, USMX, and the ILA all share the goal of protecting and adding good-paying American jobs at our ports.""The employers emphasised the necessity of modern technology for worker safety, port efficiency, capacity enhancement and supply chain strengthening, noting that increased port activity results in higher earnings for dockworkers.","US President-elect Donald Trump is backing the 45,000 union dockworkers from the East and Gulf Coasts who are in a labour dispute regarding automation. The negotiations between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance ( USMX ) employer group must conclude by January 15. The talks have reached a deadlock over automation implementation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116269609,imgsize-31132,width-400,resizemode-4/116269609.jpg"

Judge Pauline Newman , the oldest federal judge in America at 97, is challenging her suspension from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as per Fox News.Newman, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, was temporarily removed from the bench in September 2023 due to concerns about her mental fitness . A panel of judges found her mentally unfit after she reportedly refused to cooperate with an investigation, citing ""significant mental deterioration,"" including memory loss, confusion, and paranoia.Newman, however, denies these claims, asserting she is mentally and physically fit to continue serving. Her legal team has argued that the delay in her written opinions was due to her meticulous approach, ensuring they fully reflected her views.She has also filed a motion to unseal the investigation documents, claiming that her colleagues have threatened her and her legal team with unspecified sanctions for attempting to make the information public.Newman is being represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a nonprofit civil rights group that believes her suspension was unconstitutional.They have highlighted independent medical evaluations, including one by renowned neurosurgeon Dr Aaron G Filler, which found no cognitive deficits. The NCLA has argued that Newman's suspension is unprecedented in American judicial history, asserting that she was removed without due process .Newman's case is currently on appeal, with her team urging the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to stop what they describe as unconstitutional actions by the Federal Circuit Judicial Council.","Judge Pauline Newman, 97, is challenging her suspension from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Peace in the Middle East: A tall order?

Time

President-elect Donald Trump has outlined his ambitious vision to broker peace between Israel and Hamas during his upcoming term, pledging to halt the conflict in the Gaza Strip. However, he has emphasised his distrust in anyone else's ability to achieve this—not even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“I don’t trust anybody,” Trump said in amagazine interview after being named “Person of the Year.” His blunt statement reflects his cautious approach toward the Israeli leader and the broader Middle Eastern crisis.When questioned about the possibility of a two-state solution or Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, Trump maintained his focus on ending the bloodshed. “What I want is a deal where there’s going to be peace and where the killing stops,” he remarked.Trump had previously blocked Netanyahu from annexing the West Bank during his first term but left the door open for a different approach, citing the horrific attacks of 7 October 2023, which left over 1,000 people dead. “October 7 was a very terrible day,” he said, underscoring the need for long-lasting peace.Trump’s appointment of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as the incoming US ambassador to Israel has raised eyebrows. Huckabee, known for his support of Israeli settlements and openness to annexation, recently told Israel’s Army Radio he would follow the president’s policies regarding such contentious issues.Huckabee also hinted at possible US support for Israeli settlements in Gaza but refrained from making definitive statements, noting, “I don’t want to make any comments about policy because those won’t be mine to make.”Trump expressed confidence in resolving the Israel-Hamas war, claiming it to be a more manageable challenge than the Russia-Ukraine conflict. “The Middle East is going to get solved,” he told, highlighting ongoing productive developments. However, he acknowledged the complexities of creating a peace deal that satisfies all parties involved.Reflecting on his previous term, Trump cited the Abraham Accords as a missed opportunity for broader Middle Eastern cooperation and criticised the lack of subsequent progress.Emphasising his commitment to peace, Trump reiterated his goal of preventing another tragedy like the October 7 massacre. “I want a long-lasting peace, a peace where we don’t have an October 7 in another three years,” he said.","US President-elect Donald Trump has outlined his ambitious vision to broker peace between Israel and Hamas.

FBI did not send undercover agents to join January 6 Capitol attack: Watchdog report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-did-not-send-undercover-agents-to-join-january-6-capitol-attack-watchdog-report/articleshow/116265796.cms,"File photo: FBI director Christopher Wray (Picture credit: AP)

Conspiracy theories and political fallout

The US department of justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has released a report discrediting claims that the FBI actively participated in or provoked the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.As per the news agency Reuters, the findings highlight that no undercover FBI agents were present, and none of the bureau's informants were authorised to enter the Capitol or engage in violent acts during the riot.The report counters far-right conspiracy theories suggesting FBI involvement, which have been promoted by supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Notably, James Ray Epps, an Arizona man charged with a misdemeanor for entering a restricted area, was falsely accused of being an FBI informant.According to the report, 26 FBI informants were in Washington, D.C., on January 6, most attending protests on their own initiative. Of these, four entered restricted areas, with one entering the Capitol itself, but none acted on FBI instructions.Many informants provided information ahead of the event, though the intelligence was not significantly different from other sources available to the FBI.As per AP, the watchdog noted that the FBI failed to canvass all its field offices for intelligence—a basic step that could have enhanced preparations. Horowitz criticised the bureau's oversight, especially considering the available warnings about potential violence, including a bulletin from the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, field office a day prior.In response, FBI Director Chris Wray, who plans to step down at the end of President Biden’s term, defended the bureau's actions. He highlighted efforts to disseminate intelligence, including sharing the Norfolk bulletin with Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies.However, gaps remain evident, such as the FBI's failure to notify Virginia police about reports of a ""quick reaction force"" planning to station weapons nearby.The report also addresses baseless accusations by Republican lawmakers and right-wing figures claiming FBI agents disguised as Trump supporters instigated the violence.FBI Director Wray previously dismissed these allegations as ""ludicrous."" The findings underscore that while the FBI had informants on the ground, their actions were not directed by the bureau.","The US department of justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has released a report discrediting claims that the FBI actively participated in or provoked the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

James Kennedy, a former star of Bravo's Vanderpump Rules, was arrested on Tuesday night in Burbank, California, on charges of misdemeanour domestic violence, reported TMZ.The incident occurred at a private residence where Kennedy and an unnamed woman were reportedly involved in an argument.The Burbank Police Department confirmed that officers were dispatched to the residence at approximately 11.30 pm (local time) after receiving a call about the altercation. A witness allegedly saw Kennedy getting physical with the woman, though law enforcement noted no visible injuries.After investigating, the authorities deemed the incident domestic in nature and arrested Kennedy.The DJ was booked and later released on $20,000 bail. The Burbank City Attorney’s Office is currently reviewing the case for possible charges, as per police sources quoted by TMZ.It is not yet clear who the unnamed woman was but Kennedy and his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, had attended Kathy Hilton’s holiday party earlier that evening.According to a source cited by People, the couple appeared distant throughout the event, and Kennedy reportedly exhibited erratic behaviour. Witnesses at the party claimed he seemed inebriated, acted aggressively, and was ""running back and forth to the bar.""Lewber was seen alone at a public event the following day, smiling for cameras and participating in activities, such as getting a temporary tattoo, hinting at her apparent composure after the incident.Kristen Doute, Kennedy’s former girlfriend and Vanderpump Rules co-star, responded to the news by sharing a screenshot of the TMZ article on her Instagram Stories, captioning it “Finally.”Doute has previously implied abusive behaviour from Kennedy in her 2020 book, ‘He’s Making You Crazy’, though she did not explicitly name him.Kennedy, known for his turbulent personal life and struggles with alcohol, documented his sobriety journey on ‘Vanderpump Rules’. In 2021, he celebrated two years of sobriety but later revealed he was “California sober,” consuming marijuana while abstaining from alcohol.Kennedy’s arrest comes at a time of transition for Vanderpump Rules, which recently announced a complete cast reboot for its upcoming 12th season.While Kennedy is no longer part of the series, his association with the show and its controversies, such as the ""Scandoval"" cheating scandal, has kept him in the public eye.","James Kennedy, a former star of Bravo's Vanderpump Rules, was arrested on Tuesday night in Burbank, California, on charges of misdemeanour domestic violence.

US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday shared his views on childhood vaccinations while discussing his nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, signalling potential changes in vaccination policies.In an interview published by Time on Thursday, Trump revealed plans to have a ""big discussion"" with Kennedy about potentially ending childhood vaccination programs. The remarks come as Trump continues to voice concerns about the rising rates of autism, suggesting that something might be causing this increase.“I want to see the numbers,” Trump said. “At the end of the studies that we're doing, and we're going all out, we're going to know what's good and what's not good,” he continued. While Trump acknowledged that some vaccines are beneficial, he did not rule out changes to the current vaccination policies if he believes them to be unsafe or unhelpful. He also noted that such discussions would not be ""very controversial in the end.""Kennedy, who has a long-standing history of raising doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, is known for his opposition to COVID-19 restrictions and his controversial stance on the vaccine-autism link.According to Reuters, Kennedy has claimed a connection between vaccines and autism in past years, despite the scientific consensus rejecting this idea. A 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which originally linked vaccines to autism, was retracted, and subsequent research has found no such association.Autism advocacy group Autism Speaks and numerous experts have strongly opposed the notion that vaccines cause autism. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has warned that reducing vaccination rates could lead to serious outbreaks of diseases like measles, which could result in preventable deaths.“For every 1,000 cases of measles that occur in children, there will be one death,” Gottlieb told CNBC last month, emphasising the risks of decreased vaccination coverage.Trump has also suggested the need for further study on the risks of certain vaccines, pointing out that while some are crucial, others may require closer scrutiny. These statements align with his past comments during the 2016 presidential campaign, where he proposed spacing out vaccinations, echoing the debunked autism vaccine theory.If Kennedy is confirmed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, he would oversee agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which plays a key role in vaccine recommendations and policies.As per Reuters, Kennedy has expressed that he doesn’t oppose all vaccinations but may disagree with certain mandates.","US President-elect Donald Trump shared his views on childhood vaccinations while discussing his nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Kennedy has a long-standing history of raising doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

Barron Trump, the youngest son of Donald and Melania Trump, has been making waves at New York University’s Stern School of Business since starting his studies in September.The 18-year-old has reportedly captured attention on campus, earning a reputation as a ""ladies’ man"" thanks to his tall and handsome appearance. “He’s really popular with the ladies,” a source told People, adding, “Even liberal people like him.”Barron’s college journey has been unique due to his background.Upon his arrival on campus, he was accompanied by Secret Service agents, ensuring his safety while attending classes. The move to NYU marked a significant milestone for the former first son, who graduated from Florida's Oxbridge Academy in May. Donald Trump had teased earlier about his son's college choice, describing it as a ""good"" New York-based school, which was later confirmed as NYU.Melania Trump has expressed pride in Barron’s decision to study business in New York, saying it was entirely his choice. “He wants to be in New York, study here, and live at home,” she told Fox News. Melania also reflected on her parenting approach, emphasising that she raised Barron to be independent, allowing him to make his own decisions.Barron’s role during the 2024 presidential election further highlighted his maturity and political awareness. Though he declined to serve as a delegate for Florida at the Republican National Convention, citing prior commitments, he played an influential role behind the scenes.According to Melania, he provided key advice to his father and connected with his generation, significantly impacting Donald Trump’s campaign.Balancing college life and the spotlight hasn’t been easy for Barron. Melania noted, “I don’t think it’s possible for him to have a normal college experience,” but praised his resilience.","Barron Trump, the youngest son of Donald and Melania Trump, has been making waves at New York University’s Stern School of Business since starting his studies in September.

'It's crazy': Trump slams Ukraine's use of US missiles for strikes deep into Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-crazy-trump-slams-ukraines-use-of-us-missiles-for-strikes-deep-into-russia/articleshow/116264986.cms,"File photo: US President-elect Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his strong opposition to Ukraine's use of US-supplied long-range missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory.Speaking to Time magazine in an interview marking his designation as ""Person of the Year,"" Trump called the practice ""crazy,"" suggesting it worsens the ongoing war.""It's crazy what's taking place. It's crazy. I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We're just escalating this war and making it worse,"" he said.These comments follow President Joe Biden's recent decision to lift a US ban on Ukraine deploying long-range missiles like the ATACMS. This move, which Kyiv had been advocating for, was reportedly in response to Russia deploying 15,000 North Korean troops along the battlefront, according to Reuters.While Trump criticised the missile strikes, he assured that he would not abandon Ukraine. ""I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,"" he emphasised.Trump has repeatedly mentioned his intention to end the nearly three-year-old conflict swiftly but has been vague on specifics, saying his ""very good plan"" would lose value if revealed prematurely.As reported by AFP, Trump reiterated that Washington’s support for Ukraine remains crucial and could serve as leverage to negotiate an end to the war. However, his stance has sparked concerns in Kyiv, where officials worry about the potential terms of any peace deal.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently met Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where he stressed Ukraine's need for robust security guarantees. Zelensky also highlighted the staggering human toll on both sides, aligning with Trump’s comments on the urgent need to halt the bloodshed.The war continues to escalate, with Russia recently deploying its Oreshnik hypersonic missile as a retaliatory measure to Ukraine's strikes on Russian territory. Meanwhile, the US announced a $988 million arms package for Ukraine last Saturday, further solidifying its support.Asked whether he had contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin since the election, Trump declined to comment, calling it ""inappropriate.""

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges. He was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116191377,imgsize-412913,width-400,resizemode-4/116191377.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt. Arrest warrants were also issued for 45 absconding accused, with the court warning that legal proceedings would begin to declare them fugitives if they failed to appear.Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing at a makeshift court set up in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Khan has been incarcerated. Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

Sheikha Mahra of Dubai has stepped into the spotlight not just as a royal or entrepreneur, but as a figure of significant financial standing. With deep roots in the ruling Al Maktoum family and an expanding personal brand, she commands an impressive net worth, one that reflects both inheritance and initiative.Sheikha Mahra is the daughter of Dubai’s ruler and a well-known figure in Emirati high society. While her family’s collective wealth is estimated to be between $18 to $20 billion, Mahra's individual net worth is considerable in its own right.Estimates of her personal wealth range from $300 million to as high as $1.5 billion. This fortune is built on a mix of family inheritance and her own ventures. A more conservative valuation places her net worth at around $300 million, though some reports go slightly lower or higher depending on how assets are calculated.She is known to have access to a luxury lifestyle, which includes a collection of high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, and Ferrari. There are also speculative figures suggesting her monthly income is in the range of $5 million, though these are unofficial.After going through a highly publicized divorce, Sheikha Mahra entered the business world with a striking debut, launching her own luxury perfume label under the brand “Mahra M1.”Her first product, a fragrance titled “Divorce,” was priced at $272 per bottle and attracted instant attention both for its name and for the timing of its release. It wasn’t just a business venture, it was a personal statement. Bold and symbolic, the launch helped redefine her public image and introduced Mahra as a serious entrepreneur.The Mahra M1 brand quickly positioned itself as more than a one-time headline. It marked the beginning of a long-term business vision focused on high-end, statement-driven luxury products. M1 is now recognized as a growing personal enterprise and a direct contributor to her increasing net worth.This move into entrepreneurship not only broadened her financial portfolio but also showcased her intent to move beyond her royal lineage and establish financial independence through calculated branding and business acumen.Born in 1994, she pursued her education abroad, completing a degree in International Relations in London, and later enrolled at a government administration college in Dubai.In 2023, she married Sheikh Mana bin Mohammed bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum. The couple welcomed a daughter in May 2024. However, by July 2024, Mahra publicly announced their divorce in a candid social media post, invoking the Islamic triple talaq. The directness of the announcement drew wide attention, as it was rare for a royal to handle such personal matters so publicly.Following the divorce, she turned her focus to building her personal brand and business, launching Mahra M1 and becoming increasingly visible at social events and business circles across Dubai and internationally.In 2025, she was frequently seen at global events alongside American rapper French Montana. The relationship became public, and during Paris Fashion Week in June 2025, the couple confirmed their engagement. They were later seen together at various iconic Paris locations and industry functions, drawing significant media attention.Despite being born into immense privilege, Sheikha Mahra has crafted a public identity that moves beyond her royal title. Her net worth—independently estimated between $300 million and $1.5 billion, underscores her evolving role as not just a royal, but a business-minded individual shaping her own narrative.Her story is marked by strategic pivots, transforming personal chapters into professional moves. The Mahra M1 brand played a critical role in that transformation, redefining her image from royal daughter to luxury entrepreneur. She has also built a social presence rooted in individuality, decision-making, and global relevance.From building a commercial brand to forging high-profile connections, Sheikha Mahra is leveraging her background to create new avenues of financial and cultural influence, making her one of the most closely watched royals in the region today.","Sheikha Mahra is the daughter of Dubai’s ruler and a well-known figure in Emirati high society.

Ukraine allows young men to leave the country: Why Kyiv is suddenly easing its wartime travel ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ukraine-allows-young-men-to-leave-the-country-why-kyiv-is-suddenly-easing-its-wartime-travel-ban/articleshow/123564558.cms,"Image: UNICEF

What has changed for Ukraine’s young men

‘Will Rip Apart…’: Putin Dares Trump As US Mulls Tomahawks For Ukraine | Watch

Why is Ukraine making this change now

Pressure from allies versus domestic priorities



Families welcome the change

What it means for Ukraine’s war





For the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Ukraine is easing its strict wartime travel restrictions on men. A new regulation, effective August 29, 2025, will allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave the country freely until they turn 23. The move marks a significant shift from the blanket ban that had barred all men between 18 and 60 from traveling abroad, even those not yet eligible for the draft. Kyiv says the change is aimed at education, employment, and keeping younger Ukrainians tied to their homeland, but it raises questions about military manpower.Since the start of martial law in 2022, Ukraine barred men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, ensuring a reserve pool of soldiers. Now, for the first time, men between 18 and 22 are allowed to travel abroad until they turn 23. This creates a five-year window where they can pursue studies, internships, or jobs outside Ukraine before becoming subject to the draft again.Government officials say the change is meant to reduce the pressure on families and discourage teenagers from fleeing before they turn 18. Instead of being forced into permanent exile, young men will be able to leave legally, gain international experience, and later return to support Ukraine with their skills.The timing of this policy change reflects both practical and political concerns. After three years of war, Ukraine faces not only a battlefield challenge but also a demographic crisis. The country already has one of the fastest-declining populations in Europe, worsened by refugee outflows, falling birth rates, and war casualties. The pool of men in their early 20s is particularly small, owing to demographic dips after the collapse of the Soviet Union.By giving young men a chance to leave temporarily, Ukraine is signaling that it wants to maintain ties with its youth rather than push them into permanent exile. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko explained that many teenagers had fled before turning 18 out of fear of being trapped, and this rule aims to stop that exodus. The government also believes the change may improve morale among young people and families, who often feel caught between duty to the state and personal safety.Ukraine’s Western allies, particularly the United States, have been urging Kyiv to expand its mobilization pool. American lawmakers have openly suggested lowering the draft age to 18, arguing that Ukraine must maximize every available soldier if it hopes to withstand Russia’s larger military and population base.Instead of complying, Kyiv has gone in the opposite direction—loosening restrictions and allowing more young men to leave. To some, this looks like a contradiction in the middle of a grinding war of attrition. Military analysts note that Ukraine’s manpower shortages are one of its most serious challenges on the battlefield, and shrinking the mobilization reserve could make matters worse.Ukrainian officials defend the move as necessary to preserve social cohesion. They argue that forcing young men to stay creates resentment, weakens trust in the government, and encourages illegal migration. By offering legal pathways to travel, the government hopes to maintain loyalty and keep young Ukrainians invested in the country’s future.Among ordinary Ukrainians, the decision is broadly popular. Families who previously rushed to send their sons abroad before their 18th birthdays now have more time to make decisions without feeling panicked. Refugee families with sons who turned 18 while abroad also gain peace of mind, as those young men can now visit Ukraine temporarily without the risk of being trapped.Mothers, in particular, describe the new regulation as a relief. Many say it gives their children the chance to experience a normal life—seeing the sea, traveling without fear, or simply taking a break from the daily reality of air raid sirens. For families still in Ukraine, the rule offers a psychological cushion, making them feel less pressured and more hopeful about the future.The broader implications of this move are still unclear. On the one hand, it reduces Ukraine’s short-term mobilization pool at a time when its military is struggling with exhaustion, casualties, and recruitment shortages. Military experts warn that any reduction in available manpower could weaken Kyiv’s ability to sustain a prolonged conflict against Russia’s much larger population and army.On the other hand, some analysts argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. By keeping young Ukrainians connected to their homeland, Kyiv hopes to ensure that when they do return, they will bring back knowledge, resources, and international connections that strengthen the country. This policy change is part of a broader effort to maintain national connections and address demographic challenges amid ongoing martial law. The decision also reflects a broader understanding that war is not fought only on the battlefield but also in society—where trust, morale, and future stability matter as much as troop numbers.Ultimately, the new regulation represents a gamble: Ukraine is betting that preserving the future of its youth is worth the risk of a smaller mobilization pool today. Whether this gamble pays off may depend on how long the war drags on—and whether Western allies see this move as strengthening or undermining Ukraine’s war effort.","For the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Ukraine is easing its strict wartime travel restrictions on men.

US Army is using TikTok to recruit young soldiers: How influencers are selling military life to Gen Z,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-army-is-using-tiktok-to-recruit-young-soldiers-how-influencers-are-selling-military-life-to-gen-z/articleshow/123563675.cms,"The US Army’s TikTok strategy to recruit young soldiers

The rise of military influencers

Controversy and criticism surround TikTok recruitment strategy

What this means for Gen Z recruitment





The US Army has increasingly embraced social media to reach its next generation of recruits, with TikTok emerging as a surprising tool in this strategy. Although the platform is officially banned on government devices due to security concerns, recruiters and influencers are still using it to promote enlistment. Young soldiers and veterans share polished videos that highlight the benefits of service, from educational opportunities and financial stability to camaraderie and adventure. This shift represents a significant change in recruitment methods, targeting Gen Z where they spend much of their time, scrolling on social media platforms.Despite ongoing political scrutiny over TikTok’s Chinese ownership, the platform remains one of the most effective ways of engaging Gen Z audiences. Traditional recruitment methods such as posters, leaflets, or television adverts rarely capture the attention of young people today. In contrast, short, engaging clips that align with popular trends, music and humour present military life as both relatable and aspirational. From behind-the-scenes looks at training to humorous portrayals of daily routines, TikTok allows the Army to project an image of service that feels modern and accessible.An increasing number of military-affiliated influencers have appeared on TikTok, attracting audiences that number from thousands to millions. Many are current or former soldiers who act as unofficial ambassadors for the Army. Their videos often highlight the perceived benefits of enlistment, ranging from financial security and healthcare to subsidised education and opportunities for global travel. While some work directly with recruitment offices, others share their experiences independently. For many young viewers, this influencer-driven content is far more persuasive than official recruitment campaigns, presenting the Army as an attainable and rewarding career choice.The Army’s reliance on TikTok has sparked debate. Critics argue that presenting service through carefully curated content risks downplaying the dangers, sacrifices and mental toll associated with military life. Others highlight the irony of the US Army turning to a platform that American lawmakers frequently describe as a security threat. Still, the strategy continues, largely because it delivers results. Recruitment numbers among Gen Z, often sceptical of traditional authority, show signs of improvement when relatable influencers deliver the message.By embedding itself in the digital lives of young people, the US Army is reshaping its recruitment approach. Rather than relying solely on schools, career fairs or conventional advertising, the military is now meeting Gen Z on the platforms they use daily. This reflects a wider trend of institutions adapting to the attention economy, where relatability and influence can outweigh formality and authority. It shows that in the era of memes and short videos, even something as serious as military recruitment has to keep up with the scroll. Whether this strategy secures long-term recruitment success or draws further criticism, it highlights the immense power of social media in shaping decisions as significant as joining the armed forces.","The US Army has increasingly embraced social media to reach its next generation of recruits.

Details of the sunspot activity

On Tuesday evening, several of the year’s largest sunspots were spotted in the skies above Arar, drawing attention from astronomers to their size, visibility, and potential effects on Earth.Members of the Space and Astronomy Club confirmed that the sunspots visible this week included spots 4195, 4197, and 4199, each among the most significant recorded in 2025. According to club member Adnan Khalifah, these are temporary dark regions on the Sun’s surface formed by magnetic activity. Though they appear darker, they still emit light and remain highly radiant.Each sunspot observed measures tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, with several exceeding the size of Earth multiple times over. They were visible through small telescopes equipped with safe solar filters, allowing both professional and amateur astronomers to track the phenomenon.Experts explained that sunspot activity is linked to solar flares and geomagnetic storms, which can interfere with satellite navigation systems and global communications. Monitoring these changes is critical to understanding the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle, which influences the frequency and intensity of such disturbances.Astronomers further emphasized that public observation and amateur contributions are essential, as they not only add to monitoring efforts but also encourage broader scientific awareness and interest in space research.","Sunspots 4195, 4197, and 4199 are among the most significant recorded in 2025.

US CDC chief quits: Susan Monarez resigns weeks into role; vaccine policy rift with RFK Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cdc-chief-quits-susan-monarez-resigns-weeks-into-role-vaccine-policy-rift-with-kennedy/articleshow/123552330.cms,"Susan Monarez (left), Robert F kennedy (AP)

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

‘Living in terror’: Trump’s law enforcement surge sparks anxiety in DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/living-in-terror-trumps-law-enforcement-surge-sparks-anxiety-in-dc-mayor-bowser-raises-concerns/articleshow/123567598.cms,"Muriel Bowser (left), Donald Trump (AP)

As US President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement surge nears the end of its third week in Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.While Bowser acknowledged that the increased federal presence has helped push crime trends in a positive direction, she criticised the role of masked ICE agents and out-of-state national guard troops operating in the city, according to a report by WTOPnews.“There’s tremendous anxiety in the District,” Bowser said at a recent press conference. “When I look and I see residents putting things on social media or neighborhood chats, I know that there is a lot of anxiety. There’s a lot of anxiety with kids going back to school,” as quoted by the portal.The Mayor specifically referred to a recent incident reported by the news agency AP, where federal officers made an arrest near Bancroft Elementary School in Mount Pleasant, prompting chants from residents. Some of the officers reportedly had their faces covered, further intensifying public fear.Bowser confirmed to the portal that US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents have been riding along with DC police officers during traffic stops, particularly those involving mopeds.However, the city, she said, has no access to information about who ICE detains.“I am concerned, for sure, because we think anything that we do and anything that we’re going to ask federal partners to do is focused on violent crime,” she said.DC is home to many residents with temporary protected status, and Bowser warned that the current enforcement approach risks alienating both documented and undocumented individuals.“Whether you have documents or you’re undocumented, you almost feel like you’re being caught up in a dragnet, and that is horrible,” she said. To Hispanic workers living in fear, she added: “I would express to them as a neighbor how very sorry I am that they’re living in this terror,” the mayor was quoted.Police chief Pamela Smith also acknowledged the hesitation among residents to reach out for help due to fear. Deputy mayor for public safety and justice Lindsey Appiah reiterated the city’s appeal: “We do want people to continue to call when they need help.”The federal deployment is currently set to end on September 10 unless President Trump seeks congressional approval for an extension. Bowser said the city would be ready to work with federal resources differently once the 30-day period ends.“We will be prepared to take advantage of additional federal officers to focus on beautification, to support the federal task force, when that time period expires,” she said.Despite tensions, crime in the city is reportedly down compared to the same period last year. Bowser also emphasised the need to strengthen DC’s police force by hiring 500 more officers to reach a 4,000-member target over the coming years.",DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.

Minneapolis Shooting: Leavitt Blasts Jen Psaki’s ‘Prayer’ Comment; Gives Big Probe Update





Former White House press secretary and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki launched a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing them of offering only “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of a deadly school shooting in Minneapolis.In a strongly worded post on X, Psaki dsaid traditional calls for prayer not enough, targeting Trump administration's condolatory remarks on the Annunciation school shooting. “Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers do not end school shootings. Prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers,” she wrote.Psaki, who served as President Joe Biden’s press secretary, accused American leaders of falling into a repetitive cycle after every mass shooting. “Like clockwork, half the politicians in our country have little more to offer than thoughts and prayers — that is all they are offering,” she said during her MSNBC segment.She singled out Trump and Vance for limiting their initial responses to urging the public to join them in prayer. “We have seen this play out over and over. There is a shooting, then come the thoughts and prayers and then comes the attempt to shift the focus,” Psaki added, warning that discussions about the shooter’s transgender identity were being used as a distraction from the larger issue of gun control.Her remarks sparked a sharp reaction online, with critics accusing her of politicising a tragedy and showing disrespect toward faith-based traditions of mourning.“I don’t expect a spiritually blind person to understand prayer, but it is real. Today I attended the funeral of a baby, and often when parents are in the depths of grief, Jesus is their greatest comforter. You should investigate why that is, rather than belittling it,” Karen Hamilton, a candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates, said in response.Authorities said two children, aged 8 and 10, were killed and at least 17 injured in Minneapolis school shooting when the gunman opened fire during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman was found dead due to self-inflicted injuries.","Former White House press secretary and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki launched a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

Two Microsoft employees were sacked on Wednesday after staging a sit-in protest at the office of company president Brad Smith, demanding the tech giant end its business ties with Israel amid the Gaza war.A Microsoft spokesperson said the employees were terminated for “serious breaches of company policies and code of conduct” following what the firm described as “a break-in at the executive offices.”The two employees were part of a protest group, 'Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli were informed of their dismissal through voicemail. Both were among seven protesters arrested on Tuesday during the office occupation.

The probe also claimed that Israel relied heavily on Microsoft’s technology for surveillance operations in Gaza and the West Bank.Microsoft said it was examining claims that Israel’s military has relied on its Azure cloud service to store vast amounts of phone data gathered through surveillance of Palestinians.This is not the first time Microsoft has faced employee dissent over the issue.

50-minute call with engineers: USAF pilot's desperate bid to save snag-hit F-35; Alaska crash report released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/50-minute-call-with-engineers-usaf-pilots-desperate-bid-to-save-snag-hit-f-35-alaska-crash-report-released/articleshow/123560584.cms,"The USAF F-35 jet crash in Alaska

Before ejecting from a US Air Force F-35 fighter jet that crashed in Alaska in January , the pilot spent nearly an hour on a mid-air conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers in an attempt to resolve the issue, according to an accident report released this week.As per the CNN-published report, the incident began shortly after take-off when the pilot attempted to retract the landing gear. The gear failed to retract fully, and when he lowered it again, the nose wheel locked at an angle to the left.After running through system checklists, the pilot initiated a mid-air conference call with five engineers from Lockheed Martin, the plane's manufacturer. The group included: a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three landing-gear specialists. The call lasted 50 minutes as they tried to troubleshoot the malfunction.The pilot then attempted two “touch-and-go” landings - brief contacts with the runway designed to realign the jammed nose wheel. Instead, the manoeuvres caused further damage, leaving both the left and right main landing gears frozen and unable to extend for a safe landing.At that stage, the F-35’s sensors mistakenly registered that the jet was on the ground, triggering a switch to “automated ground-operation mode.”This left the aircraft effectively “uncontrollable,” as its systems responded as though it was on the ground, rather than flying.With no other options left, the pilot ejected. The jet dropped straight down and exploded in a fireball.The January 28 crash at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska's Fairbanks was recorded in a video that showed the aircraft dropping straight down and exploding in a fireball. The pilot suffered only minor injuries.A US Air Force investigation later determined that the crash was caused by ice in the hydraulic lines of the nose and main landing gears, which prevented them from functioning properly.","The January 28 crash at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska's Fairbanks was recorded in a video that showed the aircraft dropping straight down and exploding in a fireball.

Poll Do you support the US move to fix admission periods for foreign students and visitors? Yes, it ensures better oversight No, it creates unnecessary hurdles

We're going to change the green card: Trump official



The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has unveiled a new proposal to impose fixed admission periods on foreign students, exchange visitors and representatives of overseas media, ending the decades-old practice of granting stays of indefinite “duration of status. ” The Trump administration said the change is designed to curb visa abuse and strengthen oversight.“For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the US virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging US citizens,” a DHS spokesperson said. “This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the US, easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and their history. ”Officials argue that fixed terms would allow officers to “periodically and directly assess whether nonimmigrants are complying with the conditions of their classifications and US immigration laws.” According to DHS, the absence of clear end dates under the current system “does not afford immigration officers enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that aliens are engaging only in authorised activities.The United States is set to overhaul its immigration policies, with particular focus on the H-1B visa programme and green cards, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Speaking to Fox News, Lutnick revealed plans for a new “gold card” initiative, offering permanent residency to wealthy foreigners who invest USD 5 million in the US. “I'm involved in changing the H1B visa program. We're going to change that program because that's terrible right. We're going to change the green card,” Lutnick said. He added, “That's the gold card that's coming. And that's we're gonna start picking the best people to come into this country. It's time for that to change.”Despite previously criticising the H-1B programme, Trump has recently reaffirmed support for it, saying that there is a need for “competent” and “great” individuals. However, the administration has also launched a sweeping review of all 55 million active visas globally, including over five million held by Indians. This includes social media checks, electronic device data, and IRS tax records. Violations may result in visa revocations and deportations. Critics, including the ACLU, warn these measures threaten civil liberties and risk economic harm. Nonetheless, officials insist the policies are essential for national security, despite concerns of discrimination and disruption.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has unveiled a new proposal to impose fixed admission periods on foreign students, exchange visitors and representatives of overseas media.

Trump Furious As Israel Hits Gaza Hospital; Bashes Bibi After 20 Kids, Journalists Killed

President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) chaired a 'policy meet' to hold discussions on the future of Gaza at the White House, which was breifed by former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who presented ideas for a 'post-war' plan.While the specifics of the 'plan' remain unclear, the talks centred on governance, humanitarian assistance and security arrangements in Gaza, including talks on boosting food aid deliveries, resolving the hostage crisis, and shaping proposals for Gaza’s future once the conflict ends, were discussed for over an hour, according to Reuters.Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a key architect of Trump’s Middle East policy during his first term but does not hold a formal role in the current administration, has been informally advising White House officials since Trump returned to office in January.The session was also attended by US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and other senior administration aides.Ahead of the talks, Witkoff had told Fox News that Trump would convene “a large meeting” on Gaza. “It is a very comprehensive plan we are putting together on the next day (in Gaza), and many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is. It reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here,” he said.He also suggested the administration believes the war could end by the end of this year.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is under growing pressure from protesters and the country’s military leadership to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal, instead of pushing ahead with his plan to broaden the military offensive.Witkoff has been in regular contact with Blair and Kushner for several months over the post-war strategy, reported Axios. Blair had met Witkoff at the White House in July — the same day Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred with Trump, before briefing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the discussions in Washington.The details of Trump’s post-war blueprint remain unclear, particularly on how Gaza’s reconstruction would be carried out and who would ultimately oversee the enclave’s governance.","Donald Trump holds meeting on Gaza City post-war plan.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

Sri Lanka's jailed former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Colombo National Hospital on Saturday, a day after being charged with misusing government funds for foreign travel.The deputy director-general of hospital Rukshan Bellana said that Wickremesinghe was reportedly severely dehydrated and required close monitoring.

(AP

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries. The Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia. But these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123342996,imgsize-256134,width-400,resizemode-4/123342996.jpg"
Insights from UK’s unlikely ‘Blue Zone’ where people regularly live past 100,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/insights-from-uks-unlikely-blue-zone-where-people-regularly-live-past-100/articleshow/123548599.cms,"Blue Zones and the habits that make them extraordinary



Plymouth: The UK’s healthiest midlifers and their lifestyle patterns

Diet and lifestyle: Key drivers of healthy ageing and longevity



Purpose, relationships, and mental wellness: Building a long, fulfilling life



Midlife clarity: Knowing your health inside out

Practical health steps for midlifers

Exercise snacking: Short bursts of 3–5 minutes of activity during work or daily routines help maintain strength and mobility.

Sleep optimization: Aim for around seven hours of restorative sleep nightly to support cognitive and physical health.

Mindful eating: Focus on a plant-rich diet, follow the 80 percent rule, and avoid overconsumption of processed foods and red meat.

Purpose and social connections: Invest in relationships, community, hobbies, and personal passions to enhance mental wellbeing.

Regular health checks: Utilize midlife health assessments and screenings to detect early changes and maintain control over long-term health.

Lessons from global Blue Zones applied to the UK

By the sea in southwest England, a surprising trend is emerging—residents of Plymouth are living longer, healthier lives than most of their UK peers. According to a Daily Mail report on the Midlife Clarity Index study by Vista Health, Plymouth stands out as the UK city with the healthiest midlifers—people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who enjoy strong health, low incidence of chronic disease, and overall wellbeing. This mirrors global Blue Zones, such as Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, Ikaria in Greece, and Loma Linda in California, where lifestyle, diet, and community bonds play a decisive role in extended lifespans and higher quality of life.Blue Zones are regions where people consistently live beyond 100 while experiencing lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia as reported by Daily Mail. Studies of these areas reveal nine shared habits, called the “Power Nine”: consistent physical activity integrated into daily life, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, moderate alcohol consumption, deep family ties, strong social engagement, stress reduction practices, spiritual or purposeful living, and the avoidance of overeating. These lifestyle habits collectively reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and enhance mental and physical resilience, contributing to longevity and happiness.The Midlife Clarity Index, which surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities, used metrics such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, stress management, and sleep quality to rank midlife health. Plymouth topped the list thanks to strong scores for daily activity, high intake of fruits and vegetables, and sufficient restorative sleep. Midlifers in Plymouth typically engage in around two hours of exercise weekly—not including walking, gardening, or other routine movement. This combination of plant-rich diet, regular physical activity, and stress management mirrors global longevity practices and positions residents for longer, healthier lives.A plant-focused diet is central to long life, with Blue Zone research showing that beans, legumes, whole grains, and seasonal vegetables form the core of daily meals. Meat is eaten sparingly, often only a few times a month, while the “80 per cent rule” prevents overeating and promotes mindful consumption. As reported by the Daily Mail, Plymouth’s midlifers are increasingly following these principles, boosting gut health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Combined with gentle but consistent physical activity and seven hours of sleep nightly, these habits strengthen cardiovascular health, support cognitive function, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other age-related conditions.Longevity is not just about diet and exercise; mental wellbeing and social engagement are equally critical. Health experts quoted by the Daily Mail highlight that maintaining meaningful relationships and investing in community connections can reduce the likelihood of dementia by up to 50 percent and extend life expectancy. Plymouth’s midlifers benefit from strong social networks, hobbies, volunteering, and pursuing passions that provide purpose, mirroring the concept of ikigai from Okinawa, Japan—a reason for being that nurtures both mental and emotional health.Vista Health’s Midlife Clarity Index emphasizes that midlife is the ideal time to take control of your health. In your 40s, 50s, and 60s, your body sends new signals—changes in sleep, energy, stress response, and recovery time—making this the right moment to pause and evaluate wellbeing. Common issues like back pain, knee discomfort, heart or prostate concerns, or unexplained symptoms can be assessed through trusted diagnostic scans and health checks. Vista Health provides private midlife health assessments, from full-body MRI scans to ultrasounds, helping individuals understand risks and take proactive steps before issues become limiting.The study highlights several actionable habits that midlifers can adopt:While the UK has no official Blue Zones, Plymouth demonstrates that adopting the principles of longevity—balanced diet, regular natural movement, social connection, meaningful purpose, and restorative sleep—can significantly improve health outcomes. By integrating these habits into daily life and using tools like Vista Health’s midlife assessments, individuals can reduce health risks, remain mentally sharp, and increase the likelihood of reaching 100. The findings emphasize that longevity is accessible to the broader population, not just elite biohackers or billionaires, and that small, consistent lifestyle choices have a profound impact on wellbeing.","The Midlife Clarity Index surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities.

in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale, which left many convinced that working-class girls are abandoned by the state. Distrust of authority: The perception that police and courts fail to protect the vulnerable, forcing communities to fend for themselves.

The far-right remix



Who is the man in the video?



He lives in a council property with his wife, Fatos Yulianova, 19, and their eight-month-old baby.

He first worked in a St Andrews restaurant after arriving in Scotland, and has studied English in Wales.

Police Scotland confirmed there is no evidence he committed any offence.

Daily Mail

“I never touched her. I didn’t hit her, I swear on my life. I have a baby now. I would never hurt someone.”

“I am not an illegal migrant. I have not done anything. I am a human not an animal.”

“If I did hurt the girl, why didn’t the police arrest me? They saw from CCTV I was stopped from going to the shop.”

Police response and political pushback



A familiar pattern



The law and the paradox of self-defence



Why it matters



A child in the spotlight: A 12-year-old has been thrust into a national culture war.

Disinformation at scale: Dumana, a young Bulgarian father, was smeared as an “illegal migrant” within hours.

Cultural resonance: The Braveheart analogy shows how Scotland frames defiance — but reality is more complex.

The risk of unrest: As with Southport, unchecked narratives risk spilling into real-world violence.

The bottom line



On August 23, a clip filmed in Dundee’s Lochee area went viral: a schoolgirl wielding a knife and an axe, shouting at a man while another girl tried to hold her back. Within hours, the footage had been amplified by figures like Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk, who claimed the man was a “migrant” and used the incident to fuel anti-immigration anger. The girl, aged 12, was later charged with possession of offensive weapons.The Dundee video resonated because it carried three explosive elements:For supporters online, the girl was not just a child with a knife — she was a symbol of Britain’s deeper failings.The far-right narrative was quick to take shape: a “native girl” defending her sister from a predatory foreigner. Robinson and Musk implied that the man was fresh off a “small boats” crossing, and online forums branded the girl a modern Braveheart figure, standing against an “alien threat.”The imagery tapped into Scotland’s enduring mythos of defiance — though in reality, this was not a Mel Gibson war epic, but a grim confrontation on a housing estate verge.The man wrongly cast as a migrant predator has now been identified as Fatos Ali Dumana, 21, a Bulgarian national who has lived in Dundee since 2021.Speaking to the, Dumana rejected the claims against him:Police Scotland said the girl has been charged and will be referred to the relevant authorities.They stressed that “misinformation” about Dumana’s status was false. Former Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf was more blunt, dismissing the far-right framing: “Who would have guessed the far right were full of bulls**.”*The Dundee incident follows a pattern seen before. In Southport in 2024, riots erupted after false claims spread about a stabbing suspect’s identity. The choreography is familiar: partial facts, viral amplification, political reframing — and a local clash becomes a national flashpoint.UK law bans minors from carrying knives. While self-defence is legally recognised, “reasonable force” rarely extends to waving a blade in public.This creates a paradox. In the eyes of the law, the girl is a child charged with a weapons offence. In the eyes of many online, she is a victim forced into self-defence.The grooming gang shadow: Old scandals mean new incidents are viewed through the lens of institutional failure.A Saturday evening confrontation in Dundee has been transformed into a parable of Britain’s anxieties. A child has been charged, while a Bulgarian man — wrongly accused online — insists he has done nothing wrong. The myths travelled faster than the facts, merging grooming gang trauma, immigration fears, and Scottish defiance into a viral storm. The Braveheart echoes explain the emotional charge, but the truth is simpler: a frightened girl, a family man, and a country still fighting its culture wars.","A 12-year-old girl has been thrust into a national culture war.

‘Aided the rape epidemic of their own people’: Elon Musk renews attacks on UK officials over grooming gang scandal; pledges to fund legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/aided-the-rape-epidemic-of-their-own-people-elon-musk-renews-attacks-on-uk-officials-over-grooming-gang-scandal-pledges-to-fund-legal-action/articleshow/123542975.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs, following fresh claims that child sexual exploitation has taken place across dozens of local authorities.In a post on X, Musk wrote, “Start by condemning the grovelers and collaborators in positions of authority in Britain who aided the rape epidemic of their own people or turned a blind eye to their responsibilities. Both civil and criminal prosecutions.”His comment came in response to a user who shared the photo of a 14-year-old girl arrested in Dundee after allegedly carrying a bladed weapon, as reported by The Courier.The user had claimed teenage girls were resorting to defending themselves from rape, accusing police of failing to protect victims.Earlier, Musk replied to British MP Rupert Lowe, who chairs an unofficial “Rape Gang Inquiry.” Quoting Lowe’s findings, Musk posted: “85 cities in Britain where local authorities were complicit in the rape of children …”Lowe had announced that his inquiry uncovered evidence of gang-based sexual exploitation in 85 local authorities, describing it as “one of the most comprehensive exposés of the rape gang scandal to date.”He said the inquiry had received testimonies from survivors and families, alongside thousands of Freedom of Information requests.Musk has also pledged to fund legal action against “corrupt officials” accused of covering up abuse. In a separate post, he wrote: “I would like to help fund legal actions against corrupt officials who aided and abetted the rape of Britain, per the official government inquiry.”The billionaire later posted an image of the national flag of England, fuelling speculation about his intent to continue intervening in the debate.The issue of grooming gangs has gained renewed prominence since June, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to a government-backed national inquiry, reversing Labour’s earlier stance. Survivors and campaigners have since pressed the government to deliver on promises of justice.Lowe said his team’s research shows the problem stretches back to the 1960s and spans towns and cities across the UK. “The message from survivors is clear: get on with it. There have been too many broken promises,” he said, as cited by The Telegraph.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs.

LONDON: Indian nationals in the UK saw the largest increase in sexual offence convictions here of all foreign nationals in the four years from 2021 to 2024, new data shows.There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences in Britain over the period, followed by Nigerian nationals who saw an increase of 166% and Iraqis (160% increase). Indians were convicted of 100 sexual offences in 2024 compared to 28 in 2021.UK’s ministry of justice (MoJ) said the data relates to sentencing occasions rather than individual offenders.The statistics were taken from MoJ data drawn from the Police National Computer and obtained by the think tank Centre for Migration Control via a freedom of information request to the MoJ.Indians had the third-highest increase in convictions for serious offences of all foreign nationals between 2021 and 2024 at 115%, with the second-highest being Algerian, and the highest being Egyptian. There was a total of 588 convictions of Indian nationals for serious offences in 2024 compared to 273 in 2021.This comes as new immigration data released by the home office shows that in 2024 a total of 293 Indian nationals arrived in the UK illegally via small boat and 206 have arrived between Jan and June this year. Indians are a tiny proportion, though, as the largest cohort last year came from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.Indians made up 15% of illegal arrivals at UK ports in the year ending June 2025 when there were 5,474 asylum applications made by Indian nationals, of which, rounded to the nearest 100, 4,000 were made by those who had come to the UK on a legal visa, mostly study visas, 400 were made by those who came on small boats, and the rest entered through other means. For asylum initial decisions for Indians, 2,691 were refused in the year ending June 2025, while 20 were granted asylum, and the rest are awaiting a decision.Indians were the largest group to gain citizenship and received the highest number of work visas and tourist visas of any nationality in the year ending June 2025.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

SIDOARJO: Indonesian rescuers searching for missing students after a prayer hall at a boarding school collapsed on Tuesday recovered more than two dozen bodies over the weekend search, bringing the confirmed death toll to 45.Using jackhammers, circular saws and sometimes their bare hands, rescue teams removed rubble in an attempt to find the 18 students reportedly still missing.Police said two levels were being added to the two-storey building without a permit, leading to structural failure. ""The construction couldn't support the load while the concrete was pouring (to build) the third floor,"" said Mudji Irmawan, a construction expert.","Rescuers searching for missing students recovered more than two dozen bodies over the weekend.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss?

Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

First in 500 years: Ex-nurse Sarah Mullally named Church of England's first female Archbishop of Canterbury; who is she,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-in-500-years-ex-nurse-sarah-mullally-named-church-of-englands-first-female-archbishop-of-canterbury-who-is-she/articleshow/124288159.cms,"Sarah Mullally

Who is Sarah Mullally?



Why the role matters







The Church of England, founded in 1554, will be led by a woman for the first time, as Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest-ranking bishop in the Church.Mullally, 63, succeeds 105 men to become the first woman to lead the Anglican Communion, which comprises 85 million (8.5 crore) members worldwide.She will succeed former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November last year following an independent investigation. The probe found that he had failed to report to the police instances of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps, despite being aware of them.According to the BBC, Mullally is a former National Health Service (NHS) nurse who became a priest in 2006. In 2018, she was appointed as the first female Bishop of London, making her the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She spent over 35 years in the NHS, and in 1999, became the youngest-ever Chief Nursing Officer for England. A few years later, she decided to pursue the priesthood.In 2012, Mullally became canon treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral, and three years later, she was appointed Bishop of Crediton in the Diocese of Exeter.Mullally will not formally assume her new role until a confirmation of election in January, followed by an enthronement service after paying homage to King Charles III, the head of state.Women were first ordained as priests in the Church of England in 1994, with the first female bishops appointed two decades later, in 2014.Although the monarch—King Charles III in this case—is the formal head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is its most senior bishop and serves as the spiritual leader of both the Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes numerous national churches.The Archbishop carries the title “Primate of All England,” reflecting their seniority as the “first bishop” in England.","Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

Shutdown or not, the show goes on — and so does the Trump dance. In Norfolk, Virginia, the Navy’s 250th anniversary bash turned into a spectacle Sunday when US President Donald Trump capped his speech with his trademark moves to ‘YMCA,’ sending a crowd of 10,000 roaring with delight.The shutdown has resulted in thousands of federal employees being furloughed and has delayed key projects in Democratic-run areas such as New York and Chicago.Trump criticised Democrats for the impasse, assuring that service members would receive their full pay despite the stalemate. Senate Democrats, however, expressed concerns over healthcare subsidies, Medicaid cuts, and spending priorities, leading them to reject efforts to extend government operations.During the celebration, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the USS George HW Bush, where they met with sailors, distributed challenge coins, and observed military demonstrations.“Let’s face it, this is a rally,” President Donald J. Trump told a crowd of approximately 10,000 sailors dressed in white uniforms on Sunday.The event took place on a pier situated between two towering Navy vessels, an aircraft carrier and an amphibious assault ship.A Navy fighter jet, bearing the inscription “President Donald J. Trump ‘45-47’” on its fuselage beneath the cockpit window, was displayed on the carrier.Navy planes flew overhead as the President commenced his speech, energising the crowd and prompting many sailors to chant “USA! USA! USA!”Trump criticised his political opponents and attacked Democratic lawmakers amidst a government shutdown entering its fifth day. The shutdown has resulted in military personnel working without pay until the government reopens.“I want you to know that despite the current Democrat induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny. Don’t worry about it,"" Trump assured, receiving cheers from the audience.Addressing the generals, Trump proposed utilising US cities as training grounds for the armed forces and emphasised the necessity of military strength to combat what he described as the “invasion from within.”Hegseth declared an end to “woke” culture and announced new directives for troops, including “gender-neutral” and “male-level” standards for physical fitness. The administration is endeavouring to reshape Pentagon culture and deploy military resources to advance the President’s priorities, which include suppressing domestic unrest and violent crime.Additionally, Trump has involved the military in armed conflict with drug cartels, resulting in four strikes on boats in the Caribbean that Washington claims were engaged in trafficking.","President Donald J.

A 51-year-old motel owner in Robinson was shot in the head when he stepped outside of his motel to check on a dispute reportedly going on at the parking lot. Police identified the motel owner as Rakesh Ehagaban who died at the spot. The shooter, identified as Stanley Eugene West, a 37-year-old man, shot him in the head when Rakesh asked him: ""Are you alright, bud?""Rakesh responded to a situation that arose when West shot his female companion. West also shot a cop who tracked him to the East Hills of Pittsburgh after he left the motel. Both the woman and the police were taken to a hospital. West was staying in a room at the motel in Robinson, police said. He also is associated with a residence on Page Street on Pittsburgh’s North Side.According to the arrest papers, Robinson police were dispatched to the Dick Kernick Tire & Auto Service Center at about 1 p.m. where West’s female companion had driven after being shot in the neck while she was sitting in a car in the motel parking lot. The woman had a child with her who was not injured.Police said the woman was attempting to drive away from the motel Friday and, as her black sedan began to move forward toward the exit, West approached the driver’s side door and shot at the sedan, shattering the driver’s door window.That incident is what drew Rakesh outside where he was shot, according to police.After shooting Ehagaban, the shooter walked away nonchalantly.“The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is grateful to the incredible care provided by the doctors and nurses at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital and to all of our local law enforcement partners who work so hard to keep Allegheny County safe in the fight against violent crime,” acting Chief Martin Devine said in the statement.","A 51-year-old motel owner in Robinson was shot in the head when he stepped outside of his motel to check on a dispute reportedly going on at the parking lot.

Appearing on MSNBC, Wolfers said studies have revealed that H-1B inflow actually increased the wages of American college grads and the native employment figures did not change because of H-1B hirings.""If H‑1Bs took jobs, you’d expect lower wages for U.S. grads. The best available studies show the opposite: 1990–2010 H‑1B inflows raised wages of American college grads by 4.2% and non‑college by ~2%, with native employment unchanged,"" he said.The economist said that it is one way of thinking that if somebody is coming to the US, they are taking someone's jobs. ""But facts don't bear that out,"" he said, adding that all economic activities in the US are like a cake and H-1B is a key ingredient. If the US does not have a specific ingredient to bake the economy cake, they can 'instacart' STEM workers through the H-1B program. Without the ingredient, US will have to quit baking, make inferior quality products or buy a cake instead of baking it.Wolfers said all these options are not good for the US economy.Wolfers said more H1B means more patents, more productivity, as H-1Bs are not just workers; they cross the ocean bringing their fresh new ideas with them.As his cake analogy went viral, many social media users attacked him and said there's no ingredient missing.

An Indian student recently received a visa rejection letter from the US that said they were not convinced that he had sufficient ties to India that would compel him to return to India after his time in the United States. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaushik Raj revealed that he made it clear during the application process that he was born and brought up in India and that his entire family lives in India. Kaushik Raj told Post that he feels the rejection came after the US officials went through his social media profiles, which is now a mandatory process for a visa.Kaushik Raj said he was not active on social media and did not post anything on controversial issues, but he spent four years working as a journalist and posted links of his stories. The rejection letter, however, did not mention social media profiles as a reason for rejection.The 27-year-old applied for a visa as he won a $100,000 scholarship to pursue a graduate degree in journalism at Columbia University.The rejection letter said: ""You were not able to demonstrate that your intended activities in the United States would be consistent with the classification of the nonimmigrant visa for which you applied.""It said that an applicant has to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning.""Applicants usually meet this requirement by demonstrating that they have strong ties overseas that indicate they will return to a foreign country after a temporary visit to the United States.

‘Not War, But...’: Trump's EXPLOSIVE Answer On Deploying Troops To Chicago I National Guard





The Trump administration on Sunday described Chicago as a ""war zone"" as it authorised the deployment of federal troops to the city - despite firm opposition from local Democratic leaders. The move came amid mounting criticism that US President Donald Trump is using law enforcement and military powers to assert political control over Democrat-run cities.Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, defending the deployment on Fox News, said, “Chicago is a war zone.” The statement followed Trump’s late Saturday order to send 300 national guard troops to the city, a decision opposed by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and other elected officials, reported AFP.In response, Pritzker accused Republicans of creating chaos as a pretext for increased federal intervention. “They want to create the war zone, so that they can send in even more troops,” he said on CNN’s state of the union. “They need to get the heck out,” as quoted by the agency.The clash highlights a growing political divide over law enforcement and migration policy, with Trump repeatedly invoking the need for stronger action in cities he describes as lawless.Last week, he vowed to combat what he called a “war from within.”However, his plan to extend troop deployments hit a legal hurdle. In Portland, Oregon, a federal court temporarily blocked the deployment of troops, calling the administration’s justification legally baseless.US district judge Karin Immergut ruled that the violence in Portland did not amount to an organised rebellion. “This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,” she wrote, stating that the president’s decision was “untethered to the facts.”Despite scattered attacks on federal property in Portland, the court found no evidence to justify treating the situation as an insurrection under federal law.Meanwhile, house speaker Mike Johnson, a key Trump ally, described Washington DC as a “literal war zone,” echoing the administration’s rhetoric.The situation in Chicago also escalated over the weekend. According to the department of homeland security, a federal officer shot a motorist who allegedly rammed into a patrol vehicle. In a separate incident, ICE officers shot and killed 38-year-old immigrant Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a traffic stop on September 12. DHS claimed the individual tried to flee and dragged an officer with his car.The Trump administration has expanded the role of immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), with recent raids - often in unmarked vehicles - sparking protests in several Democratic-controlled cities.A CBS News poll released on Sunday showed that 58 per cent of Americans oppose the use of national guard troops in cities, while 42 per cent support the move.Despite legal and political opposition, the White House signalled no intent to back down. Trump aide Stephen Miller described the Portland court ruling as a “legal insurrection.”",US President Donald Trump authorised deployment of 300 national guard troops to Chicago on Saturday. Illinois governor JB Pritzker and other elected officials opposed the move. The move came amid mounting criticism that Trump is using law enforcement and military powers to assert political control over Democrat-run cities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124323242,imgsize-967499,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-left-jb-pritzker-ap.jpg"

Will Chandler Langevin be removed from his council post because of his anti-India comment?



Did thousands of Indian-Americans show up at the council meeting?







As Florida's Palm Bay Council is up in arms against councilman Chandler Langevin and calling him a cancer which should be removed immediately after he attacked the Indian-American community, several politicians came forward to condemn Langevin's racism. Republican Senator and former Governor Rick Scott said there's no place for hate in Florida.

Langevin deleted the controversial post though he said he was neither taking back his words nor apologizing.He said he did not target Indian-Americans; his attack was on illegals or visa holders.The council voted to remove him because of his anti-Indian rhetoric and sent a letter to Governor Ron DeSantis.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region. On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 leaving over 40 injured.

'Not ours': Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar distances from Donald Trump’s Gaza plan; claims ‘changes made to our draft’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/not-ours-pakistan-fm-ishaq-dar-distances-from-trumps-gaza-plan-claims-changes-made-to-our-draft/articleshow/124292502.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (left), Ishaq Dar (AP)

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Indonesia: 65 students trapped as school building collapses; 1 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-65-students-trapped-as-school-building-collapses-1-dead/articleshow/124224122.cms,"Poll Do you believe building regulations should be stricter to prevent similar incidents? Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

What is the plan?







The Conservative Party plans to launch a new ""Removals Force"" designed to deport 150,000 people each year as part of a wider strategy to address illegal immigration in the UK.Modeled on the “successful approach” of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the new Removals Force, unveiled on Sunday, is set to receive £1.6 billion in funding and “sweeping new powers,” including the ability to use facial recognition technology without prior warning to identify illegal immigrants.The force is expected to work “closely” with the police, who would be required to carry out immigration checks on all individuals they stop or arrest.The Conservative Party will unveil plans on Sunday, led by Kemi Badenoch, emphasizing “Strong Borders” as a key theme of their annual conference.“We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders,"" Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said, as cited by the Independent. “That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”Under the plan, the immigration tribunal would be abolished, with the Home Office handling all migration decisions and offering only limited appeal rights in cases where officials act beyond their statutory authority.The plan also proposes a major overhaul of the asylum system, limiting refugee status to individuals facing threats from foreign governments.The plan would also exclude individuals fleeing conflict or countries with “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality, with the party noting that “few people will qualify,"" as reported by the Independent.Immigration cases would no longer receive legal aid under the pln. The Conservatives accused solicitors of “defrauding” the UK by “coaching” applicants and argued that legal representation is unnecessary, claiming people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances.”On Saturday, Kemi Badenoch stated that the Conservatives would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election.The Conservative leadership is under persistent pressure on immigration from the party’s right, as polls suggest Reform UK could perform strongly in the next election despite holding only five MPs.The Conservative leadership is under persistent pressure on immigration from the party’s right, as polls suggest Reform UK could perform strongly in the next election despite holding only five MPs.","The Conservative Party plans to launch a new ""Removals Force"" designed to deport 150,000 people each year.

Six people arrested in this case



How the attack unfolded



Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area. Around 15 minutes later, the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack,"" the police said in a statement.“There were a large number of worshippers in attendance but thanks to the bravery of security staff, worshippers and the fast action of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,"" they added.Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle ""just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public"". She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later.

Woman appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in historic first,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/woman-appointed-archbishop-of-canterbury-in-historic-first/articleshow/124297755.cms,"Dame Sarah Mullally (AP photo)





LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16. She will be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal. Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124297752,imgsize-76968,width-400,resizemode-4/sarah-mullally-named-the-first-female-archbishop-of-canterbury.jpg"

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that the attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting in London, cutting short his trip to a European summit in Denmark. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism.Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife. Officers opened fire after issuing warnings, preventing the suspect from entering the building. “They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen until they opened fire,"" the witness told AFP.GMP said they received an alert shortly after 9:30 AM (0830 GMT) that a car had driven into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews.

A 65-year-old British Pakistani man, known as Boss Man, a grooming gang ringleader, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.Mohammed Zahid, father of three children, who showed a ""chilling disregard"" for the girls, was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences between 2001 and 2006. He gave the girls free underwear from his market stall, expecting regular sex for him and his friends in return, BBC reported.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, Kasir Bashir, 50, Mohammed Shahzad, 44, Naheem Akram, 49, Nisar Hussain, 41, and Roheez Khan, 39, also received lengthy prison sentences at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.The court heard how the girls were sexually exploited from the age of 13 in filthy flats, car parks, alleyways, and disused warehouses in the Greater Manchester town.Referred to as Girl A and Girl B, they were treated as ""sex slaves"" and expected to ""have sex with the men whenever and wherever they wanted."" Both girls, who were not acquainted with each other, had ""deeply troubled home lives"" and were provided with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and places to stay by the men, the court was told.During the sentencing, Judge Jonathan Seely described the treatment of the girls by the ""predatory"" men as ""appalling.""He said, ""They were abused, degraded and then discarded. It would have been obvious to these men that they craved the attention that their home lives didn't provide. They felt they had little or no choice but to submit to the almost incessant sexual abuse meted out to them.""All the paedophiles worked either at the market or as taxi drivers, the court heard.Girl A informed the jury that she may have been preyed on by hundreds of men as her phone number was circulated, adding, ""there was that many it was hard to keep count."" She told local children's services in 2004 that she was ""hanging around"" with groups of older men, drinking and smoking cannabis, the court was told.Girl B, who was residing in a children's home when she encountered the men at the market, claimed that police and social workers were aware of the situation but ""weren't concerned enough to do anything about it.""She said, ""It was in my file, when I looked it up. I read it. I was picked up by the police for loitering and prostituting from the age of 10."" Social services and police have previously apologised for their past failings regarding the girls.The convictions and sentences in full were as follows: - Pakistan-born Mohammed Zahid of Station Road, Crumpsall, was convicted of raping Girl A and Girl B, indecency with a child, and procuring a child to have sex and was jailed for 35 years.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, of Corona Avenue, Oldham, and Kasir Bashir, 50, of Napier Street East, Oldham, both born in Pakistan, were convicted of repeated counts of rape and indecency with a child in relation to Girl B and were jailed for 27 and 29 years respectively.Mohammed Shahzad, 44, of Beswicke Royds Street, Rochdale; Naheem Akram, 49, of Manley Road, Rochdale; and Nisar Hussain, 41, of New Field Close, Rochdale, were convicted of repeated counts of rape against Girl A and were jailed for 26, 26, and 19 years respectively.Pakistan-born Roheez Khan, 39, of Athole Street, Rochdale, was found guilty of a single count of rape against Girl A and jailed for 12 years. In 2016, Zahid was jailed for five years after being convicted of engaging in sexual activity in 2005 and 2006 with a 14-year-old girl whom he met when she visited his stall to buy tights for school. Bashir was sentenced in his absence after he absconded while on bail before the trial commenced.Detective Chief Inspector Guy Laycock from Greater Manchester Police stated that the men ""preyed on the girls' vulnerability for their own depraved sexual gain."" He added, ""This horrific abuse knew no limits, despite their denials throughout this lengthy investigation and court case.They had a callous disregard for these women when they were girls and continue to show no remorse for their unforgivable actions all these years later.""Liz Fell, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, commended the men for exploiting the teenagers' ""difficult circumstances"" and praised the victims for coming forward. She said, ""Both victims have shown an enormous amount of strength and dignity throughout what has been a lengthy and challenging legal process.""","Mohammed Zahid, 65, jailed for 35 years for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.

Heat-related deaths in Spain up 88% from last year: Health ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/heat-related-deaths-in-spain-up-88-from-last-year-health-ministry/articleshow/124323927.cms,"Representative image





MADRID: The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832, an 87.6-percent increase from the same period in 2024, the health ministry said Thursday.Nearly two-thirds of the deaths involved people over the age of 85, and almost 96 percent were over 65, it said in a statement.The figures were estimated using statistical models, the statement said, adding that they may still be revised.The ministry used data from Spain's Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), which tracks daily mortality nationwide and compares it to historical trends.It also incorporates external factors, such as weather data from the national meteorological agency AEMET, to assess likely causes of mortality spikes.Although MoMo cannot confirm a direct cause between deaths and high temperatures, it provides the most reliable estimate of fatalities in which heat was likely a decisive factor.Most heat-related excess deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.The health ministry reported 25 deaths from heatstroke during the same period.Most victims had risk factors such as chronic illnesses, were exposed to high temperatures at work or during leisure activities, or lived alone or in homes without air conditioning, it said.Scientists have warned persistently that human-driven climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense weather events worldwide.Spain this year sweltered through its hottest summer since records began in 1961, with an average temperature of 24.2C, according to AEMET.Of the 90 days of summer, 33 were marked by heatwaves, AEMET said.The country endured a 16-day heatwave in August which fuelled wildfires that killed four people and destroyed a record area of land.That heatwave was ""the most intense on record"", with an average temperature 4.6C higher than average, exceeding the last record set in July 2022.Nine of the 10 hottest summers in Spain since 1961 have occurred in the 21st century, according to AEMET.Britain, Japan and South Korea also endured the hottest summers this year since each country began keeping records, according to their weather agencies.","The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832.

What else do we know about the Pecs Pride march ?





Thousands of people took part in a banned Pride march on Saturday in the university city of Pecs in southwest Hungary.Several thousand people attended in defiance of a police ban on LGBTQ+ rallies.Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power since 2010, has restricted the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in recent years.His ruling ultra-conservative Fidesz party passed a law in March allowing Pride marches to be banned, claiming the move was needed to ""protect children.""Between 7,000 and 8,000 demonstrators had turned out for the rally on Saturday afternoon, according to the French AFP news agency.Several Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including Nicolae Stefanuta from Romania and Tilly Metz from Luxembourg, also joined the rally in a show of solidarity.""I am here today because unfortunately, this demonstration is no longer just about the LGBTQ community but about the restriction of our fundamental human rights,"" 18-year-old student Vencel Toth told AFP.The protesters waved rainbow and EU flags and held signs condemning Orban and his government, accusing it of being a ""dictatorship.""Amnesty International has said the Orban government's ""repressive legislation"" is exerting a ""far-reaching and chilling effect"" on the LGBTQ+ community in the country.The Pride march in Pecs was banned by police on September 6, which was upheld by the Supreme Court a week later. Attendees could face fines of up to €500 ($587).An earlier Pride march held in Budapest this year in June saw more than 200,000 people defy the police ban.","Thousands of people defy police ban on Pride marches in Hungary.

Terrifying! IDF Soldiers STORM Last Gaza Flotilla Ship; Dozens Of Global Activists Arrested At Sea





Switzerland on Friday announced that it will file a diplomatic protest with Israel after Israeli security forces curtailed a visit by Swiss diplomats to detainees from the Gaza aid flotilla.The Swiss foreign ministry in a statement said the visit was interrupted, preventing embassy representatives from speaking at length with the detained Swiss nationals, news agency Reuters reported.Nineteen Swiss citizens were among dozens of activists on a flotilla attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli naval blockade since the October 2023 Hamas attacks.The flotilla was initially intercepted by Israeli forces on Wednesday as it approached Gaza. On Thursday, the activists were taken into custody off Gaza’s coast and subsequently transferred to Ketziot prison, according to the Waves of Freedom flotilla group.Hundreds of other activists, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg were also detained in what was the latest attempt to challenge Israel’s blockade.The Swiss foreign ministry said it would demand immediate and unhindered access to the detained nationals to assess their health and conditions of detention.Swiss representatives spent eight hours at Ketziot prison on Friday and plan to return on Sunday.The flotilla, organized under the Global Sumud, included hundreds of activists from around the world, including Thunberg. Israeli authorities described the mission as a “stunt,” stating the vessels had been warned they were entering an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade.The interception sparked global protests in multiple countries, including Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Colombia, Malaysia, Australia and Bangladesh.Demonstrators demanded justice for the detained activists and showed support for the Greta Thunberg–led operation.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the navy for safely capturing the flotilla participants, confirming that no one was harmed.","Nineteen Swiss citizens were among dozens of activists on a flotilla attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.

President Trump signs executive order establishing White House Task Force for 2026 FIFA World Cup

President Donald Trump on Friday brushed off concerns that ongoing trade tensions between the US, Mexico, and Canada could affect the 2026 FIFA World Cup . Instead, he claimed the disputes would make the tournament “more exciting.”“Tension is a good thing … it makes it much more exciting,” Trump told reporters at the White House, where he met with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to announce the creation of a World Cup task force .Trump signed an executive order establishing the White House task force, which he will chair, to handle security and logistical preparations. “We’re going to make sure everything runs smoothly,” he said.Infantino, said the 2026 World Cup, along with this summer’s FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, would generate 200,000 jobs and have a $40 billion economic impact. “And more than that, we will give joy and happiness to the entire world, and this is priceless, definitely,” he added. “So thank you, Mr President, for setting up this task force, because it is important that everyone that comes to America feels safe, feels welcome, and that's why it's important that the government puts together this White House Task Force.”Despite Trump’s optimism, his trade policies have strained relations with the US's World Cup co-hosts. He has repeatedly threatened tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, unsettling markets. His past remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican leaders have also added to tensions.The 2026 World Cup will be the biggest in history, with 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations. The US will host 78 of those matches, while Mexico and Canada will host 13 each. The final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a White House task force for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Bangladesh interim government must protect minorities: India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-government-must-protect-minorities-india/articleshow/118796757.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Expressing concern about the deteriorating law and order situation in Bangladesh, exacerbated further by the release of violent extremists who were sentenced for serious crimes, the Indian government reiterated Friday that it's the interim government's responsibility to protect Hindus and other minorities. The govt also said it supports a stable, peaceful, inclusive and progressive Bangladesh in which all issues are resolved through democratic means and by holding inclusive and participatory elections.It also urged Dhaka to probe the perpetrators of killings and arson without making any distinction. ""We have repeatedly underlined that it is the responsibility of the interim govt of Bangladesh to protect Hindus and other minorities, as well as their properties and religious institutions,"" said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal.""However, only 1,254 incidents out of over 2,374 incidents reported from Aug 5, 2024 to Feb 16, 2025 have been verified by police. Further, 98% of these 1,254 incidents were deemed 'political in nature'. We expect Bangladesh to thoroughly investigate and bring all perpetrators of killings, arson and violence to justice without making such distinctions,'' he added.But the Indian govt backed development cooperation with Bangladesh, in line with the strong people-to-people ties, even as the security situation blocks progress in implementation of Indian projects. ""Development cooperation is a priority area of our relations with the people of Bangladesh. The recent security situation and long-standing local issues have affected the pace of implementation of some of these projects. The official discussions, therefore, focused on rationalising the project portfolio and executing mutually agreed projects in a time bound manner,"" Jaiswal said.","The Indian government reiterated Friday that it's the interim government's responsibility to protect Hindus and other minorities.

Donald Trump shares bizarre AI-generated video of 'Trump Gaza'

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation endorsed the Arab League's counter-proposal to US President Donald Trump 's plan to seize Gaza and displace its residents, on Friday, according to two ministers who spoke to news agency AFP.""The emergency ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation adopted the Egyptian plan , which has now become an Arab-Islamic plan ,"" Egyptian Foreign minister Badr Abdelatty said.""The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others. This is what we will seek and we have contact with all parties, including the American party."" Abdelatty added.According to the Middle East Monitor, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) had convened an emergency meeting at its Jeddah headquarters to address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the calls for displacement, and the urgent need for Gaza's reconstruction.The Arab-backed proposal, led by Egypt, calls for Hamas to relinquish control to an interim administration until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) assumes governance. Unlike Trump's plan, the Egyptian framework would allow nearly 2 million Palestinians to remain in Gaza.Meanwhile, the Donald Trump-led administration has rejected a long-anticipated Gaza reconstruction plan proposed by Arab leaders, reiterating its own vision for the region.According to CNN, the White House maintains that US President Donald Trump supports a plan that involves expelling Palestinian residents and transforming Gaza into a ""riviera"" under US ownership. In a statement on Tuesday night, White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said, ""The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.""“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza, to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump had told reporters in the first week of February.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after meeting with Trump last month, had praised the proposal as a ""revolutionary, creative vision,"" claiming it had the potential to reshape the region's future. ""For an entire year, we've been told that in the 'day after,' the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Palestinian Authority must be in Gaza,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet.","The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation endorsed the Arab League's counter- proposal to US President Donald Trump's plan to seize Gaza.

Ukraine was once the world’s 3rd largest nuclear power on Earth—here's why it gave them up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ukraine-was-once-the-worlds-3rd-largest-nuclear-power-on-earthheres-why-it-gave-them-up/articleshow/118759795.cms,"Ukraine’s bold decision to give up nuclear weapons

Budapest Memorandum’s security guarantees tested by Russia’s actions



Ukraine’s weakness highlighted after surrendering nuclear arms



Ukraine’s security dilemma amid growing Russian aggression

After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles. The third-largest nuclear power, it inherited around 5,000 nuclear weapons, including intercontinental missiles that could deliver thermonuclear warheads. After having this powerful arsenal, Ukraine took the unprecedented step of relinquishing its nuclear weapons according to the ET reports. This decision, as it determined the fate of the nation, would go on to set the stage for future conflict with Russia.The denuclearization decision of Ukraine was made on the basis of myriad considerations. Although the nation had physically possessed the weapons, it hadn't possessed the control to utilize them. Russia, possessing the launch codes and control systems, possessed control over the weapons. It rendered Ukraine's nuclear arsenal meaningless as a deterrent since they couldn't utilize them by themselves.In addition, having such a large nuclear arsenal was financially unsustainable for the newly independent state of Ukraine, which was only just stabilizing its economy. The financial burden of keeping, securing, and possibly controlling operation of the weapons was too great, and to attempt to do so would have been likely to precipitate a diplomatic crisis with Russia and the West. Geopolitical risks and economic costs dissuaded Ukraine from giving up its nuclear arsenal.In response to international pressure to proliferate nuclear weapons, in 1991 the United States launched the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, funding and technical assistance to enable former Soviet republics to dismantle nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. International pressure to dismantle nuclear stockpiles in former Soviet republics, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, resulted in the creation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program in 1991.Ukraine, despite all this, in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, a significant treaty, in which the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in return for its giving up nuclear weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that these countries would not threaten or use military action against Ukraine and would call for UN action in the case of Ukraine being threatened at any time.Whereas initially the Budapest Memorandum was welcomed as a monumental step toward global nuclear disarmament, assurances laid out in the agreement began to lose legitimacy with shifts in political loyalties. Academics had long advised, nonetheless, that the preservation of nuclear weapons by Ukraine was required to protect from probable Russian attack, since Ukraine being geopolitically situated half-way between Russia and Europe. These concerns increasingly caught momentum since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine dispelled any illusions about the validity of the Budapest Memorandum. While the memorandum was supposed to provide guarantees, Russia's move proved that commitments by nuclear powers can be unilaterally renounced with impunity. Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said there was a two-way failure by Washington and Kyiv to anticipate the ambitions of a rising Russia.The annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine revealed Ukraine's weakness after it had given up its nuclear status. Russia's action proved that international security guarantees, especially those offered by nuclear powers, were not reliable in the presence of aggressive actions by a great power.With the growing Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world observed how Ukraine's sovereignty was targeted head-on by a nuclear nation. Ukraine's countermove came in the form of requesting and accepting Western military aid. It was about high-end weapons and intel sharing, but it left more questions on larger Ukrainian security concerns. The Budapest Memorandum that had provided for protection earlier hadn't managed to deter the violence it was intended to prevent.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian security in an order of the world where nuclear forces are not dependable guarantors of peace. The conflict has caused immense suffering and devastation on the human dimension, posing severe questions about Ukrainian territorial integrity and whether international assurances of security could reasonably deter future aggression.","After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

There’s no kidding, there’s no games with her hair.”The two astronauts, who embarked on what was initially an eight-day mission in June 2024, have remained aboard the ISS for nine months due to technical failures in Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions.Blaming Biden for the delay, Trump asserted, “Biden left them up there… He allowed that to happen to you, but this president won’t let it happen. We’re going to get them out. We’re coming up to get you.” He also suggested the situation was dangerous, saying, “It can have some failures up there. That would be very bad.

Trump organization sues Capital One for closing its accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-organization-sues-capital-one-for-closing-its-accounts/articleshow/118794132.cms,"NEW YORK: President Donald Trump's family business sued Capital One on Friday for ""unjustifiably terminating"" more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them.In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws . The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit.""By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods,"" the company said in a statement.The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said.But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his family's real estate business. The group's lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks.""More to come,"" Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement Friday.The legal action coincides with his father's broader campaign to exact revenge on perceived enemies. Since taking office, the president has revoked the security details of high-profile critics and taken aim at a law firm representing Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him.The lawsuit against Capital One also underscores the Trump Organization's newly emboldened posture now that its owner has reclaimed the White House. After years of shedding properties and halting expansion amid political and legal tumult -- including a tax fraud conviction in New York -- the company has struck a number of new hotel deals in the past year.Many of the deals are based in countries central to U.S. foreign policy, raising potential conflicts for Trump's administration.The president's family business suing a bank that is regulated by his administration could also pose a conflict of interest. The Trump administration last month dropped a lawsuit that accused Capital One of cheating customers out of $2 billion in interest payments on their savings accounts.The new lawsuit might also pose issues for the Trump Organization. If it continues to expand, it might seek loans from major financial institutions. That prospect, however, has not stopped the company from settling a score with one of its longtime banks, which maintained an array of accounts for the group and the Trump family.""Capital One's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,"" the lawsuit said. ""In essence, Capital One 'de-banked' plaintiffs' accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so.""The lawsuit accused the bank of ""unlawful, deceptive and reckless conduct,"" citing supposed violations of consumer protection laws in several states, including New Jersey and North Carolina. The Trump Organization is largely based in Florida.In a statement, a spokesperson for Capital One denied the accusations, saying the bank ""has not and does not close customer accounts for political reasons.""","The Trump Organization accuses Capital One of arbitrarily closing its accounts.

With major crypto investors bankrolling his campaign, Trump is delivering on promises to legitimize the industry—unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, whose administration maintained a hardline stance.Sacks gathered a powerhouse group of industry titans, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Gemini), Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), and Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy), to discuss policies that could propel digital assets forward. The meeting also followed Trump's signing of an executive order establishing a "" Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ""—a bold move aimed at solidifying crypto’s role in the US financial system.The embrace of digital currency isn't just policy—it’s personal. Trump launched his own ""Trump"" memecoin in January, and First Lady Melania Trump followed up with $MELANIA right before the inauguration. He’s also partnered with exchange platform World Liberty Financial, further intertwining his administration with the crypto world.Supporters see Trump’s crypto-friendly stance as a long-overdue move to free the industry from regulatory shackles. Critics, however, warn of speculative risks and potential market instability. While Sacks insisted that the administration’s actions don’t amount to investment advice, he also acknowledged crypto’s volatility: “My job is to create an innovation framework for the United States.”One of the biggest challenges? The rise of memecoins—celebrity-driven tokens that many in the industry see as a credibility risk. Pump-and-dump schemes have left investors burned, and regulatory oversight remains murky.Trump’s crypto push represents a complete reversal from Biden-era crackdowns. The new SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, has already dropped cases against Coinbase and Kraken, while banking restrictions on crypto holdings have been lifted. Sacks slammed the previous administration for treating crypto founders ""like criminals"" without offering clear regulations.Still, shaping those rules will require Congress to step up. With legislation stalled despite intense lobbying, the crypto world is watching closely to see if Trump’s promises translate into lasting change—or if this is just another speculative bet.","Donald Trump hosted top players from the cryptocurrency world at the White House on Friday.

Trump cuts $400 million in grants to Columbia University over alleged failure to protect jewish students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cuts-400-million-in-grants-to-columbia-university-over-alleged-failure-to-protect-jewish-students/articleshow/118794106.cms,"Columbia University's campus in New York

Trump’s warning on campus protests

Columbia under federal scrutiny

The Trump administration on Friday announced the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing the institution’s alleged failure to prevent harassment of Jewish students amid ongoing campus protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza.In a joint statement, four government agencies said the decision was made in response to ""the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students."" The cuts mark the first step in what officials warned could be broader action against the university, which currently receives around $5 billion in federal funding.Earlier this week, Trump vowed to withdraw federal funding from institutions that permit what he called “illegal protests.”In a post on Truth Social, he wrote, “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.” He also threatened harsh consequences for those involved, stating, “Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on ...the crime, arrested.”The decision to defund Columbia follows months of campus unrest, with protests intensifying after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. Demonstrations at Columbia and other universities have sparked accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly as clashes between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students have led to disruptions and, at times, violence.Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended the administration’s move, stating that Jewish students have faced “relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment” since October 7. “Universities must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding,” she said. “For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.”Columbia University has yet to respond to the funding cuts.Meanwhile, the Department of Justice last month launched a multi-agency task force to address anti-Semitism, with its first priority being to investigate and combat harassment on college campuses.","The cuts mark the first step in what officials warned could be broader action against the university.

"JD Vance memes have peaked: How internet turned US Vice President into bloated, grotesque icon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-memes-has-peacked-how-internet-turned-the-vice-president-into-bloated-grotesque-icon/articleshow/118793320.cms,"The JD Vance meme has reached its peak.

The JD Vance meme has reached its peak. Across social media, grotesque, exaggerated images of the US Vice President flood group chats and Discord servers. His face swells, his eyes widen into a vacant, menacing stare, and his chin stretches in unnatural ways. Sometimes, he clutches a giant lollipop. Other times, he mutates into a McNugget, a nuclear explosion, or a decaying Darth Vader. And often, he simply says, “pwease.”Vance’s transformation into an internet spectacle is both a reflection of his public image and a continuation of a long tradition—Vice Presidents as figures of ridicule.Dan Quayle never escaped his infamous “potatoe” misspelling, Al Gore was mocked for his stiffness, and Kamala Harris faced relentless viral clips exaggerating her laughter. But Vance’s meme-ification feels different, more extreme, more surreal.His digital form has evolved. Early memes fixated on his smoky eyes and round cheeks, but the dominant version now is something monstrous. He has become a kind of Cabbage Patch Doll left in the sun, an uncanny, bloated figure that transcends political lines. The bizarre nature of the meme has found traction among conservatives, liberals, and even extremist corners of the internet.The phenomenon echoes the internet’s obsession with Pepe the Frog in 2016. Pepe, once a harmless comic character, morphed into a symbol hijacked by the far right. His “final form,” the Groyper, became an icon for white nationalist figures like Nick Fuentes. Vance’s meme transformation carries some of the same chaotic, shape-shifting energy—an amorphous, ever-expanding in-joke with no clear political allegiance, just a deep undercurrent of derision.Vance, who has long been a target of online ridicule, is no stranger to internet-driven humiliation. His memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, was once the subject of a parody so convincing that mainstream outlets reported a false rumor about him and a couch. The memes now tap into that same instinct: a deep, collective urge to turn Vance into a grotesque caricature, as if mocking him exposes something deeper about his nature.Vance himself has acknowledged the memes, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny. But in the endless cycle of internet culture, his amusement might not last long. Because whether he likes it or not, JD Vance has become something more than just a politician—he’s now a spectacle, a symbol, a meme whose bloated form may never fully deflate.","The JD Vance meme has reached its peak.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the US has pulled out from two more initiatives — a fund for responding to loss and damage and an international climate financing agreement to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels.Though the US under previous President Joe Biden had pledged only $17.5 million for the newly created loss and damage fund , the country’s move to withdraw from it under President Donald Trump would impact the efforts to compensate poor countries for facing the impact of climate change.The Trump administration conveyed its decision to Jean Christophe Donnellier, developed country co-chair of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, on March 4. The fund was created in 2022 and operationalised in 2023.“On behalf of the US department of treasury, I write to inform you that the US is withdrawing from the Board for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, effective immediately,” said Rebecca Lawlor, deputy director at the US Office of Climate and Environment, in an official communication.Making the communication public on X, Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy for Kenya, on Friday expressed his disappointment over the development, saying the spirit of multilateralism should remain the “guiding light” for countries at a time when the world needs a concerted effort to fight the effects of climate change.“The decision by the Trump administration to withdraw from the new fund not only exemplifies a long-standing pattern of obstruction by the US govt in securing necessary finance for addressing climate impacts but also undermines global efforts to deliver climate justice,” said Harjeet Singh, climate activist and expert on the issue of loss and damage.In its second such move, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which was launched during the UN climate talks in 2021. It’s an international climate financing agreement to help developing countries move towards cleaner energy sources.“Big polluters like the US are financially obligated to support climate-vulnerable nations. Indeed, the US exit from the JETP sets a dangerous precedent and signals to the rest of the world that the US will no longer be accountable to its climate obligations,"" said Norly Mercado, Asia regional director of the NGO 350.org.","The US under previous President Joe Biden had pledged only $17.5 million for the newly created loss and damage fund.

Tariffs and inflation loom over economy

Consumer confidence shaken

What’s next?

The US economy added 151,000 jobs in February, falling short of economists’ expectations of 170,000, according to government data released Friday. It marked the first full month under President Donald Trump, offering an early glimpse into how his economic policies are playing out in the labor market ABC news reported.While hiring picked up from January, it remained slightly below last year’s monthly average. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.1%, still near historic lows. Job gains were seen in health care, social assistance, and finance, but the federal government shed 10,000 jobs—a potential result of Trump’s push to shrink bureaucracy.Despite the softer-than-expected report, Wall Street showed little concern. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw early gains on Friday, recovering some ground lost earlier in the week amid market jitters over Trump’s aggressive tariff policies.The jobs report comes during a volatile economic stretch. Trump’s newly imposed tariffs have unsettled investors, with markets plunging Thursday before staging a partial recovery. Though the administration walked back some tariffs, uncertainty remains.Meanwhile, inflation continues to challenge consumers. Prices rose 3% in January compared to a year ago, exceeding the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Egg prices—a closely watched inflation indicator—soared 53% due to bird flu-related supply shortages.A February report from the Conference Board revealed the largest drop in consumer confidence since August 2021, with more Americans fearing a recession. A growing number expect a weaker job market, a falling stock market, and rising interest rates in the coming months.Still, there were bright spots. Mortgage rates have fallen for seven straight weeks, dropping to 6.63% for a 30-year fixed loan—the lowest since December. More Americans are considering home purchases, signaling cautious optimism amid economic uncertainty.With Trump’s policies—including spending cuts, federal job reductions, and tariffs—taking shape, future job reports will be closely watched. The president has made economic growth a key focus, but whether his approach will sustain strong hiring remains an open question.","The US economy added 151,000 jobs in February, falling short of economists’ expectations of 170,000.

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble. The word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan. English was foisted on the Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism. English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118721715,imgsize-61448,width-400,resizemode-4/118721715.jpg"
Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that relations between Bangladesh and India “remain positive”, with no deterioration in bilateral ties , despite “some challenges” arising from “propaganda”.“Some conflicts had been seen mid-way. I would say, some clouds were seen. These clouds mostly came through propaganda. Others will judge the sources,” he said as the interim government in Dhaka is set to complete seven months in office.“We are trying to overcome these misunderstandings. There is no problem in our basic relationship (with India),” Yunus told BBC Bangla in an interview.

That is against the Geneva Convention, and it appears that the police and the security forces failed to ensure that he was made safe. That is an affront to democracy, and an affront to our friends and allies in India,"" he said.""We need to make sure that does not happen again.

France Murder: French man stabs 11-year-old girl to death in rage after losing Fortnite game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-man-stabs-11-year-old-girl-to-death-in-rage-after-losing-fortnite-game/articleshow/118316140.cms,"A man in France has confessed to murdering an 11-year-old girl , claiming he was furious after losing a game of Fortnite, according to French Media.The suspect, identified as 23-year-old unemployed Owen L., told police he was playing the video game when he got into an argument with another player who insulted him. Enraged, he left his home in Epinay-sur-Orge, Essonne, on February 7 to walk off his anger. But what followed was a horrific crime.Prosecutor Grégoire Dulin said Owen initially planned to “rob or extort money from someone to calm down” but instead “accidentally” crossed paths with 11-year-old Louise Lasalle , who was on her way home from school. The suspect noticed her mobile phone, which she wore on a cord around her neck, and decided to follow her.He reportedly tricked Louise into following him into the woods by pretending he had lost something. Once they were alone, he threatened her with a knife, demanding money. When she screamed, he panicked, pushed her to the ground, and stabbed her. Her phone was found beside her body, and there was no sign of sexual assault.Police discovered Louise’s body on February 8, 12 hours after her parents reported her missing. Investigators later found male DNA on her hands.The suspect had also tried to lure another girl into the woods that day, but she refused, French media reported.Owen L. later told his girlfriend that he had “done something serious.” He allegedly disposed of the murder weapon, bleached his clothes, and threw them away. His 24-year-old girlfriend has now been charged with failing to report a crime.The suspect, who lived with his parents, had a criminal record for petty offences. His older sister had also reported him to police in April 2023 for being violent and aggressive.Owen L. is now in police custody , facing charges for the brutal killing.","The suspect, identified as 23-year-old unemployed Owen L., told police he was playing the video game when he got into an argument with another player who insulted him.

Finland's president Sunday urged the rearming of Ukraine and putting ""maximum pressure on Russia"" through sanctions and asset freezes. On the final day of Munich Security Conference, Alexander Stubb and other European leaders sought to plot how the EU can move from talk to more action and stay relevant as Washington pushes to stop war.He laid out three phases: ""pre-negotiation,"" ceasefire and long-term peace negotiation. ""First phase is the pre-negotiation, and this is a moment when we need to rearm Ukraine and put maximum pressure on Russia so that Ukraine begins these negotiations from a position of strength,"" he said. ""I think in Europe we need to talk less and do more.""President Edgars Rinkevics of Latvia, which like Finland borders Russia, agreed that ""if we are strong, if we have something to offer ... then we are going to be interesting to the US.

Cold grips northern US

Tornado in the South

At least nine people have lost their lives as severe weather continues to wreak havoc across the United States. Kentucky has been the hardest hit, with eight fatalities as rising waters swept away cars and homes.US President Donald Trump approved a disaster declaration for Kentucky, allowing federal aid to assist with relief efforts.Governor Andy Beshear confirmed on Sunday that hundreds of people had to be rescued after heavy rainfall caused creeks to overflow, submerging roads and homes.A mother and her seven-year-old child were among those who drowned after their car was caught in floodwaters in Hart County. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in Clay County. In total, four people lost their lives in Hart County alone.The flooding forced the Kentucky River Medical Center in Jackson to close its emergency department and transfer all patients to other hospitals. Authorities posted images on social media showing homes and vehicles completely submerged, while mudslides blocked roads in Virginia and other areas.Beshear reported that over 1,000 rescues had been carried out since the storms began on Saturday. Nearly 39,000 homes lost power, and strong winds threatened to cause further outages.While the South deals with severe flooding, the Northern Plains are facing dangerously low temperatures. An Arctic blast is sending wind chills plunging as low as -50°F (-45.6°C) across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.The national weather service warned of “life-threatening cold” with temperatures expected to drop to -30°F (-34°C) or lower on Monday and Tuesday.The storm system has also made travel difficult. Michigan saw 114 crashes in the Detroit area on Sunday caused by drivers going too fast on icy roads.Avalanche warnings have been issued across the Rocky Mountains, stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with Utah facing the highest risk.Meteorologists say this is the 10th polar vortex event of the season, with Arctic winds forcing frigid air down from the North Pole into the US and Europe. Authorities are urging people to stay off the roads and take precautions to stay safe.In Alabama, an EF-1 tornado struck Hale County overnight, damaging mobile homes, toppling trees, and bringing down power lines. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, a levee in the small town of Rives failed on Saturday afternoon, sending floodwaters rushing into nearby neighbourhoods. A levee is a man-made embankment built along rivers or lakes to prevent flooding.Officials rushed to evacuate residents, while a flash flood warning had been issued for the area just hours before the levee collapsed.In Atlanta, a person was killed when a massive tree crashed onto a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta fire rescue captain Scott Powell.","Kentucky has been the hardest hit, with eight fatalities as rising waters swept away cars and homes.

Final Thoughts

A legal defense fundraiser for Luigi Mangione , the suspect accused in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , has raised $447,378 so far, with a goal of reaching $1,000,000. Organized by The December 4th Legal Committee, the campaign aims to ensure Mangione receives fair legal representation, despite the politically charged nature of the case.Mangione, a 26-year-old Maryland resident, was arrested on December 9 in connection with the case. According to the fundraiser's organizers, they have established contact with both Mangione and his attorney. Funds raised will either go directly to Mangione or, if declined, be redirected to legal defense funds supporting others facing what the group describes as “politicized charges.”The campaign is accepting donations through Tom Dickey Law Offices, P.C., and organizers are encouraging supporters to share the initiative and follow updates via Twitter at @d4legalcomm.Despite coming from a wealthy and well-connected family, Mangione has garnered broad public support, with thousands contributing to his legal defense. His background has not insulated him from the severity of the charges or the intense public scrutiny surrounding the case.Mangione hails from an affluent Maryland family with deep roots in business and finance. His father, Carlo Mangione, is a real estate developer and investor, while his mother, Isabella Mangione, is known for her work in philanthropy and education advocacy. He attended elite private schools growing up and later studied at a prestigious university, where he was active in political and social causes.Despite his privileged upbringing, the outpouring of support for Mangione has come from all walks of life, with backers citing concerns over due process and fairness in the handling of his case. Letters from supporters have flooded Metropolitan Detention Center ( MDC ) in Brooklyn, where he is currently held, with many expressing solidarity regardless of political, racial, or class divisions.Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has launched an official legal defense website. The site, LuigiMangioneInfo.com, was created and is maintained by Mangione’s New York-based legal team to provide updates on his case, address misinformation, and coordinate financial support for his defense.Mangione, who is currently in federal custody in New York while awaiting trial, issued his first public statement through the website. In the message, he expressed deep gratitude for the support he has received since his arrest in early December.""I am overwhelmed by – and grateful for – everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support,"" Mangione wrote. ""Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe. While it is impossible for me to reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive. Thank you again to everyone who took the time to write. I look forward to hearing more in the future.”This marks the first time Mangione has spoken publicly since his arrest and indictment. His defense team has also used the website to outline the purpose behind its creation.According to a statement from his attorneys, the website aims to provide accurate case information and combat misinformation that has circulated in the media.""Due to the extraordinary volume of inquiries and outpouring of support, this site was created and is maintained by Luigi Mangione’s New York legal defense team to provide answers to frequently asked questions, accurate information about his cases, and dispel misinformation. The intent is to share factual information regarding the unprecedented, multiple prosecutions against him,"" the statement reads.Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania in early December 2024 and was later extradited to New York. He faces multiple state and federal charges, including first-degree murder and weapons violations.On December 23, 2024, just before Christmas, he pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court. His legal team is preparing to fight the charges across multiple jurisdictions, with significant upcoming court dates:February 21, 2025 – New York State case, Manhattan Criminal Court (100 Centre St, NY)February 24, 2025 – Pennsylvania State case (Hollidaysburg, PA)March 19, 2025 – Federal case (Southern District of New York, 500 Pearl St, NY)Mangione’s defense is led by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Marc Agnifilo, and Jacob Kaplan of Agnifilo Intrater LLP . Due to the federal nature of the charges, which carry the possibility of the death penalty, Avi Moskowitz of Moskowitz Colson Ginsberg Schulman has been appointed as his lead counsel. In Pennsylvania, he is represented by Thomas Dickey.Since the launch of the website, Mangione’s legal defense fund has gained significant financial support. A crowdfunding campaign hosted on GiveSendGo has raised over $300,000 to cover legal fees and related costs.His defense team has expressed gratitude for the financial and moral support, emphasizing that the funds will play a critical role in ensuring a strong legal defense.Addressing Public Perception and Media MisinformationOne of the primary motivations behind the website’s creation is to counter misleading narratives in the media. Mangione’s defense team argues that the case has been highly politicized and that false reports could negatively impact his right to a fair trial.By providing direct access to court documents and official statements, the site aims to give supporters and the general public an unbiased perspective on the case.With his next court appearances scheduled for late February and March, the legal battle is set to intensify. His attorneys are expected to argue against the severity of the charges and challenge the evidence presented by prosecutors.Meanwhile, the website will continue to serve as a hub for case updates, legal filings, and defense fundraising efforts. Supporters are encouraged to check regularly for new information and to contribute to Mangione’s legal defense if they wish to aid his case.The launch of LuigiMangioneInfo.com marks a major step in Mangione’s legal strategy, signaling a proactive defense campaign aimed at mobilizing public support and financial resources. With multiple legal battles ahead, this platform will likely play a crucial role in shaping public perception and influencing the course of his trial. As the case progresses, it remains to be seen how the defense will navigate the complexities of state and federal charges—and whether Mangione’s claims of wrongful prosecution will gain traction in court.","Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has launched an official legal defense website.

JD Vance’s Greta joke falls flat at Munich Security Conference,"" another user wroteVance, during his speech, launched a scathing critique of European policies, asserting that the greatest threat to democracy in Europe comes from within rather than external adversaries like Russia or China.“There is a new sheriff in town under Donald Trump’s leadership,” Vance declared, reinforcing the administration’s hardline stance on issues such as border security and ideological battles over free speech. Vance’s speech came amid heightened tensions between the United States and European allies over defence spending, trade, and governance.He criticised European leaders for allegedly suppressing dissenting voices, saying, “We may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square. Agree or disagree.”Specifically targeting Germany, which faces elections on February 23, Vance urged European countries to “change course” on immigration. He linked his concerns to a recent attack in Munich, where a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker allegedly rammed a car into a crowd, injuring 36 people.“How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction?” Vance questioned. “An asylum seeker, often a young man in his mid-20s already known to police, rams a car into a crowd and shatters a community.”Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump reacted to Vance's criticism of longstanding US partners.He said that he listened to Vance's remarks. “He talked about freedom of speech. And I think it's true in Europe,” Trump stated. “They're losing their wonderful right of freedom of speech.”The President even claimed that Europe suffers from a “big immigration problem.”",US vice president JD Vance drew flak after he compared Elon Musk with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.

KYIV: A Ukrainian team has arrived in Saudi Arabia for meetings in preparation for a possible visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky, a Ukrainian minister said Sunday, at a time of intense speculation over planned US-Russia talks in the kingdom to end Moscow's war on its neighbour.It also comes as a top US envoy said he and a fellow negotiator appointed by President Trump were heading to Saudi. Ukrainian economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as first deputy PM, didn't clarify whether there is a link between Zelensky's possible trip and the US-Russia talks.

"Elon Musk: 'Utterly callous and dangerous': Hundreds of US nuclear workers fired, then rehired in Donald Trump administration’s sudden U-turn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/utterly-callous-and-dangerous-hundreds-of-us-nuclear-workers-fired-then-rehired-in-trump-administrations-sudden-u-turn/articleshow/118315314.cms,"Hundreds of federal employees working on the United States’ nuclear weapons programmes were abruptly fired—only to have their dismissals reversed within 24 hours in a sudden policy shift by US President Donald Trump 's administration.The move has left workers in confusion and experts warning of national security risks.On Thursday night, up to 350 employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) lost their jobs, according to three U.S. officials who spoke to the Associated Press. Some staff discovered they were fired only when they found themselves locked out of their offices on Friday morning. One of the hardest-hit sites was the Pantex Plant in Texas, which handles the assembly and disassembly of nuclear warheads. Around 30% of the employees dismissed from NNSA were from Pantex, a facility requiring the highest levels of security clearance.The layoffs were part of a broader Department of Energy (DOE) staff purge, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative associated with Elon Musk . Around 2,000 DOE employees were targeted in the cuts. “The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “They don’t seem to realise that it’s actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.”By Friday night, the acting NNSA director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo reinstating all but 28 of the fired workers. “This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025, has been rescinded, effective immediately,” read the memo, obtained by the Associated Press. However, some employees could not be reached after being let go, and others were reconsidering their return due to the uncertainty created by DOGE’s handling of the situation.The DOE first said fewer than 50 NNSA employees were fired, calling them “probationary” staff in administrative roles. However, reports showed many of them had key jobs in nuclear weapons maintenance, waste management, and site security. The affected sites include the Savannah River National Laboratory in South Carolina, the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington—where 177 waste tanks store radioactive material—and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, once a key Manhattan Project site.US Representative Marcy Kaptur and Senator Patty Murray criticised the layoffs as “utterly callous and dangerous.” Experts fear such disruptions could weaken US nuclear security and embolden adversaries. “This is a pivotal moment,” said NNSA deputy division director Rob Plonski. “Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.”","Up to 350 employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) lost their jobs.

The Internet’s Case Against St. Clair’s Claim



The Questions That Will Remain Unanswered—For Now



Was St. Clair really pregnant?

Why hasn’t Musk confirmed or denied outright?

If true, why hide it for five months?

Will this child ever be publicly acknowledged?

There is a school of thought that suggests Elon Musk is in his sixth or seventh simulation—that somewhere along the way, he outplayed the rules of reality and now exists in a realm where he alone dictates the passage of time. He has launched rockets, changed the stock market with a tweet, amassed an empire stretching across electric cars, neural implants, space colonization, and AI, played Diablo while reshaping the US government, fired tens of thousands at a whim, and still found time to repopulate the planet.And now, if Ashley St. Clair is to be believed, father a 13th child in the shadows.The revelation landed on X (formerly Twitter) like a rogue asteroid. A 31-year-old conservative commentator claiming that she and Musk had been quietly raising a child in secret, forced to disclose it due to ""media interference."" But the internet, hardened by years of celebrity rumours, crypto scams, and AI-generated nonsense, did not take her words at face value.The timeline did not align. There were no pregnancy photos, no baby bump sightings, no whispers in the dark corners of tabloids. And then there was Musk’s response—a single word, ""Whoa.""Nothing more.And just like that, a storm began.Ashley St. Clair’s words were clear: Elon Musk is the father of my child. The subtext, however, was muddied by the weight of absence. In a world where every influencer, every pseudo-celebrity, every friend-of-a-friend posts ultrasound scans, hospital wristbands, side-profile baby bump shots, St. Clair had nothing.She said the secrecy was for the child’s protection, but the internet was not convinced. How does a public figure hide something so monumental in an age of constant documentation? There were no whispers, no breadcrumbs, no conveniently blurry TMZ photographs. There was only a void where evidence should have been.Her lawyer, Brian Glicklich, stepped in, stating that Musk and St. Clair had been working on a co-parenting agreement, their negotiations disrupted by prying eyes. But the problem with secrets is that once they see the light, they demand to be scrutinized.Social media sleuths scoured her past posts. What they found was a silence too sharp to ignore. No late-night cravings. No ""Wow, pregnancy is wild"" tweets. Just months of inactivity, followed by a carefully curated return—throwback images from 2017, old political event photos, nothing recent.The internet had questions. Why was Musk silent? Why was there no trail? How did she hide something so seismic?And then there was Musk’s response.If the world expected a statement, they clearly forgot who they were dealing with.Elon Musk does not explain. He drops breadcrumbs and watches as the internet devours itself in speculation. He tweets emojis, vague phrases, jokes that are both meaningless and profound.So when he responded to the controversy with a single word—""Whoa.""—it was both an admission and a refusal.A statement designed to mean everything and nothing at once.Some saw it as an acknowledgment, a quiet nod to a reality he was not yet ready to define. Others saw it as dismissal, Musk treating the gravity of the claim with the same casual detachment as he did a meme about Mars colonization.St. Clair, however, was not amused. If she had expected a carefully worded legal acknowledgment, she forgot that she was dealing with a man who thrives in ambiguity. She fired back, claiming that Musk had ignored her private messages, engaging with online gossip while leaving her unanswered.The storm only grew.If true, this would be Musk’s 13th child, another name added to a lineage that now feels less like a family tree and more like the foundation of an empire.His confirmed children include:Their firstborn, Nevada Alexander Musk , tragically passed away in 2002.Twins Strider and Azure Musk (born 2021).Musk has long spoken about his desire to increase the human population, his belief that declining birth rates are an existential threat. His actions have matched his philosophy. But the question remains—if he is the father of St. Clair’s child, why the secrecy?Or, more importantly, why acknowledge every other child and leave this one to the whispers of speculation?Despite St. Clair’s insistence, the weight of doubt crushes her revelation.First, there is no visible proof—no pregnancy documentation, no baby photos, no doctor’s confirmation. A secret pregnancy is not impossible, but in this era, it is improbable.Second, Musk’s silence is unusual. When his other children were born, he confirmed them—even if reluctantly. This time, there is no clarity.Third, the timing is suspect. The announcement came as Musk’s government restructuring efforts under DOGE resulted in mass layoffs and budget cuts. Was this an organic revelation, or a well-timed distraction?Finally, if there was a private co-parenting agreement, why was it dragged into the public sphere? Was this truly about disclosure, or was it about forcing Musk’s hand?With Musk refusing to clarify, the speculation machine grinds on.Musk, however, seems unbothered. He is reshaping the federal government, restructuring budgets, deleting USAID funds, tweeting cryptic one-liners, and playing video games in between. A potential 13th child is just another footnote in his chaotic existence.St. Clair stands by her claim, but without proof, public opinion fractures—some believe her, others see this as an attempt at relevance, and some simply wait for the next twist in Musk’s ever-unfolding saga.","Ashley St. Clair claimed Elon Musk is the father of her child. But there was no pregnancy photos, no baby bump sightings, no whispers in the dark corners of tabloids.

Trump’s 'saving the country' claim sparks social media meltdown: 'Wannabe dictator',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-saving-the-country-claim-sparks-social-media-meltdown-wannabe-dictator/articleshow/118301034.cms,"Donald Trump has once again ignited a firestorm with a single social media post. Taking to his various social media platforms, Trump declared, ""He who saves his Country does not violate any Law."" The post, which was quickly pinned to the top of his profile, immediately triggered a social media meltdown, with critics branding it the rhetoric of a ""wannabe dictator.""Trump’s statement came amid growing scrutiny over his sweeping executive actions since returning to office, which have reshaped federal agencies, social policies, and international relations. Critics argue that his administration’s mass federal firings, tariff escalations, and legal battles have pushed the limits of executive power. The White House amplified his message by sharing the statement on X.Social media erupted in response, with many seeing the post as a troubling sign of Trump's intentions. “Nothing screams more AUTOCRATIC DICTATOR than ‘He who saves his country does not violate any law,’” one user posted. Another wrote, “Trump just dropped a line straight out of the dictator playbook. That’s Napoleonic-level delusion. Translation? Laws don’t apply to him if he decides he’s ‘saving’ America.”Others warned that the message sought to normalise unchecked power. “If you accept that premise, you’ll stop fighting him, and then he WILL be able to do whatever he wants. Don’t take the bait.”“Imagine Luigi’s lawyer using this tweet as part of his defense,” one person wrote, referring to Luigi Nicholas Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The reference stemmed from Trump’s message seemingly aligning with justifications often used in extreme cases. Another user sarcastically noted, “Donald Trump just said Luigi did nothing wrong.”The debate over Trump's post also extended to constitutional concerns. Critics pointed out that the presidential oath binds the leader to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" not to override laws in the name of national salvation.Meanwhile, Trump’s foreign policy moves have also sparked global unease. His recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to initiate peace talks over Ukraine led to criticism from European leaders, particularly after Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested NATO membership for Ukraine was “not in the cards.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed scepticism, insisting that any peace deal must involve security guarantees for his country.Despite the backlash, Trump's allies have defended his approach. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the administration’s rapid-fire executive actions as “legitimate,” and praised efforts to reshape the federal government. However, some Republican lawmakers have voiced quiet concerns, particularly over Trump’s aggressive deportation policies and sweeping agency cuts.","Donald Trump sparked a firestorm with a single social media post.

Alabama Power: Residents in Alabama left without water after drilling hits aquifer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/residents-in-alabama-left-without-water-after-drilling-hits-aquifer/articleshow/118301170.cms,"Residents in Alabama left without water after drilling hits aquifer

Wells running dry

Shelby County residents blame Alabama Power drilling for dry wells

Uncertain future for the Aquifer

A community in Vandiver, Alabama, is facing a major water crisis after an underground drilling project damaged an aquifer supplying private wells.As reported by AL.com, the issue began when Alabama Power hired a drilling company, REM directional , to install fibre optic cables in Coosa Mountain, located in northern Shelby County.During drilling, the aquifer was struck, causing water to gush from the site. Since then, several residents have been left without a water supply.“They’re not sure it can be fixed, and that’s what scares us all,” said Tommy Fish, one of the affected residents.According to CBS 42, the first signs of trouble appeared in January when residents noticed their wells running dry. Peter Adkins, another resident, consulted a plumber but found no internal plumbing issues. He later visited the drilling site and was informed by a worker that they had observed an unusual amount of water flowing back during the process.Currently, eight wells belonging to five homeowners are completely dry, while others are experiencing a significant drop in water levels. Many residents rely entirely on private wells as they are too far from municipal water connections.Last week, a lawsuit was filed by three residents, including Fish, to halt the drilling. Shelby County Circuit court judge Patrick Kennedy initially issued a temporary restraining order.However, as per AL.com, the judge later ruled that drilling must continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to complete the project as quickly as possible.The court also instructed Alabama Power to provide daily status reports and assist affected residents by supplying water and other necessities.Fish and other residents worry about the long-term impact on the aquifer and their homes. “As the water table continues to lower, it will affect more people,” he said.Attorney Bruce Romeo, representing the affected homeowners, told WVTM 13 that there is no guarantee the aquifer can be restored. He also raised concerns that the depletion of the aquifer could lead to ground instability, which might affect housing structures.“Losing the aquifer could destabilise the ground, which could in turn jeopardise people’s homes,” Fish warned.Alabama Power stated that completing the project swiftly is the best course of action to assess and resolve the issue. “Upon completion, we can fully assess any impacted wells and promptly resolve the matter,” said spokesperson Alyson Tucker.With another court hearing scheduled for 18 February, residents remain anxious about the future of their water supply.","Alabama Power hired a drilling company to install fibre optic cables in Coosa Mountain, located in northern Shelby County. During drilling, the aquifer was struck, causing water to gush from the site. Since then, several residents have been left without a water supply. Alabama Power stated that completing the project swiftly is the best course of action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118301353,imgsize-1748505,width-400,resizemode-4/118301353.jpg"

For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

BALOCHISTAN: Paank, the human rights department of the Baloch National Movement , has raised concerns regarding the forcible disappearance of 11 individuals from Pasni, Balochistan , between February 8 and February 10.Paank further said that these individuals have allegedly been abducted and unlawfully detained by Pakistan security forces.""Paank is deeply concerned by the enforced disappearances of 11 individuals from Pasni, #Balochistan, between February 8 and February 10, 2025. Reports indicate that Pakistani security forces have unlawfully detained and forcibly disappeared these individuals, continuing a pattern of human rights violations in the region,"" Paank wrote on X.It added, ""On February 8, 2025, two brothers, Naseem and Washdil, sons of Pathan, were taken from the Chakuli Kulanch region of Gwadar. Their disappearance raises serious concerns about the systematic targeting of civilians, especially those involved in public discourse, as Naseem Pathan was known for maintaining the Facebook page Chakuli Musam, which provides weather updates.""The post further mentioned, ""On February 10, 2025, nine more individuals were forcibly disappeared from Pasni's Ward No 6, Ward No 5, and Ward No 3, following illegal detentions by Pakistani forces- Maqbool Akram (Ward No 6), Saleem Raza (Ward No 6), Naseeb Suwali (Ward No 6), Fasail Suwali (Ward No 6), Sajid Suwali (Ward No 6), Ali Baloch (Ward No 5), Ahmed Raza (Ward No 6) and Saleh Riaz (Ward No 3).""Paank through their post urges the Pakistani government to promptly free all those who have been forcibly disappeared and vehemently condemns these acts.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

DHAKA: The foreign ministry of Bangladesh on Thursday said the Yunus government will send a ""formal reminder"" to India regarding the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina when it deems the timing is appropriate. ""It (the reminder) will be sent when the political leadership feels it is the right time,"" ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters. Pressed for details, he emphasised that the matter involves both political considerations and diplomatic procedures .Alam confirmed that Bangladesh had formally requested Hasina's extradition in Dec, submitting a set of relevant documents along with a diplomatic letter (note verbale) to India.On whether Bangladesh had provided an arrest warrant to facilitate the extradition, Alam said all required materials, received from the relevant ministries, had been included in the note verbale. When asked about the timing of a possible reminder to India, Alam reiterated that it would be a ""diplomatic and political decision"" and that govt would proceed accordingly. Alam said despite Bangladesh's formal request, India is yet to respond. ""We continue to expect a response from New Delhi ,"" he said.India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has confirmed that New Delhi received Bangladesh's extradition request. Hasina faces over 100 charges, including allegations of murder, genocide, and crimes against humanity related to killings during the July uprising that led to her fleeing to India on August 5.","The Yunus government will send a ""formal reminder"" to India regarding the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina when it deems the timing is appropriate.

Taliban's security challenges

One killed and three others suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing on Thursday.""The suicide attacker wanted to enter the ministry and one of the mujahideen (security forces) shot him and then in the result of the explosion another person near him was killed and three injured,"" interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.Although violence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021, the Islamic State (IS) group continues to launch deadly attacks challenging their rule. IS has previously targeted Taliban officials, foreign diplomats, and civilians in Afghanistan.A doctor at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, speaking anonymously, said that ""five to six injured"" individuals had been brought to the facility for treatment. However, official casualty figures often differ from those reported by medical personnel on the ground.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack, but IS has a history of carrying out high-profile bombings in Afghanistan. In December, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban government's minister for refugees, inside his Kabul office. Just a day before Thursday's attack, IS also claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on a northern Afghan bank, which left eight people dead. The attack specifically targeted Taliban employees collecting their salaries.IS-Khorasan, the Afghan chapter of the Islamic State founded in 2015, has been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country. The group gained global attention in August 2021 when it bombed Kabul airport during the chaotic US evacuation, killing around 170 Afghans and 13 American service members.Since taking power, the Taliban government has declared security its highest priority, claiming success in curbing IS activities through an extensive crackdown. However, IS remains a persistent threat, continuing to target government officials and civilians alike.Security forces frequently seal off attack sites, making independent verification of casualty figures difficult. The Taliban maintains that its counterterrorism measures have weakened IS, but Thursday's bombing highlights the ongoing security challenges the administration faces.","One killed and three others injured in suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing.

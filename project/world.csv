What is happening in Syria?



US military forces conducted aerial operations against Islamic State positions in Syria on Sunday, targeting more than 75 strategic locations. The operation involved multiple aircraft types from the US Air Force fleet.In a statement, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) forces said that the strikes were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat Isis, to prevent them from conducting external operations. This is also done to prevent Isis to take the advantage of the current situation in Syria.""The operation struck over 75 targets using multiple U.S. Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s.Battle damage assessments are underway, and there are no indications of civilian casualties,"" the statement read.""CENTCOM, together with allies and partners in the region, will continue to carry out operations to degrade Isis operational capabilities even during this dynamic period in Syria,"" it added.General Michael Erik Kurilla after the operation said that they will never allow Isis to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria.""All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if they partner with or support Isis in any way,"" he added.US President Joe Biden called the sudden collapse of Bashar Assad ’s regime in Syria a “fundamental act of justice” on Sunday, claiming the country was suffering under Assad and his family.However, he cautioned that this was also “a moment of risk and uncertainty” for the Middle East.Biden addressed the nation from the White House just hours after rebel groups completed their takeover of Syria, marking the end of over a decade of violent civil war. The president confirmed that the United States was closely monitoring reports suggesting that Assad, whose whereabouts remain unknown with reports indicating that he has taken refuge in Russia.Biden credited the efforts of the United States and its allies in undermining Assad’s backers, including Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,” Biden said while emphasising that the allies could no longer support Assad’s grip on power.Biden claimed that the Assad regime was responsible for the deaths, torture, and brutality against numerous Syrian civilians during the past fifty years. He further went to say that the end of the government now presents a significant chance for Syria's population to rebuild.""After 13 years of civil war in Syria and more than half a century of brutal authoritarian rule by Bashar Assad and his father before him, rebel forces have forced Assad to resign his office and flee the country. We're not sure where he is, but there's word that he's in Moscow. At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,"" Biden said.""This regime brutalised, tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country,"" he added.Syrian rebels announced they had taken full control of the crucial city of Homs early on Sunday after just one day of fighting, further threatening President Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule as insurgents advanced on the capital, Damascus.As the army withdrew, thousands of Homs residents filled the streets, celebrating with chants of ""Assad is gone, Homs is free"" and ""Long live Syria, down with Bashar al-Assad.""Rebels fired into the air in triumph, while youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, marking a dramatic week-long collapse of Assad's territorial control.","US military forces conducted aerial operations against Islamic State positions in Syria on Sunday, targeting more than 75 strategic locations.

Steps into spotlight

'Assad Defeated': Rebels Declare 'Syria Is Free' In Damascus; Syrian PM Addresses Nation

'Smart thing to do'



Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS ), who stepped into the spotlight after his Islamist alliance led a decisive offensive that rebels claim has toppled President Bashar al-Assad , ending five decades of Baath Party rule in Syria.Jolani, whose real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa, has a controversial past. His group, rooted in Syria’s branch of Al-Qaeda, has been accused of extremist activities. However, he has recently adopted a more moderate image while leading the fight to oust Assad.On Sunday, as rebels entered Damascus, Jolani ordered fighters to stay away from public institutions to maintain order.Earlier this week, he had stated the primary goal of the campaign: “to overthrow Assad.” Thirteen years after Assad’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests sparked Syria’s civil war, the rebels announced that Assad had fled the country, declaring Damascus free of the ""tyrant.""Once known for operating from the shadows, Jolani has now taken a public role. During the offensive, he appeared in Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, after it was captured by rebels for the first time in the war.He has stopped wearing the traditional turban often linked to jihadists and now opted for military fatigues and a khaki shirt, presenting himself as more practical and adaptable.During a visit to Aleppo’s citadel last Wednesday, Jolani was seen waving to crowds, a stark contrast to his earlier reclusive persona. He also began signing statements under his real name, a shift interpreted by some as an attempt to align himself with his roots and distance himself from his militant past.Born in 1982 to a well-off family in Damascus’ Mazzeh district, Jolani’s path to jihadism reportedly began after the September 11, 2001 attacks. According to the Middle East Eye, he was inspired by the attackers and began attending secret sermons in Damascus. He later joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq and was detained for five years before returning to Syria in 2011 to found the Al-Nusra Front , Al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch.Jolani broke ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016, a move he claimed was meant to prevent Western retaliation. Despite this, HTS remains classified as a terrorist organization by Western governments.Jolani’s leadership has drawn mixed views. Some see him as pragmatic, while others view him as an opportunist. “In 2014, he was at the height of his radicalism,” said Thomas Pierret, an expert on political Islam. “Since then, he has moderated his rhetoric.”Under his leadership, HTS consolidated power in Idlib province by merging with rival Islamist groups in 2017. The group established a civilian government in the region, often accused of brutal crackdowns on dissent. The UN has classified some of HTS’s actions as war crimes.Despite his past, Jolani has sought to reassure residents of newly “liberated” areas, including Aleppo, which is home to a significant Christian minority. Speaking to residents, he promised no harm would come to them under his administration. He also urged his fighters to maintain security in captured areas.""I think it's primarily just good politics,"" said Aron, a fellow at the Century International think tank. ""The less local and international panic you have and the more Jolani seems like a responsible actor instead of a toxic jihadi extremist, the easier his job will become. Is it totally sincere? Surely not,"" he added. ""But it's the smart thing to say and do right now.""","Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS) His Islamist alliance led a decisive offensive that rebels claim has toppled President Bashar al-Assad.

Harry Meghan Divorce: Prince Harry was forced to dismiss Meghan Markle divorce rumors because...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-was-forced-to-dismiss-meghan-markle-divorce-rumors-because-/articleshow/116056338.cms,"Prince Harry's statement on divorce rumors appeared forced, experts said.

Though Prince Harry dismissed rumors of divorce from Meghan Markle and made light of the rumour miles as he said that apparently they are divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well, the statement according to experts is a forced one aiming to pivot the future of their joint brand. Meghan and Harry parted ways professionally and do not stay with each other mostly as they want to pursue separate professional paths since their joint venture flopped.Royal expert Sarah Louise-Robertson said Harry was forced to issue the statement because they saw a chance to garner positivity for teh Sussex brand as their relationship is being so much discussed. ""Meghan clearly reads social media comments that people say about them. As does Harry, who is notoriously brittle and thin-skinned. So some things got through to them and they’ve decided, ‘right, we’re going to try this new approach,"" Sarah said on GB News.“When you’ve been away from each other as much as they’ve been, this is how these [divorce] rumours start.”The statement looked forced as Harry was not directly asked about the divorce rumours; he was asked about exceeding interest in them. But Harry took the opportunity and mentioned divorce so that the buzz goes on.“Is that normal for you? The second there’s an article — she’s in California, you’re in New York — they say, ‘Well, what is happening with these two, right?’ Is that a good thing for you, in a way, that there’s so much interest in you?” Harry was asked.""No, that's definitely not a good thing. Apparently, we’ve bought or moved house 10, 12 times. We’ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it’s just like, what?"" Harry said with a laugh. Then he spoke how he grew up in an atmosphere like that with maddening interest in his mother Diana's life.""I’ve seen stories written about myself that aren’t exactly based on reality. I’ve seen stories about members of my family, friends, strangers, all sorts of people,"" Harry said.",Royal expert Sarah Louise-Robertson said Harry was forced to issue the statement because they saw a chance to garner positivity for teh Sussex brand.

The HTS, despite its origins in al-Qaida, claims to have severed ties with the organization.The alliance between HTS and the Syrian National Army is potentially fragile. The Turkish-backed groups want a buffer zone near Turkey's border, and Turkey, while previously supporting anti-Assad fighters, has recently pushed for reconciliation and denies involvement in the current offensive. The future cooperation of these groups remains uncertain.Simultaneously, other opposition groups have mobilized. Local forces have taken control in Sweida, home to Syria's Druze minority, and Daraa, a Sunni Muslim area and a center of the 2011 uprising. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed Kurdish-led group, control much of eastern Syria.

The fall of Damascus

A mysterious flight

Speculations and theories

A leadership in limbo

Damascus is no longer under the control of Bashar al-Assad , as rebels staged a sudden advance and seized the Syrian capital, marking the end of Assad’s 24-year reign. Early Sunday, two senior army officers reported that Assad boarded a plane from Damascus, heading to an undisclosed location, fueling speculation about his fate.The rebel offensive, which began a week ago with the surprise capture of northern Aleppo, quickly snowballed. Cities fell one after another as Assad’s forces were unable to hold their ground. The takeover of Homs , a strategic central city, severed Damascus from the Alawite-dominated coastal region, where Assad’s Russian allies maintain air and naval bases.Assad has not made a public appearance since the rebel advance began. The Syrian leader’s wife, Asma, and their two children are also unaccounted for.Around the time the rebels reportedly captured Damascus, a Syrian Air plane took off from the city’s airport, according to Flightradar24 , a flight tracking service. Initially heading toward Syria’s coastal region, the aircraft made a sudden U-turn and flew in the opposite direction before vanishing from radar.Two Syrian sources speculated that the plane might have been downed. “It disappeared off the radar, possibly the transponder was switched off, but I believe the bigger probability is that the aircraft was taken down,” said one source, declining to elaborate further.The rebels' swift advance has sparked rumors about Assad’s possible escape. Some believe he might seek asylum in Moscow or Tehran, his key allies. However, conflicting reports have muddied the waters.Syrian state media, as of Saturday, insisted that Assad was still in Damascus. Iranian news agencies also released a photograph purportedly showing Assad meeting a top Iranian official in Damascus. Yet, as rebels closed in, state media fell silent.The sole trackable flight leaving Syria after midnight was a commercial plane heading to the UAE, hours after Homs fell. Whether Assad and his family were on board remains unconfirmed.The sudden collapse of Assad’s government has left Syria’s political future uncertain. While celebrations erupted in rebel-held areas, the fate of Assad, a central figure in Syria’s decade-long civil war, remains shrouded in mystery.For now, all eyes are on the radar screens and international channels for any sign of the ousted president’s whereabouts. As one Syrian official grimly noted, “If he was on that plane, the probability of him being alive is slim.”","Bashar al-Assad has not made a public appearance since the rebel advance began.

The murder weapon is believed to be a veterinary firearm typically used for euthanising farm animals, requiring reloading after each shot.The bullet casings bore written words: ""Depose,"" ""Delay,"" and ""Deny"", apparently referencing the 2010 publication ""Delay, Deny, Defend"" which criticised the health insurance sector.Thompson was fatally shot on Wednesday outside an upmarket Midtown hotel in what police described as a ""brazen, targeted attack"". Security footage captured the entire incident, showing the assailant firing three shots into Thompson's back as he walked towards an insurance conference.Authorities indicate the suspect travelled from Atlanta via Greyhound bus before the incident. The investigation trail suggests the suspect later entered the Port Authority bus terminal near 178th Street, potentially leaving New York City.At a Police Athletic League holiday celebration in Harlem, Mayor Adams stated ""The net is tightening"" but declined to reveal whether the suspect's identity was known to investigators.

Can US President-elect Donald Trump eliminate birthright citizenship? Legal experts answer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-us-president-elect-donald-trump-eliminate-birthright-citizenship-here-are-the-details/articleshow/116119716.cms,"What is Amendment 14?



Legal experts suggest road not easy for Trump



US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to eliminate birthright citizenship at the start of his potential second term, although it won't be easy for him, experts indicate.During a televised discussion on NBC's "" Meet the Press "", when questioned about his plans regarding birthright citizenship - which grants citizenship to those born in the US - Trump indicated the need for change. ""Absolutely,"" he responded.When queried about navigating around the 14th Amendment , he suggested consulting the public, Fox5 reported.Contrary to Trump's assertion, the US is not unique in offering birthright citizenship. Both the US and Canada, among G7 nations, provide this right, with several other nations offering variations of it.This proposal isn't novel for Trump, who previously suggested it in 2018. He mentioned that whilst intending to address this during his first term, the COVID-19 crisis took priority.The 14th Amendment, established post-Civil War to ensure citizenship for freed slaves, states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""It further includes crucial due process and equal protection clauses: ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""Legal experts, including the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project director, indicate that altering birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, necessitating significant congressional support and state ratification, as per Fox5.Geoffrey Hoffman from the University of Houston Law Center explains that arguments against birthright citizenship based on jurisdiction interpretation are invalid, as all non-diplomatic persons in the US are subject to its laws regardless of immigration status.Any presidential executive order attempting to modify this right would face legal challenges and potentially violate multiple constitutional provisions, including Article 2 and laws regarding denaturalisation.","Legal experts suggest road not easy for Trump to change 14th Amendment.

The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has intensified public scrutiny of health insurance companies, bringing national attention to their business practices.Allegations of companies ""delay, deny and defend"" claims have reignited debates on the challenges patients and doctors face when navigating insurance systems.Health insurers often operate within the frameworks set by employers or government entities that hire them to manage healthcare funds.According to Forbes, insurers derive profits partly from what remains in the pool of premiums paid by employers, workers, taxpayers, and consumers. They are also compensated via administrative fees by self-insured employers and governments for managing these funds.Decisions on coverage and costs are typically made in collaboration with employers or, in the case of state-funded Medicaid, lawmakers and governors.Most US states have transitioned to privatised Medicaid programs managed by companies like UnitedHealthcare, Centene, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield. For Medicare, the federal government has similarly shifted toward private insurers via Medicare Advantage plans, Forbes reported.Medicare Advantage, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, has become more popular than government-run Medicare, with over half of eligible Americans opting for these plans. However, industry rules requiring prior authorisations for treatments have faced criticism. The American Medical Association cited data from KFF, noting that 7.4 per cent of all prior authorisations were denied or partially denied in 2022—an increase from under 6 per cent annually between 2019 and 2021.Private insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has also seen record enrollment due to enhanced subsidies under President Joe Biden’s administration. However, the uncertainty looming over these subsidies is set to expire in 2025, according to Forbes.The Trump administration, if re-elected, could reduce industry regulations, potentially leading to coverage losses for millions.The Commonwealth Fund warns that if subsidies expire, premiums could spike, causing coverage losses for approximately 4 million people.The outlet further added that Trump’s previous efforts to repeal the ACA included proposals that could have resulted in over 50 million uninsured individuals and restrictions for those with preexisting conditions.","Health insurers often operate within the frameworks set by employers or government entities that hire them to manage healthcare funds.

FDA considers banning controversial red food dye linked to health risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fda-considers-banning-controversial-red-food-dye-linked-to-health-risks/articleshow/116115644.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purpose only.

Concerns about health risks

Growing push for change

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is contemplating banning Red 3, a synthetic food dye used in over 3,000 products, including popular snacks like Pez, Peeps, and Betty Crocker items.Known chemically as erythrosine and derived from petroleum, Red 3 adds a bright cherry-red hue to foods but offers no nutritional value. Public health concerns surrounding the dye have mounted, citing its potential links to cancer and behavioural issues in children.Speaking before the Senate Health Committee on Thursday, Jim Jones, FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, confirmed, “With Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorisation board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks, we’ll be acting on that petition.”The move follows California’s decision last year to ban four food dyes, including Red 3, and comes amidst increasing pressure to align US regulations with stricter European Union standards.Red 3 has been banned from cosmetics since 1990 due to its carcinogenic effects in animal tests, a decision made under the 1960 Delaney Clause, which prohibits deeming a colour additive safe if it causes cancer in humans or animals. Despite this, the dye remains authorised in food.“There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the colour of their food so it looks more appealing,” said Frank Pallone Jr, a Democrat and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a letter to the FDA, reported The Guardian.While the FDA insists its approved dyes are safe when consumed as directed, studies highlight concerning impacts.A 2021 California review linked synthetic food dyes to hyperactivity and neurobehavioral problems in children, revealing sensitivity varies among individuals. “The evidence now shows pretty conclusively that when some kids eat these, they will experience nervous system effects that look like ADHD,” said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, as per NBC News.Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, criticised the FDA’s laxity, stating: “There are some departments such as the nutrition departments in the FDA that have to go, that are not doing their job, they are not protecting our kids.”European countries already require warning labels or ban certain dyes altogether, employing a precautionary approach to consumer safety.The FDA’s impending decision could set a significant precedent, influencing how the US addresses other synthetic additives in the food supply.Pallone added: “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.”","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is contemplating banning Red 3, a synthetic food dye used in over 3,000 products, including popular snacks like Pez, Peeps, and Betty Crocker items.

Austin Tice

’s family renews hope

US President Joe Biden called the sudden collapse of Bashar Assad ’s regime in Syria a “fundamental act of justice” on Sunday, claiming the country was suffering under Assad and his family.However, he cautioned that this was also “a moment of risk and uncertainty” for the Middle East.Biden addressed the nation from the White House just hours after rebel groups completed their takeover of Syria, marking the end of over a decade of violent civil war. The president confirmed that the United States was closely monitoring reports suggesting that Assad, whose whereabouts remain unknown with reports indicating that he has taken refuge in Russia.Biden credited the efforts of the United States and its allies in undermining Assad’s backers, including Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,” Biden said while emphasising that the allies could no longer support Assad’s grip on power.Biden claimed that the Assad regime was responsible for the deaths, torture, and brutality against numerous Syrian civilians during the past fifty years. He further went to say that the end of the government now presents a significant chance for Syria's population to rebuild.""After 13 years of civil war in Syria and more than half a century of brutal authoritarian rule by Bashar Assad and his father before him, rebel forces have forced Assad to resign his office and flee the country. We're not sure where he is, but there's word that he's in Moscow. At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,"" Biden said.""This regime brutalised, tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country,"" he added.The Syrian opposition group that overthrew Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham , has a controversial history. Designated as a terrorist organisation by the Biden administration for its alleged ties to al-Qaida, the group has since claimed it severed those links.Acknowledging this complex scenario, Biden remarked, “Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses. But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions.”Biden confirmed that the United States would maintain its troop presence in Syria, primarily in opposition-held areas in the northeast, to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State. He revealed that US forces conducted “dozens” of precision air strikes on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria on Sunday.“We will remain vigilant,” Biden said. “We believe that our continued presence is essential to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.”The United States maintains a military presence in Syria, with about 900 troops focusing on preventing an Islamic State resurgence. Daniel B Shapiro, deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, clarified that the American military presence was solely aimed at defeating ISIS and was not connected to the broader conflict.The fall of Assad’s regime has reignited calls for the safe return of missing US journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in 2012 near Damascus. Biden assured the Tice family of his administration’s commitment to finding him.“We believe he’s alive, we think we can get him back but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable,” Biden stated. He added, “We have to identify where he is.”","Biden addressed the nation from the White House just hours after rebel groups completed their takeover of Syria.

Hegseth’s controversies under scrutiny

Republican Senators

weigh in

Challenges ahead for Hegseth

Republican Senator Joni Ernst has voiced significant reservations about President-elect Donald Trump ’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , citing the need for further clarity on critical issues.Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday, Ernst stated she needed more information about Hegseth's views and plans before deciding whether to support his nomination.Senator Ernst is a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and a combat veteran.Accordint to the news agency AP, Ernst said, “As a survivor of sexual assault, I have worked heavily on measures to improve how such cases are handled within the military”.“I’d like to hear more about his stance on this and the role of women in combat”, she added.Hegseth, a former “Fox & Friends” host and infantry combat veteran, faces allegations of excessive drinking and a 2017 sexual assault accusation, which he denies. The allegations have raised questions about his suitability to lead the Pentagon, particularly since he has no prior leadership experience within the department.Responding to these claims, Hegseth stated on Megyn Kelly’s ‘SiriusXM’ show that the assault accusation was a ""really unfortunate situation,"" claiming he settled to avoid potential fallout on his career at Fox News.Despite these controversies, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have defended Hegseth, describing him as highly capable. Trump remarked in an interview with NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ that “Pete is doing well now,” expressing confidence in his confirmation.Ernst is not alone in her cautious approach. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) are among those yet to be convinced, while Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) has emphasised the importance of a public hearing.According to AP, Fischer noted that such a process would provide transparency, allowing the American public to witness both the questioning and Hegseth’s responses.As per Politico, Ernst also raised concerns about Hegseth’s views on women in combat, referencing his comments that women “straight up” should not serve in such roles. Additionally, Ernst highlighted the importance of financial management within the Department of Defense, which oversees a vast $877 billion budget.Hegseth faces a difficult path to confirmation. He has been meeting with Republican senators, including potential swing voters, in an effort to garner support. However, the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the allegations against him could significantly impact his prospects.Senator Angus King (I-Maine) expressed concerns about the pressure being placed on Republican senators to support Hegseth, cautioning against political interference in the vetting process. “I don’t want someone compromised by actions from the past that could jeopardise their ability to do the job,” King stated.As Ernst and other senators await further clarification, Hegseth is expected to face rigorous questioning during his confirmation hearing, a process Ernst described as “incredibly important for transparency and fairness.”","Republican Senator Joni Ernst has voiced significant reservations about President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth.

Photographer Hannah Kobayashi’s disappearance and her subsequent appearance in Mexico have baffled investigators, with recent revelations shedding light on her final hours in Los Angeles.According to the New York Post, she spent nine hours with an unidentified man before vanishing.The pair reportedly met on November 11 near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and quickly formed a bond. Walking together through downtown LA, they eventually reached Union Station , where they shared dinner and fell asleep in a waiting area.The man, later tracked down by authorities, claimed he awoke the next morning to find Kobayashi gone, as reported by The Mirror.Law enforcement initially focused on the man, who appeared to be the last person to see Kobayashi before her disappearance.Lieutenant Doug Oldfield of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit told the People, “For a while, he was the last person to have seen her when we didn’t know where she was. So we did have to spend a few days on this to ensure that nothing bad happened.”After analysing security footage, police corroborated his account and found no signs of foul play.Detective Omar Franco described the man as a “listener,” explaining that Kobayashi spoke about her life in Maui, her personal struggles, and her missed plans to visit New York.“She just spoke about her life … and he just listened,” People quotes Franco.Police confirmed that Kobayashi left Union Station alone, purchased a bus ticket at 6.10 am (local time) on November 12, and crossed the border into Tijuana by noon. Her phone was left behind at LAX for reasons still unclear.Authorities revealed no evidence of a crime and have suspended their investigation since Kobayashi’s journey to Mexico was voluntary, according to The Mirror.Speculation about Kobayashi’s disappearance deepened with reports of a possible marriage scam.According to Los Angeles Magazine, Kobayashi allegedly married an Argentinian man, Alan Cacace , in what might have been a green card scheme . Her mother, Brandi Yee, reportedly found immigration documents in Kobayashi’s Hawaii home, suggesting she was working with an immigration attorney.Amid these revelations, family tensions have erupted. Kobayashi’s sister Sydni accused their aunt Larie Pidgeon of overstepping in providing public updates about the case.In response, Pidgeon told The Post: “Sydni is throwing me under the bus because she wants the limelight of national TV interviews.”The mystery surrounding Kobayashi’s disappearance and the strain within her family remain unresolved, even as her journey to Mexico raises more questions than answers.",Photographer Hannah Kobayashi disappeared in Los Angeles on November 11.

Speculation intensifies over Jill Biden's perceived support

Netizens react

A rare bipartisan interaction stole the spotlight during the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, as President-elect Donald Trump and outgoing First Lady Jill Biden shared a warm exchange. The moment, captured on camera, has since gone viral, delighting Trump supporters and igniting a wave of speculation online.During Saturday's ceremony, Jill Biden and Donald Trump were seated near each other, separated only by French First Lady Brigitte Macron .As they waited for her to take her seat, cameras caught the two engaged in what appeared to be a friendly conversation.While the contents of their exchange remain unknown, social media users speculated that Jill Biden, despite her husband’s long-standing rivalry with Trump, may have softened towards the President-elect.Rumours about Jill Biden’s stance toward Trump have circulated since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race in July. MAGA supporters highlighted moments like President Biden wearing a Trump hat during an event with firefighters last September and Jill Biden sporting a bold red outfit on Election Day as signs of their alleged covert support for Trump.Adding fuel to the fire, Joe Biden appeared uncharacteristically cheerful when acknowledging Trump’s victory after the November election, further feeding online theories that the Bidens may not have fully backed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.Jill Biden, meanwhile, was on her final foreign trip as First Lady, joined by her daughter Ashley Biden. Social media exploded with commentary on the viral images of Jill and Trump, with users joking about their apparent camaraderie.One user wrote, “Looks like they’re having a good time.”Another quipped, “They totally voted for him🤣”Netizens also used sarcasm about Jill’s wearing the red dress on Election Day. “… yeah, so that red suit I wore wasn’t an accident…”, wrote one user.“Jill and Ashley Biden look like they’re absolutely in love with President Trump 🤣”, wrote a user.Meanwhile, one commented, “Find someone who looks at you the way Jill Biden looks at Trump.”The Notre Dame reopening marked Trump’s first overseas visit since his November 5 election victory. While in Paris, he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the UK’s Prince William.Elon Musk, his close ally and billionaire entrepreneur, was also accompanying him.","Jill Biden and Donald Trump were seated near each other at Notre Dame reopening.

Mayor and FBI ramp up efforts

Internet backlash against the health insurance industry

The search for the gunman who murdered UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson has intensified, with law enforcement expanding efforts to locate the suspect. The New York Police Department (NYPD) released fresh images late Saturday showing the man in the back of a taxi, reportedly fleeing the scene.The nationwide manhunt is now in its fifth day.According to Fox News, investigators recovered a backpack believed to belong to the suspect in Central Park. The bag contained a jacket and Monopoly money, but no firearm.A retired FBI agent explained that the backpack would undergo forensic testing for potential DNA evidence, particularly from areas such as straps and zippers.Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot Wednesday morning outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, just before he was due to speak at an investment conference. Surveillance footage captured the shooter, disguised in a hooded jacket, balaclava, and grey backpack, firing multiple times at close range at approximately 6.45 am (local time).The suspect fled on an electric bike through Central Park, exiting near 77th Street shortly after the attack.Chief of detectives Joseph Kenny provided a detailed timeline, noting that the suspect was seen entering a taxi near 86th Street at 7.04 am (local time). Police believe he was dropped off at Port Authority bus terminal and left New York City soon after.The station's routes connect to destinations including New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC.As reported by USA Today, the NYPD revealed the suspect had arrived in New York on November 24 aboard a bus from Atlanta. Investigators found the words “delay,” “depose,” and “deny” written on bullet casings at the crime scene, although no motive has been determined.Mayor Eric Adams stated Saturday that the ""net was tightening"" in the search but declined to confirm whether the suspect's identity had been established. ""We don’t want to release that now,"" Adams remarked, emphasising the need to avoid giving the killer an advantage.The FBI has also increased the reward for information leading to the suspect’s arrest and conviction to $50,000, adding to the NYPD's $10,000 reward.The murder has sparked online criticism of UnitedHealthCare and the broader health insurance industry.As reported by USA Today, some social media users speculated whether the attack was linked to dissatisfaction with the company’s policies. One commenter described filing claims with the insurer as ""a humiliating and godawful slog,"" while others expressed anger over corporate profits allegedly tied to denying care.Wendell Potter, a former CIGNA executive turned whistleblower, noted that the shooting had become an outlet for people’s frustrations with the healthcare system. ""This is an opportunity for people to vent and take out their anger against someone who just became known to them all of a sudden,"" Potter observed.As the investigation continues, authorities remain focused on tracking the suspect’s movements, urging the public to come forward with any information that might lead to an arrest.","Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot Wednesday morning outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, just before he was due to speak at an investment conference.

Firm stance from the United States

Shadow of Jolani’s leadership

In Syria’s war-stricken complex landscape, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani , the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has become one of the most controversial figures.Although Jolani has sought to rebrand himself and HTS as pragmatic actors in the opposition against the Assad regime, his past connections to al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front cast a long shadow.Recent developments in Syria have brought renewed attention to Jolani’s role, but it was in 2017 that the United States firmly labelled him a terrorist.In 2017, the US government used the official Twitter handle of its Embassy in Syria to portray its stance on Jolani and HTS. Through a series of tweets, the US clarified that HTS was essentially an extension of al-Qaeda in Syria, despite attempts at rebranding.One tweet read, “The core of HTS is Nusra, a designated terrorist organisation. This designation applies regardless of what name it uses or what groups merge into it.”The Embassy account highlighted that HTS’s formation was not a step toward moderation but rather a calculated move to obscure its extremist roots. Another tweet stated, “HTS is a merger and any group that merges into it becomes part of al-Qaeda’s Syrian network.”These tweets were accompanied by a press release that lambasted HTS’s deceptive practices.The release stated that the group’s core aim was to “hijack the Syrian revolution,” with Jolani at its helm. It described him as the operational controller of HTS, whose approach was “volatility,” a reflection of al-Qaeda’s goals masked under a facade of moderation.The US Embassy in Syria’s communications painted Jolani as a central figure in HTS’s operations and ideology. While HTS sought to portray itself as a protector of Syria’s revolutionary aims, the US accused Jolani and his allies of undermining these goals for their gain.A tweet declared, “We remain committed to bringing leading AQS (al-Qaeda in Syria) figures in HTS to justice.”A poster shared by the Embassy explicitly named Jolani as a terrorist and reiterated his allegiance to al-Qaeda. The tweets stressed that HTS’s leadership, despite its rhetoric, remained loyal to al-Qaeda’s strategies, further delegitimising its claims of reform.The US’s reluctance to designate HTS earlier was tied to its complex alliances. One significant factor was HTS’s absorption of the Nour ed-Dine Zenki Brigade, a group that had previously received US weapons and training.This connection raised questions about the implications of officially recognising HTS as a terrorist entity, given the Zenki Brigade’s troubling history, including documented war crimes.This hesitance reflected broader concerns about acknowledging the US’s role in indirectly empowering extremist factions in Syria. It also underscored how political considerations often influence the designation of groups as terrorist organisations.The 2017 declaration by the US Embassy in Syria remains a defining moment in how the international community perceives Jolani and HTS.While HTS has continued efforts to distance itself from its al-Qaeda roots, the accusations levelled by the US cast a long shadow over its legitimacy.","Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) In 2017, the United States firmly labelled him a terrorist.

He called for immediate negotiations, saying, ""There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed."" Trump stated both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. He urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while describing his Saturday meeting with Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron as ""constructive,"" stressed the need for lasting peace. He posted on Telegram, \""When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land.""The Kremlin expressed openness to negotiations, echoing previous statements. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed to a 2022 decree by Zelenskyy that ruled out talks with Putin. This decree followed Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions, a move condemned by Ukraine and the West.Zelenskyy reported 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed and 370,000 wounded since February 2022. Both sides have been hesitant to release official casualty figures.Trump's ceasefire call drew rapid responses from Russia and Ukraine. His past calls for a truce contrast with the Biden administration’s approach, which avoided pushing Ukraine for immediate negotiations. Some fear a quick deal could favor Russia.In an NBC News interview aired Sunday, Trump reiterated his stance on NATO, saying continued US involvement depends on allies' financial contributions and fair treatment. When asked if he would pull the US out of NATO, Trump said, ""If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I'd stay with NATO."" When pressed about withdrawal if conditions weren't met, he responded, ""Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely."" Trump has previously criticized NATO allies for insufficient military spending.","Former President Donald Trump calls for 'immediate' cease-fire in Ukraine war.

Immigration overhaul and birthright citizenship

Immediate pardons for January 6 rioters

Domestic policy plans

Trade policies and foreign relations

'No American carnage'

In his first post-election network television interview, President-elect Donald Trump outlined his vision for his second term during an hour-long conversation with NBC News. Speaking from Trump Tower, he discussed a range of domestic and foreign policy priorities, from pardons for Jan. 6 Capitol rioters to sweeping immigration reforms, trade policies, and promises of national unity.Trump also announced that he would take executive action on his first day in office to end birthright citizenship , a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. This controversial move is expected to face significant legal challenges.Critics argue that some of his plans, particularly those targeting immigration and NATO, could ignite fierce debates in Congress and among international allies.Immigration remains a central focus of Trump’s agenda, with plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, beginning with those convicted of crimes. He acknowledged the challenges of such an operation, saying, “It’s a very tough thing to do…but you have rules, regulations, laws.”Trump also indicated that families with mixed immigration statuses could face deportation together, adding, “I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and send them all back.”On the controversial issue of birthright citizenship, Trump proposed eliminating the constitutional guarantee, even suggesting the possibility of amending the Constitution. “We’ll maybe have to go back to the people,” he said.However, he showed a more conciliatory tone on the issue of Dreamers, individuals brought to the US illegally as children. Trump voiced support for a bipartisan legislative solution, praising Dreamers who have become successful members of society.Trump reiterated his controversial stance on the January 6 Capitol attack, pledging to pardon those convicted for their roles on his first day in office. “These people are living in hell,” he said, arguing that many have faced excessively harsh treatment. He added that he would not direct the Department of Justice or the FBI to pursue investigations into political opponents, framing his approach as a focus on future success rather than retribution.However, he criticized those involved in the investigations against him, calling special counsel Jack Smith “very corrupt” and members of the House committee investigating the attack “political thugs” and “creeps.” While denying plans for punitive actions, Trump suggested his incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel would have the autonomy to make decisions on legal enforcement.Trump vowed to extend tax cuts from his first term and ruled out raising the age for Social Security and Medicare benefits, in contrast to spending reduction efforts led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. When asked about cutting these programs, he stated, “I won’t do it.”On the federal minimum wage, stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009, Trump expressed openness to increasing it but deferred the decision to governors. “I will agree, it’s a very low number,” he acknowledged during NBC interview.Regarding healthcare, Trump called the Affordable Care Act “a disaster” but admitted he lacks a fully developed plan to replace it, saying, “I don’t know that you’ll see it at all.”Trump reaffirmed his intent to levy tariffs on imports from major trading partners, despite acknowledging the potential financial impact on American families. “I can’t guarantee anything,” he admitted when asked if he could ensure families wouldn’t pay more.On foreign policy, Trump maintained a tough stance on NATO, suggesting U.S. participation depends on allied countries paying their share: “If they pay their bills, absolutely.” He also hinted at reduced military aid to Ukraine, stating that while he aims to end the war, the country “can possibly” expect less support from the U.S.In a surprising move, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris after the interview to discuss a path toward peace in Ukraine.In a departure from his 2017 inaugural speech, which infamously referred to “American carnage,” Trump promised a more unifying message this time around. “It will make you happy: unity. It’s going to be a message of unity,” he said.When asked about his message to Americans who didn’t vote for him, Trump pledged equal treatment, saying, “I’m going to treat you every bit as well as I have treated the greatest MAGA supporters.”","President-elect Donald Trump outlined his vision for his second term during an hour-long conversation with NBC News.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt. Arrest warrants were also issued for 45 absconding accused, with the court warning that legal proceedings would begin to declare them fugitives if they failed to appear.Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing at a makeshift court set up in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Khan has been incarcerated. Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

Karachi, meanwhile, recorded an AQI of around 200, indicating ""very unhealthy"" air quality, and ranked as the fourth most polluted city globally. The air quality in Karachi slightly improved during the day but largely remained unsafe.The smog crisis extends beyond Lahore and Karachi, affecting other major cities. Multan reported an AQI of 294, making it the second-most polluted city in Pakistan. Rawalpindi and Peshawar recorded AQIs of 220 and 204, respectively, reflecting a similar trend of dangerously poor air quality, reported the Express Tribune.Even Islamabad, the federal capital, experienced elevated pollution levels, with an AQI of 170, ranking it seventh among Pakistcities. Experts attribute this widespread air pollution to unregulated vehicle emissions, industrial waste, and urban development patterns that neglect environmental considerations.Health experts have raised alarms over the long-term effects of such unprecedented pollution levels, particularly on vulnerable populations. Before this crisis, air pollution was responsible for 12 per cent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan, The Express Tribune reported.With the current smog emergency, these numbers are likely to rise sharply.Children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are expected to bear the brunt of the health consequences, which could have devastating impacts in the coming years if corrective measures are not urgently implemented.","Lahore has emerged as the most polluted city in the world, with air quality levels described as ""hazardous"" The city's PM2.5 concentration levels were measured to be 24.2 times above the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recommended guidelines.

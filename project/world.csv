How're world's trees doing? Here's an assessment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/howre-worlds-trees-doing-heres-an-assessment/articleshow/114830977.cms,"Representative Image

CALI (COLOMBIA): More than one-third of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction , according to the first comprehensive assessment of trees by the world's leading scientific authority on the status of species. The findings, announced Monday by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, are especially sobering given the amount of life that trees sustain. Countless species of other plants, animals and fungi rely on forest ecosystems. Trees are also fundamental to regulating water, nutrients and planet-warming carbon.""Trees are essential to support life on Earth through their vital role in ecosystems, and millions of people depend on them for their lives and livelihoods,"" Grethel Aguilar, director-general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, said in a statement. The tree assessment is considered comprehensive because it includes more than 80% of known tree species. In all, 38% were found to be at risk of extinction. More than 1,000 experts from around the world contributed.Island biodiversity is particularly vulnerable, in part because those species often have small populations that exist nowhere else, and island trees accounted for the highest proportion of trees threatened with extinction. In Madagascar, for example, numerous species of rosewoods and ebonies are threatened. In Borneo, 99 species in the family of trees called Dipterocarpaceae are imperiled. In Cuba, fewer than 75 mature individuals of the red-flowered Harpalyce macrocarpa, known in Spanish as maiden's blood, remain.Around the world, the biggest threats to trees are agriculture and logging, followed by urbanisation, said Emily Beech, head of conservation prioritization at Botanic Gardens Conservation International, a nonprofit group that led the research now included in the Red List.For temperate regions, pests and diseases are major threats to trees. Climate change is an emerging threat, Beech said, and it's unclear how warming will affect the majority of tree species.The group announced the findings in Cali, Colombia, where govt representatives and other participants from countries worldwide have gathered for the United Nations biodiversity conference, which is held every two years. Now in their second week, negotiations are bogged down in tensions over how countries that are poorer economically but often wealthier in biodiversity are going to pay to conserve and restore nature instead of extracting resources.Deforestation is devastating for the climate and biodiversity, but the world has struggled to stop it.In 2021, more than 140 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. So many countries signed on that the agreement covers some 90% of the world's forests.","More than one-third of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction.

SpaceX gets into spy game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spacex-gets-into-spy-game/articleshow/114831007.cms,"SpaceX ceo Elon Musk

WASHINGTON: The breakthrough came last month, about 600 miles above Earth. For the first time, the Pentagon 's Space Development Agency used lasers to more securely transmit data at light speed between military satellites , making it easier to track enemy missiles and if necessary shoot them down.It was a milestone not only for the Pentagon. This was a defining moment for a certain up-and-coming military contractor that had built key parts of this new system: Elon Musk 's SpaceX. SpaceX over the past year started to move in a big way into the business of building military and spy satellites , an industry that has long been dominated by major contractors like Raytheon and Northrop Grumman as well as smaller players like York Space Systems.This shift comes as the Pentagon and US spy agencies are preparing to spend billions of dollars to build a series of new constellations of low-Earth-orbit satellites, much of it in response to recent moves by China to build its own space-based military systems. SpaceX is poised to capitalize on that, generating a new wave of questions inside the federal govt about the company's growing dominance as a military space contractor and Musk's extensive business operations in China and his relations with foreign government leaders, possibly including Russian President Vladimir Putin.Musk is also unpredictable in a sector in which security is often perceived to be synonymous with predictability. He chafes at many of the processes and rules of government, saying they hold back progress, and wants to make his own calls.""The complication is that you're incredibly dependent on a company that is privately held, meaning we have very little visibility into their finances,"" said Todd Harrison, a former space industry executive who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.","Elon Musk's SpaceX is moving into the business of building military and spy satellites.

Freak Offs: ‘Happy to talk’: Investigators speak to male escorts about Diddy’s infamous ‘freak off’ parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/happy-to-talk-investigators-speak-to-male-escorts-about-diddys-infamous-freak-off-parties/articleshow/114830828.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs

The FBI has been interviewing male prostitutes in an attempt to unveil the truth behind Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs' alleged ‘Freak Off’ sex parties .A federal law enforcement source who is involved in the investigation told the NY Post, “They’re all too happy to talk. We’re asking them about their recollections of the Freak Offs , what they were paid to do, and who else was involved. I’m surprised how many of them can recall intricate details about what happened.”According to the New York Post report, many of them have aged out of skin biz and mostly have the same details about the parties, including drugs, viagra and Cialis that were allegedly supplied to male escorts before the parties.They told the FBI, ""They were expected to perform and were told that if they didn’t perform, they’d be thrown out of the party and not paid.”Earlier in March the FBI raided two of Diddy’s homes during which they seized hundreds of sex videos and many sex-related tools and objects, including 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lube. In a statement, the US Attorney’s Office alleged that the sex parties were not always consensual.Sean “Diddy” Combs’ alleged sexual abuse of women included forcing them to engage in frequent, days-long sexual activity with male prostitutes, some of whom were “transported over state lines,” according to the charges against him.“These events, which Combs referred to as ‘Freak Offs,’ were elaborate sex performances that he arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded,” the documents said.“To ensure participation in Freak Offs, Combs used violence and intimidation, and leveraged his power over victims” authorities alleged.“In court, the truth will prevail, Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman,” his attorneys said in a statement.The New York Post said that they have viewed more than a dozen videos of Diddy’s wild parties, and most of those videos were related to some mainstream events or were after parties of those events, such as the MTV Video Music Awards or the Super Bowl.In the footage obtained by the Post, Combs could be seen watching women have sex with men, and in one video he himself took part, holding the camera from his pov while he seemingly engaged in the sexual activity.“We have to identify all the people in the videos,” says the Fed source. “And then we can figure out how old they were at the time, and make sure that none of them were trafficked or threatened to participate. It’s a long process, but we’re making progress.Authorities are trying to determine if any of the participants in Diddy’s Freak Offs were underage or illegally coerced into performing.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has denied any wrongdoing, pleading not guilty and claiming all sexual interactions were consensual. He faces serious charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking , and transportation to engage in prostitution.Additionally, he is charged with over twenty civil lawsuits from alleged victims, including two recent claims from men who allege they were raped by him at ages 10 and 17.","The FBI has been interviewing male prostitutes in an attempt to unveil the truth behind Sean 'Diddy' Combs' alleged 'Freak Off' sex parties.

City’s youngest mayor



Commitment to safety and community



From tech innovator to mayoral candidate



Karthik Naralasetty has long been recognized for his innovative work in technology and social change. From founding Socialblood , a platform that connects blood donors through social media, to advocating for safe communities, Naralasetty’s journey reflects a commitment to making an impact. Now, he’s taking his mission a step further by running for mayor in Texas, hoping to bring his vision to life for the people of The Hills , according to naralasetty.org.Originally from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh , Karthik completed his early education in Delhi before moving to the US to study at Rutgers University. His election would mark a historic moment for The Hills and Texas, as he would be the city’s youngest mayor and the first of Indian descent.Running for office in such a setting has proven challenging. Karthik reports enduring personal attacks and describes the campaign atmosphere as “disheartening and hostile.”“The bullying, personal attacks, and character assassinations I’ve encountered are disappointing, but they strengthen my resolve to focus on what matters: serving the people of The Hills with integrity,” Karthik said.He emphasized his commitment to “bring positive change, listen to all voices, and ensure every resident feels valued.”Karthik’s campaign, he shared, centers around “building an inclusive future where everyone in The Hills feels seen and valued.”“My Indian-American background gives me a unique perspective to bridge cultural gaps and make The Hills a place where diverse voices are celebrated. As mayor, I will preserve our community’s cherished character while embracing progress in safety, technology, and community engagement,” he asserted.Having originally moved from India and lived in fast-paced cities, 35-year-old Naralasetty relocated to The Hills seeking a safer, more connected community for his family. ""Our move wasn’t part of the Covid wave of relocations; it was driven by the terrifying experience of a shootout right outside our home while our two children were inside. That day, we realized that we needed to make a change to ensure the safety and well-being of our family,"" he said.Since settling in The Hills, Naralasetty has become a local advocate, dedicated to enhancing the community’s sense of security and togetherness. His experiences have strengthened his resolve to uphold safety for all residents, a central theme in his mayoral campaign. “We chose The Hills because we wanted a place where our children could grow up free from fear, and I promise to uphold the safety that drew us here every day,” he said.As the founder of Socialblood, Naralasetty demonstrated how technology could serve humanitarian causes. Now, he’s applying that same dedication to his mayoral campaign, aiming to support sustainable growth, safety, and community well-being in The Hills. His vision resonates with residents who seek a leader that values both innovation and the close-knit community spirit The Hills is known for.Karthik Naralasetty’s journey from tech entrepreneur to community advocate to mayoral candidate is driven by a purpose: to create a thriving, safe, and connected community. His campaign is grounded in the values of progress, family, and unity, which he hopes to champion for Texas residents as their future mayor.","Karthik Naralasetty, 35, is running for mayor of The Hills, Texas.

Allan Lichtman Predicts Harris Win Despite Anxieties Over Election: Us election predictions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/election-nostradamus-allan-lichtman-says-hes-anxious-but-wont-change-harris-win-prediction-because-/articleshow/114790634.cms,"Allan Lichtman says he won't change his prediction that Kamala Harris is winning the election.

With five days left for the election as many polls are leaning towards Donald Trump, American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman , called the election Nostradamus because of his track record of perfect prediction, said he will not change his forecast that Kamala Harris will win the election. The prediction was made on September 5, before the ABC News debate and Litchman said ""nothing has changed to change my prediction"". During a livestream Tuesday, he said he's anxious, more anxious not because of the polls but primarily because he's worried about the future of this country.Litchman said he has been doing this for 42 years and every four years. Instead of butterflies, he has a flock of cows in his stomach. ""Of course I'm anxious. Not because of the polls, but primarily because I’m worried about the future of this country.”Lichtman's prediction is not based on polls but on 13 categories which he calls the ""Keys to the White House"" -- and Harris has the edge in eight of those metrics compared to Trump's three.But there is always a possibility that he could be wrong, he conceded. “But it’s always possible that something so cataclysmic and so unprecedented could change the pattern of history.”“My predictions have stood the test of time, my indicators have always been right,” he said. “The keys are very objective and quantitative.”He is a registered Democrat and recently announced that he was cancelling his Washington Post subscription after the paper decided not to endorse a candidate. “There is more election anxiety this year than I have ever seen and I go back to Kennedy-Nixon,” he reflected. “I have never seen this kind of election anxiety because a lot of people believe that the future of the country is on the line here and that democracy in this country could be a thing of the past.”This year, he said he received unprecedented hate in calling the election for Harris. “I have never experienced anything close to the hate that has been reaped upon me this time,” he told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo.“I’ve been getting feedback that is vulgar, violent, threatening, and even beyond that, the safety and security of my family has been compromised.”",American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman says he won't change his prediction that Kamala Harris is winning the election.

Yet another former pageant queen, 53-year-old Beatrice Keul claimed she was groped by Donald Trump everywhere in her body after she was invited to a suite at his New York hotel for a 'private talk'. ""I think my size saved me,"" Keul said to Daily Mail about the 1993 incident. The report said Keul is coming forward now with the allegation because she discovered all the documentation. Trump campaign's national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Keul's accusations are false and planted to distract from the accusations against Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff. ""Fake allegations like this are a disservice to women who are truly victims of assault, like the women in Doug Emhoff's past,"" Levitt said.According to the report, Keul attracted Donald Trump's attention when she won second place in the Miss Switzerland 1992 pageant in Zurich and reached the final round of the Miss Europe competition in Istanbul that year.Keul said she received an invitation from Donald Trump American Dream pageant, offering an all-expense-paid trip to New York and Atlantic city to participate in that contest. ""When you are from Switzerland, the US is a big wow. Then you think about New York, that's a second wow. And then comes the name Trump. Wow again"".""Trump, as a brand, was quite something at that time. You could be blinded by all that. I didn't know it's a jungle there.""""Ah we finally meet, Miss Keul. How nice to meet you finally,"" Keul recollected Donald Trump's first words to here where he mispronounced her name as 'cool'.""He stayed a long time. We talked for so long that everybody was staring at us. A good 10 minutes if not 15. I couldn't believe he was so fond of me,"" she said.There was a press luncheon after which Keul was asked by Trump staff to stay back and she was then taken to the upper floors. ""I thought Trump wanted to talk, as the other guy told me...when I entered, he jumped on me. I just had time to turn. I was not prepared. I tried to do what I could to get rid of him...he kissed on my lips and on the neck. He tried to lift my dress. He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could.""""I'm very tall, that's what helped me a lot...I think my size saved me,"" she said adding that she managed the situation by saying 'let's talk first'. And that deterred Trump who slowed down and asked her whether she wanted to drink something.After half-an-hour chat, ""he asked me to agree to see him again.

""Biden's comments are the latest example of why Kamala Harris ' team has been avoiding campaigning with him,"" Axios reported citing Harris aides who call Biden both ""unpopular and undisciplined"".Harris' aides were frustrated last week too when Biden went to New Hampshire and said ""we gotta lock (Trump) up"".

China's unease: Halloween's growing popularity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-unease-halloweens-growing-popularity/articleshow/114761747.cms,"In Shanghai this Halloween, police presence was unmissable and their vigilance palpable. (AI image for representation only).

Driving the news

According to reports, Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes.

who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes. Videos circulating on social media show police imposing crowd control and restricting pedestrian flow, in some cases, escorting costumed partygoers—including those dressed as Donald Trump and superheroes like Batman and Superman—away from public spaces, news report said.

The scene contrasts sharply with last year’s festivities, which drew widespread attention and even a nod from the Shanghai municipal government as a symbol of ""cultural tolerance.""

A bar and restaurant owner in the Jing An nightlife district of Shanghai was asked to sign an agreement issued by the local district authorities pledging they would not organise any activities such as costume contests ""to maintain good social order and public image"", he told Reuters.

However, with tightened restrictions this year, social media users have expressed concerns that Halloween, once an opportunity for social commentary, is becoming another casualty in the narrowing space for personal freedom in China.

The news of Shanghai's crackdown on Halloween was a trending topic on Chinese social media sites, including Weibo.

""Even in relatively open Shanghai, the scale of freedom is constantly shrinking,"" one user posted.

Why it matters

Halloween has gained popularity among young Chinese in recent years as a platform for self-expression, a rare outlet in an otherwise tightly controlled society. Since last year's celebrations openly mocked government policies through costumes—like hazmat suits symbolizing strict Covid-19 lockdowns—the Chinese government is likely wary that the festival could ignite further expressions of dissent or even inspire protests akin to the rare, anti-lockdown demonstrations from last year.

Authorities in Shanghai seem determined to prevent any recurrence of last year’s outspoken festivities, which could signal a broader crackdown on public gatherings and, more subtly, on displays of Western cultural influence.

The big picture

China's youth unemployment, currently high, and general economic stagnation have led to widespread frustration, and last year, many used Halloween as a way to express these concerns.

Some students dressed as unemployed graduates, while others donned costumes poking fun at government restrictions.

The mood mirrored a wider, underlying discontent, exacerbated by the pandemic’s lingering economic effects and the government's strict zero-Covid measures, which only lifted last year.

With this year’s tighter restrictions, analysts suggest authorities are aiming to curb any gathering that could serve as a platform for social criticism, particularly after the White Paper Protests in 2022, when young people took to the streets to challenge pandemic policies and highlight issues from economic stagnation to censorship.

The crackdown on Halloween is viewed by many as a preemptive measure to deter similar forms of public expression.

What they’re saying

Zoom in: Halloween 2022 vs 2023

Between the lines

The bottom line

While Halloween celebrations were once a sign of Shanghai’s “cultural tolerance,” the restrictions this year suggest that China’s social landscape may be narrowing under tightened controls.

For China’s young people, who once saw the holiday as a chance to voice their frustrations, the crackdown serves as a stark reminder of the limits on public expression in an increasingly monitored society. The question now is whether this Halloween marks the beginning of a new phase in China’s oversight of public gatherings—and what it means for young Chinese eager to express themselves, even within the limited bounds of a Western holiday.

As Michael Luo put it, “It’s obviously a very happy holiday. Even though it’s foreign culture, it’s still quite fun.” For now, however, that fun seems overshadowed by the mounting restrictions shaping life in China’s most cosmopolitan city.

What’s next

The government’s approach raises questions about the future of Halloween—and similar Western-inspired events—in China. Although some official celebrations went ahead at theme parks like Shanghai Disneyland , smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings.

, smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings. Shanghai Disneyland, however, proceeded with its annual Halloween event, drawing significant attention as one of the few venues spared from restrictions. Still, many wonder if even these authorized events might come under scrutiny if Halloween continues to serve as a platform for social commentary.

The government’s wariness of gatherings perceived as implicitly critical of policies could extend to other Western-inspired events like Christmas, which has also gained traction in Chinese cities.

Chinese authorities have shown unprecedented concern over Halloween celebrations this year, implementing stricter controls and issuing warnings across major cities. This heightened scrutiny stems from several factors affecting the nation's social and cultural landscape.This year, videos posted on Chinese social media show officers actively targeting people in costumes, asking some to remove makeup or refrain from wearing “bizarre” clothing. As per a New York Times report, Shanghai resident Michael Luo, a bar owner, voiced frustration over the crackdown, calling it “a waste of resources.” He added that authorities should focus on ensuring public safety and enjoyment rather than stifling celebrations, which are popular even in non-Westernized settings like China.In contrast, some netizens on Weibo expressed disappointment at the heavy police presence, lamenting the restriction of cultural events. “Shanghai is not supposed to be like this,” one user wrote, criticizing the city’s perceived shift from tolerance to repression, the CNN report said.Last year’s Halloween in Shanghai was notable not just for its turnout but for its tone—many young people used costumes to comment on China’s social and economic landscape. A popular costume last year featured blank sheets of paper, an ironic reference to China’s censorship, while others dressed as Covd testers or stock market crash victims. Revelers created a carnival-like atmosphere that had not been seen since the end of lockdowns, and authorities initially tolerated the display, acknowledging it as a form of “cultural exchange.”This year, however, any form of “edginess” appears off-limits. Barriers were set up on Julu Road, a popular Halloween spot, and police patrols deterred would-be revelers, effectively halting celebrations.Some partygoers reported being escorted to police stations, where they were asked to remove their costumes before being allowed to leave. Videos show that police focused their actions on people wearing costumes, while those in everyday clothing were left unbothered.China’s tightening stance on Halloween can be seen as part of a broader skepticism toward Western cultural traditions, which the government often frames as a potential threat to Chinese social values. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under President Xi Jinping has intensified its focus on promoting Chinese culture, criticizing foreign festivals as “overly passionate” distractions. Chinese state media, in particular, has been vocal in recent years about resisting Western influence, and Halloween, with its American origins, has become a particular target.Some scholars, such as Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore, argue that the government is attempting to reshape Chinese society by stifling gatherings that may incite social discontent. Wu remarked, “The authorities are far more prepared this year,” citing the likely intention to prevent any repeat of last year’s protest-like festivities.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai dressed in Halloween costumes. Videos circulating on social media show police imposing crowd control and restricting pedestrian flow.

"Marvel stars unite: RDJ, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo endorse Kamala Harris in playful video call",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/marvel-stars-unite-rdj-scarlett-johansson-mark-ruffalo-endorse-kamala-harris-in-playful-video-call/articleshow/114832569.cms,"Stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe rallied together on a video call to show their support for Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the US election. The video, posted on social media by Mark Ruffalo , features Marvel heavyweights like Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson , Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle brainstorming slogans to back Harris, whose campaign has drawn widespread celebrity endorsements.The Avengers actors kick off their reunion with Johansson greeting her fellow ""Avengers"" as they “assemble” for a virtual discussion on voting. The group shares humorous moments, with Downey Jr. suggesting that Harris needs a catchphrase for her campaign. In a playful attempt to create a memorable slogan, they try out lines like “I’m down with democracy,” but quickly realise the phrase might convey an unintended message. Cheadle, imitating Harris's voice, delivers the line, “I’m Kamala Harris, and I say down with democracy,” sparking laughter among the group.Ruffalo, the video’s host, shifts the conversation to a more serious note, encouraging viewers to make their voting plans and bring friends and family to the polls. The light-hearted exchange serves as a call to action, with Ruffalo reminding audiences about the significance of voting. Although the Avengers couldn’t settle on an official slogan for Harris, their message of support for her candidacy is clear. “Kamala forever!” jokes Gurira, a nod to her role as Okoye in Black Panther.Ruffalo shared the video on Twitter and added, ""Don’t sit this one out. It’s the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women’s reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines. This shit is real and it’s going to come for you.""This latest celebrity endorsement adds to Harris’s high-profile support, which includes names like Beyonce, LeBron James, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Aniston, and Leonardo DiCaprio. With the race nearing its end, both Harris and former President Donald Trump are vying for last-minute support from voters, particularly in key battleground states. Polls indicate tight races in Georgia and North Carolina, where Trump and Harris are separated by only one or two percentage points, underscoring the stakes of the election.According to recent data from CNN, more than 61 million Americans have already cast their ballots through early voting or mail-in options, a record-breaking early turnout. The race in Georgia and North Carolina is particularly close, with Harris leading among Black voters and college-educated voters, while Trump holds a significant advantage among white voters without college degrees.","Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle join forces to back Kamala Harris.

Most accurate pollster of 2020 releases battleground state polls: Key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-accurate-pollster-of-2020-releases-battleground-state-polls-key-details/articleshow/114831084.cms,"With less than a, AtlasIntel , the polling firm renowned for its accuracy in the 2020 elections, has released its latest battleground poll, indicating a clear lead for Donald Trump across seven critical swing states. The poll shows Trump ahead in all these states, a potential game-changer for his campaign as he seeks to reclaim the presidency.According to the poll results, Trump leads in Arizona by 5 points, North Carolina by 4, and Nevada by 4. The margins are tighter in Georgia (Trump +2), Pennsylvania (Trump +1), and Michigan (Trump +1), while Kamala Harris narrowly leads in Wisconsin by just 0.3%. This data suggests that if the election were held today, Trump would secure 312 electoral votes, significantly surpassing the threshold needed for victory.Nationally, Trump holds a 1.9% lead in the popular vote, with 49.1% support compared to Harris’s 47.2%. The remaining 3.7% of respondents remain undecided or support other candidates. AtlasIntel's CEO said, ""The polls AtlasIntel released today were not our final polls. Expect one or two more releases prior to Election Day.""With just a few days to go for the United States elections, a staggering 61.0 million Americans have already made their voices heard by casting their ballots in the November election, according to a report by CNN. Notably, voters have cast their ballots either by mail or through early in-person voting for the presidential elections between Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump.Meanwhile, new CNN polls conducted by SSRS reveal that the presidential race is heating up in Georgia and North Carolina, with the latest polls showing a neck-and-neck contest between Harris and Trump. Likely voters in Georgia divide 48% for Trump to 47% for Harris, and in North Carolina, Harris stands at 48% to Trump's 47%. These narrow margins are within the poll's margin of error, indicating no clear frontrunner in either state.It is interesting to note that North Carolina, which supported former President Barack Obama in 2008, has voted Republican in the past three presidential elections. However, in 2020, Trump won against US President Joe Biden. Joe Biden made history in Georgia four years ago by defeating Donald Trump with a margin of less than 1 percentage point, becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton's victory in 1992.In both states, Harris is leading among Black likely voters (84% to 13% in Georgia; 78% to 19% in North Carolina) and voters with college degrees (55% to 39% in Georgia; 53% to 42% in North Carolina). On the other hand, Trump holds a commanding lead, 81% to 15%, among white voters without college degrees in Georgia, while leading by a less overwhelming margin, 65% to 31%, in North Carolina.As the candidates campaign in the battleground states, they are not just vying for votes but also addressing pressing issues like border security and immigration, particularly in states with significant Latino populations.","AtlasIntel released its latest battleground poll, indicating a clear lead for Donald Trump across seven critical swing states.

"Donald Trump sues CBS over Kamala Harris’s ‘60 Minutes’ interview, citing 'misleading' editing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-sues-cbs-over-kamala-harriss-60-minutes-interview-citing-misleading-editing/articleshow/114830756.cms,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against CBS on Thursday, accusing the network of deceptive editing in a recent "" 60 Minutes "" interview with Democratic rival Kamala Harris . The legal action, filed in the Northern District of Texas, alleges that CBS selectively edited Harris’s responses about US policy on the Israel-Hamas conflict, presenting a skewed narrative to the public ahead of the US election.According to Trump’s legal team, Harris’s answer to a question about the Biden administration’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict was edited in a way that removed what the lawsuit describes as a “confusing” segment. The complaint argues that the omitted portion, which it labels a “word salad,” would have highlighted Harris’s inability to clearly address US influence over Israel’s wartime conduct. Trump claims this selective editing was done to shield Harris from public scrutiny and demands approximately $10 billion in damages, alleging that CBS violated Texas laws against deceptive business practices.CBS has forcefully rejected the accusations, releasing a statement defending the integrity of the interview. “Former President Trump’s repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false,” a CBS statement said. “The interview was not doctored, and 60 Minutes did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris’s answer to the question at issue. The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.” CBS also asserted that the interview was edited solely to adhere to time constraints, maintaining that “60 Minutes fairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, not to mislead it.”This latest lawsuit escalates a public clash between Trump and CBS that has been brewing for weeks. Trump has repeatedly criticized CBS and “60 Minutes” on the campaign trail, describing their actions as “election interference.” He has further claimed that CBS attempted to “save” Harris from embarrassment by replacing what he considered a poor response with a more polished one.In past statements, CBS confirmed that a different portion of Harris’s answer appeared in a promotional clip on “Face the Nation” but insisted the original “60 Minutes” broadcast presented her full response. The network highlighted that the edit was a standard practice to fit the program’s allotted time, adding that they follow consistent principles for all interviews, regardless of the interviewee’s status.This lawsuit comes as both candidates continue their campaigns for next week’s election, in what polls suggest is a tightly contested race. Trump’s team has also indicated that he may seek to revoke CBS’s broadcasting license if he returns to the White House.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against CBS on Thursday, accusing the network of deceptive editing in a recent "" 60 Minutes "" interview with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.

There are 8,000 North Korean troops in Russia 's Kursk region, US ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood told the Security Council on Thursday and asked Moscow whether they would still stand with the statement that there are no DPRK troops in their country.""I have a very respectful question for my Russian colleague: Does Russia still maintain that there are no DPRK troops in Russia?"" Wood said as quoted by Reuters.The Russian representative did not address the inquiry, and Russia has avoided explicit confirmation or denial of these troops' presence.Following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces advanced into the Kursk border region in August 2023, where they maintain a presence. Ukraine has identified three North Korean generals allegedly supervising their country's troops in Russia.Multiple nations, including the US, Britain, and South Korea, contend that Russia's use of North Korean troops violates U.N. resolutions and its founding charter. These actions conflict with sanctions designed to restrict North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs.Tensions escalated at the Security Council meeting when the US accused China of providing extensive support to Russia's defense industry.

It's the garbage , stupid.MAGA Trumpers and Democrats took aim at each other over characterizing their opponents as ""garbage,"" as the stink of mutual denigration enveloped Presidential elections in the self-described greatest country on earth.Seizing on President Joe Biden's putdown of Trump supporters as ""garbage"" and rejecting his clarification that he only meant a Trump rally comedian who called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage,"" the MAGA supremo taunted Democrats by donning a sanitation worker's uniform and driving a garbage truck on Wednesday.“How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,” Trump told reporters during his salvo. “For Joe Biden to make that statement — it’s really a disgrace.”MAGA faithful, including Elon Musk , saw it as a brilliant act of trolling Dems, but anti-Trumpers saw it as an apt metaphor for a man not short of trash-talk.""Interesting choice to place the garbage in the front of the truck,"" Trump's niece Mary Trump, an anti-MAGA commentator, observed about her 78-year old uncle taking the front passenger seat. Other critics mused about the sight of a man who sits on a golden toilet driving a garbage truck to make a point, even as he stumbled towards the truck in an awkward manner.Anti-Trumpers also rolled out ads and memes showing the MAGA motormouth calling his opponents, including Kamala Harris and her followers, ""garbage"" ""scum"" etc on numerous occasions, not to speak of characterizing the US itself as a ""garbage can"" that other countries are dumping illegal migrants into.“It’s the people that surround her (Kamala Harris), they’re scum and they want to take down our country.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)

Latin Grammy Award-winner Nicky Jam recently announced he would no longer endorse Donald Trump , citing disrespectful comments about Puerto Rico from a comedian at a Trump rally. In a post on Instagram, the Puerto Rican reggaeton artist explained that his initial support for Trump had been rooted in the belief that Trump’s background as a businessman would positively impact the U.S. economy, which he saw as crucial for Latino communities and immigrants in the country. However, following disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico, Nicky Jam renounced any political support for Trump, stressing the importance of respecting Puerto Rico.The remarks in question came from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe , who performed at Trump’s 2024 rally in New York City and made a controversial joke likening Puerto Rico to “a floating island of garbage.” Reports noted that Hinchcliffe’s set contained additional inflammatory language aimed at Latino, Jewish, and Black communities, all of whom represent key voter demographics in the upcoming election.Hinchcliffe has previously faced similar backlash; in 2021, he was dropped by his talent agency and saw numerous gigs cancelled after using a racial slur directed at Asian American comedian Peng Dang during a performance in Austin, Texas. Despite this, he did not issue an apology.Hinchcliffe’s latest comments appear to have galvanised Latin American artists, with Puerto Rican music icon Bad Bunny quickly declaring his support for Vice President Kamala Harris in response. Other Latin artists have since followed suit, expressing their support for Harris. Meanwhile, Trump described the rally as a “love fest,” though many observers have disagreed, pointing to the divisive rhetoric on display.","Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Nicky Jam announced he would no longer endorse Donald Trump.

'Wisdom of crowds': Could political betting swing the US election?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polymarket-betting-market-musk/articleshow/114817885.cms,"Historically, political betting is impressively accurate.

The problem of reflexivity

Self-fulfilling prophecies

As the 1549 papal conclave dragged on into a second and third month, Venice’s ambassador to the Vatican, Matteo Dandolo, was outraged by insider trading. “It is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll,” he said, “and that the cardinals’ attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands.”Although the conclave was supposedly secret, Roman traders ran a thriving market in the streets around the Vatican trying to predict the winner. Odds shifted rapidly, and bettors appeared suspiciously well informed and perceptive. Everyone knew the race was wide open, and the original favorite in the crowded field, at 5-to-1 against (or 17% odds), was Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte. Ten weeks later, he was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate, but only after opposing cardinals had brought forward a parade of options. Bettors on the streets helped the population understand who was leading, and by spotting early on that Julius might be the inoffensive candidate who would provoke the least opposition, they even guided the cardinals as they tried to break the deadlock.Prediction markets grew so widespread and so disliked that by the end of the 16th century, Pope Gregory XIV had outlawed them. The penalty for betting on the identity of the next pope was excommunication.Five centuries later, the urge to bet on elections has not abated. Neither has the whiff of corruption surrounding them, nor the sense that bettors’ money can move not just markets but election results themselves. For centuries there have been cycles of political betting — in 19th century Pall Mall clubs, and in the early 20th century on the floors of the New York and London stock exchanges — punctuated by moves to ban them. As the 2024 presidential campaign drives towards a bitter conclusion, the cycle is repeating.This time the ultimate authority is not the pope but the US Supreme Court. At present, the US’s biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments with tight limits on how much can be wagered — the best known are the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt.com, which operates in the US under the auspices of Victoria University in New Zealand. Now, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market, which would allow Americans to take part without limits on how much they can trade.In the latest round, the for-profit Kalshi futures market won a stay against the CFTC’s ban that cleared the way for a huge experiment. The litigation could go on for years, but Kalshi can run a market on this year’s election, and its odds now appear in huge neon lights above Times Square. This has prompted established brokers to get in on the act; Interactive Brokers also launched political futures trading for the election.The world’s richest man is paying attention. Earlier this month, Elon Musk urged his followers on the online platform X, which he owns, to follow the offshore venue Polymarket (launched by his former colleague Peter Thiel). “More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line,” he wrote. At the time, Polymarket showed Donald Trump ’s chances at 50.1%. Hours later, and with no relevant news, a still-anonymous French investor made the first of a series of giant trades now totaling some $45 million on a Trump win, pushing his odds way up. Ten days later, with Kamala Harris still ahead in polls of polls, Trump’s chances had surged to 62.2%.PredictIt, populated mostly by academics limited to stakes of $850, also raised Trump’s chances, but at a much slower pace. The press was more interested in Polymarket. Since Musk’s tweet it has featured in 10 times more news stories than PredictIt. Polymarket’s odds helped change the narrative in markets where far more money is at stake. Treasury yields and share prices both rose, as traders started pricing in a Trump win and the corporate tax cuts that would come with it.Like all markets, popular prediction markets are prone to what the hedge fund manager George Soros calls “reflexivity.” Rather than just reflecting or reacting to facts on the ground, moves in bonds, stocks or oil markets can actually change that reality. It is this fear that animates opposition to Kalshi. The pressure group Better Markets, an amicus in the CFTC’s suit, asserts that manipulating these markets could shift the facts. Cantrell Dumas, its director of derivatives policy, says that if the markets are taken seriously and show that one candidate is likely to win “people could stay home and not vote for their preferred candidate.”On the other side, Kalshi’s supporters argue that manipulation is a problem for all markets, and the key is regulation. David Mason, general counsel of PredictIt and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission argues, “these manipulation problems are dealt with in regulated markets every day. There are trading exclusions; if they have material non-public information then they are prohibited from trading. Kalshi has a long list of people who aren’t allowed to trade.”But Dumas rejects the comparison. “In a traditional market, if a regulator sees manipulation and takes action, it has remedies. With election manipulation that changes the result, that’s irreparable harm. It’s a fundamental distinction,” he told me.The excitement since Musk’s tweet looks very much like reflexivity in action. And social change has amplified the potential reflexive power of markets. We are now far more inclined to trust in the “wisdom of crowds.” Most importantly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, developed in the 1950s and the basis for much modern finance, holds that markets continuously incorporate all information, and so they can’t be consistently beaten, except by insiders who know something others don’t. Central to the argument for investing passively in indexes and exchange-traded funds, this idea can transmogrify into a belief that markets can’t be wrong.Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The academics Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz demonstrated 20 years ago that over history, markets had come closer to getting presidential elections right (with an average error of 1.5%) than the Gallup poll, which was on average off by 2.1%. Market discipline should help experts thrash out a better consensus estimate, and many companies now run internal prediction markets to improve forecasting. Wikipedia and Google have convinced us that crowd-sourcing information can work, and popular culture is saturated with tales of brilliant statisticians, like Michael Lewis’ 2003 book Moneyball on how the Oakland A’s used statistics to spot good players others had missed. Nate Silver, an adviser to Polymarket, made his name as a baseball statistician.Then there’s what Wall Streeters call the Elaine Garzarelli Effect: We tend to place excessive trust in whichever guru made a good call last time. As a Lehman Brothers investment strategist, Garzarelli brilliantly urged clients to get out of the stock market the week before the Black Monday crash in 1987. That made her one of the most widely quoted strategists on the Street; her words would move markets, and she compiled a good track record. But she was fallible — in December 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, she proclaimed that stocks were undervalued by 25% — and people lost interest.In politics, the offshore Intrade prediction market developed a Garzarelli effect after calling 49 states correctly in 2008, and then all 50 — amid much attention — in 2012. Then regulators shut it down, but other venues rose to replace it. The market odds on a Donald Trump victory were about 35% on election night in 2016.Betting markets may also have grown more reflexive because the legalization of sports betting has made gambling socially acceptable, while investing looks ever more like gambling. Baseball banned Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose for life over wagering on the sport. Now, Major League Baseball has its own formal spread-betting partner. Investment apps now resemble video games: Robinhood.com drove the meme stock craze of 2021 as people poured stimulus checks, and a lot of political anger, into bets on companies like GameStop Corp. While papal envoys disdained people betting in the street, our current society has little problem with people trading elections on their phones.Reflexivity is amplified by a constant of human nature; our psychological need for an anchor. We want a number, and once we have one we cling to it, because it gives us an illusion of control. The idea of anchoring has been a staple of behavioral finance since it was first applied to economics by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 50 years ago. Their experiments showed that people’s answers to numeric questions can be skewed just by showing them a number at random before they answer. In the unmoored climate of a polarized election that appears to be in a dead heat, our desire for an anchor will naturally grow.In the UK’s Brexit referendum, betting markets put the chances that Britons would vote to leave the EU at one in five. Statisticians David Rothschild and Andrew Gelman argued afterwards that there was “a feedback mechanism whereby the betting-market odds reify themselves.” People distrusted polls, they said, but “we do watch the prediction markets, which all sorts of experts have assured us capture the wisdom of crowds.” Pollsters and pundits — and even the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage — were “to some extent anchoring themselves off the prediction odds,” and dismissed polls that showed Brexit in the lead. The clue, Rothschild and Gelman argued, was that a “mature prediction market should show measured, but real, swings in prices in response to news,” but the Brexit odds stayed weirdly stable.Polls closed with the market odds of Brexit at 31%. When they were proved wrong, the pound dropped by more than 10% in a matter of minutes — more than treble its previous worst fall. Brexit looks very much like a classic example of Soros’ reflexivity at work — and on the face of it, suggests that the CFTC is amply justified in trying to keep political betting out of mainstream investment.The CFTC’s problem is that the other markets it regulates exist to help manage risks, from fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates to the possibility of a catastrophic hurricane. Investors wish to insure against political surprises — with the fallout from the Brexit vote showing why they might be sensible. So how to allow that, while limiting the chance of either deliberate manipulation or innocent irrational exuberance which, with reflexivity, could turn markets into a tool for changing election results? There are two plausible solutions.The first, advocated by Kalshi and Polymarket, is to make markets liquid by attracting more money. With billions at stake, no individual can move the market. But for now, while they remain on a smaller scale, whales can make a big splash.The alternative is to limit liquidity. PredictIt’s $850 limit on stakes thwarts whales. A rich person’s views don’t count for more just because they’re rich. But it’s harder to move the price when genuine news happens, and it reduces the market’s usefulness as a place to manage risk. Limited markets might produce the public good of more robust predictions, but a multi-trillion dollar manager like BlackRock cannot hedge a given election result on PredictIt.Recent experiences with opening new markets have shown how difficult this can be. In the decade before the global financial crisis, quants spotted that emerging markets and commodity futures tended to gain over time, with a low correlation to stocks and bonds. That sounded like the holy grail for asset allocators, and big institutions piled in. Once they did so, however, they changed the way these markets behaved and interacted. If money moved into copper as a result of a deliberate decision to move out of bonds, for example, it was inevitable that bonds and copper would grow more correlated, which they did. In 2008, stocks, commodities and emerging markets all crashed together.Similarly, once big financial hedgers and/or wealthy individuals arrive in betting markets, there’s no reason to assume those markets will keep behaving the same way. Treasury bonds, oil or tech stocks are deep markets combining people with many different motivations, and the messages they send should be taken very seriously; Kalshi, Polymarket and others are far from that scale.There’s also the eternal issue of Garbage In, Garbage Out. Markets synthesize information and give participants an incentive to sniff out fake news. But they aren’t a protection against bad information — if the polls are wrong, markets will be wrong.If well regulated, political prediction markets might yet provide probabilities that help guide us in times of uncertainty. But like all markets they will be prone to get things wrong, and while they remain largely unregulated, it behooves us to be careful. The threat of excommunication doesn’t deter miscreants the way it once did.","Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market. At present, the US’s biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114818102,imgsize-137130,width-400,resizemode-4/114818102.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border. The attack happened in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. About 20 to 25 militants targeted the Frontier Constabulary post, a police assistance force. The Pakistan Taliban , also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed the attack in a statement to AFP.Since the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has faced a surge in terrorism, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan. Recent anti-terror operations in North Waziristan led to the elimination of about a dozen militants this month. In the most recent operation Pakistani security forces killed nine insurgents, including a high-level target, in a shootout overnight in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the volatile northwestern region that borders Afghanistan, the military said Thursday.According to a Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, violence increased sharply in 2024, with a 90% surge in fatalities in the third quarter alone.

Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi released after Islamabad HC grants bail in graft case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imrans-wife-bushra-bibi-released-after-islamabad-hc-grants-bail-in-graft-case/articleshow/114558908.cms,"Photo/Agencies

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114559235,imgsize-930013,width-400,resizemode-4/114559235.jpg"

Fake news of rape sparks real protest in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fake-news-of-rape-sparks-real-protest-in-pakistan/articleshow/114538687.cms,"The recent reports of a college campus rape that went viral on social media have sparked a heated debate in Pakistan . While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.

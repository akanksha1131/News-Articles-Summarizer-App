Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car.

Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday justified his stance on a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” by citing Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,” said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Section 212(f) authorises the president to suspend entry of “any aliens or of any class of aliens” if their admission is deemed detrimental to US national interests.Trump has doubled down and remains firm in his stand, despite appeals from multiple United Nations (UN) agencies, including its human rights office, urging the US administration to continue allowing asylum seekers. His previous posts on X also warned of measures including denaturalisation of migrants who “undermine domestic tranquility,” ending federal benefits for non-citizens, and deporting foreign nationals considered a “public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.The White House and Department of Homeland Security have not clarified how these measures will be implemented.The administration has already taken concrete steps consistent with the freeze. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed that asylum officers have been instructed to halt issuing decisions until “enhanced vetting can be completed for every applicant,” citing public safety as the top priority. The US State Department, led by secretary Marco Rubio, simultaneously paused visa issuance for all travellers holding Afghan passports, describing the move as a security measure. “The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people,” Rubio said.The new restrictions follow a Wednesday shooting near the White House in which two National Guard soldiers were critically injured. Spec Sarah Beckstrom, 20, later died of her injuries, while Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalised, 'fighting for life' as Trump said.The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, is expected to face first-degree murder charges, with additional counts likely, according to Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington, DC.According to the Washington Post, the pause also affects all decisions on asylum claims, including those filed by migrants seeking protection from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. At the end of 2024, USCIS had over 1.4 million pending affirmative asylum claims, and the suspension is expected to exacerbate delays.",US President Donald Trump justified his stance on a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” by citing Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) The new restrictions follow a Wednesday shooting near the White House in which two National Guard soldiers were critically injured.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125667796,imgsize-628058,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-11-30t075704.jpg"

Karoline's Family HIT By ICE Arrests; ‘Illegals, Can’t Let…’: Huge Embarrassment For Trump’s Secy





Several protesters were arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a confrontation outside a government parking garage, where they were protesting possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, the New York Police Department said.The incident unfolded outside a facility on Centre and Hester Streets, on the edge of Chinatown where dozens of federal agents appeared to be gathering for a potential immigration raid nearby, according to police and witnesses. The situation quickly escalated as crowds grew, The New York Times reported.According to ABC News, demonstrators were seen blocking vehicles and shouting “ICE out of New York,” including at one point preventing a van from leaving the garage. The NYPD said officers observed protesters blocking the street and issued multiple orders to disperse; when they did not comply, officers made arrests. The force confirmed that “multiple” people were taken into custody but did not immediately specify the number or list charges.NYPD said in a statement that officers “observed multiple people blocking the street and were told multiple times to disperse but they did not comply.”The New York Times reported that the confrontation began shortly after 11 am, when protesters formed a physical barricade at the garage entrance and piled bags of rubbish beside them as federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security arrived. By early afternoon, nearly 200 demonstrators had gathered, chanting at agents who looked on from inside.Police arrived to separate the groups and install metal barricades, but tensions heightened shortly after 1.15 pm, when federal vehicles attempted to leave the garage. Protesters chased the vehicles down Canal Street, with some throwing planters and rubbish bins. A masked agent was seen spraying something from a vehicle window, the NY Times reported. NYPD officers and protesters continued to clash on the street as the federal convoy drove off.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests from either outlet for comment on whether an operation had been planned.Saturday’s clash came a month after a large federal enforcement action in the same area, during which nine people were arrested. ABC News reported that four U.S. citizens detained during that earlier operation were held for nearly 24 hours without federal charges, according to local congressman Dan Goldman. The renewed activity comes amid expectations of intensified immigration enforcement under US President Donald Trump and growing concern among New York officials about future raids.","Several protesters were arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a confrontation outside a government parking garage.

Celebrated Alabama Teacher CAUGHT Assaulting Her Child On Video, Fired As Police Move In | WATCH





Jason Hudson, a 48-year-old man from Deatsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 965 years in prison on November 19, 2025, after an Autauga County jury convicted him in October of 84 counts related to child sex crimes. The charges included first-degree rape, sodomy, incest, sexual abuse of a child under 12, and producing and possessing child pornography.Authorities launched the probe after Hudson downloaded tagged child sex abuse material on information-sharing platforms, triggering alerts to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). The Autauga County Sheriff's Office uncovered thousands of images and videos depicting male and female children, some under age 2, enduring sexual abuse and torture with whips, fire, and rope. Further searches revealed home videos Hudson made of himself raping, sodomizing, and sexually abusing a child under 12.Sentences were imposed consecutively by 19th Judicial Circuit Presiding Judge Amanda Baxley: 90 years each for rape, sodomy, incest, and five production counts; 20 years for sexual abuse; and 10 years (3 to serve) each for 75 possession counts.In court, the victim branded Hudson a ""monster"" in their impact statement, stating they had ""achieved more than they thought was possible"" and that Hudson ""no longer has a hold on their life.""Hudson's wife, Farren Jill Hudson, 37, pleaded guilty in July 2025 to first-degree sodomy against a child under 12 and received 30 years in prison.District Attorney C.J. Robinson hailed the victim as a ""truly brave survivor"" who confronted her abuser without hesitation. He lamented the unavailability of the death penalty, calling the case unforgettable and among the most disturbing evidence he had encountered.The investigation involved the Autauga County Sheriff's Office, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, Butterfly Bridge Children's Advocacy Center, and the district attorney's office","Jason Hudson, a 48-year-old man from Deatsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 965 years in prison on November 19, 2025.

Sean “Diddy” Combs organised a Thanksgiving meal for roughly 1,000 inmates at FCI Fort Dix, where he is currently serving a 50-month sentence. According to TMZ, Combs worked with an internal inmate group called Bankroll Bosses to buy food from the commissary, prepare it over two days and distribute it to every housing unit inside the New Jersey facility.Combs said the aim was to ensure people had something to eat during the holiday period. “Thanksgiving, to me, is about making sure other people eat,” he said, adding that inmates often struggle with being away from their families during the holidays. Due to the lack of kitchen equipment in the prison, those involved in the preparation used improvised tools, including ID cards for cutting.According to B.I., a former gang leader who helped coordinate the effort, the group prepared enough food for about 200 inmates per building. The prison itself provided a standard Thanksgiving meal, but Combs and the group opted to supplement it with additional food items purchased internally.Speaking about life inside the facility, Combs said there was a sense of support among inmates. “There’s a lot of misinterpretations about prison. There is a strong brotherhood. We all look out for each other,” he said, describing the Thanksgiving effort as “a little bit of home in a dark place.”Combs has been at FCI Fort Dix since 30 October, serving his sentence for violating the Mann Act.","Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs organised a Thanksgiving meal for roughly 1,000 inmates at FCI Fort Dix, where he is currently serving a 50-month sentence.

In a country obsessed with dynasties, scandals, and generational rebellions, it is Nalin — not Nikki — who is driving the conversation.He has the crisp confidence of somebody born into public life, the contrarian instincts of a debater who never lost a round in school, and the generational frustration of someone who believes his cohort was handed the economy at closing time. That cocktail has made him an online magnet for praise, criticism, fascination, and endless Google searches.So let’s walk through the Internet’s favourite questions about him — one by one — and answer them properly.No.This bizarre search term refuses to die, largely because the algorithm cannot distinguish curiosity from chaos. Nalin Haley is not married, not publicly dating, and has never hinted at any relationship. The fascination is pure internet noise, not biography.If you strip away the editorial footnotes and the awkward phrasing, the story is clear.Nalin Haley is a 24-year-old American political voice who grew up in a family that straddled multiple identities — Christian parents, Sikh grandparents, and the complexities of being raised in the South by a mother who built herself into one of the country’s most recognisable Indian-American conservatives.His page reads less like a diary and more like the origin arc of a Gen-Z firebrand who discovered politics not as inheritance but as indignation.He does, but it is spectacularly uninteresting — which, ironically, is part of the appeal.For someone becoming a viral political figure, his professional footprint is surprisingly minimal: a clean educational summary, a few internships, the occasional campaign involvement.It gives him the odd credibility of a young man who didn’t spend his adolescence polishing résumés; he spent it forming opinions.His parents are Nikki and Michael Haley.But this question keeps trending for a reason: Nalin is not a polite echo of his mother’s politics. He is something else — sharper, angrier, and far more unfiltered.He does not walk in his mother’s ideological footsteps. Sometimes he sprints ahead of them. Sometimes he walks sideways. Sometimes he blows the path up entirely.That is why people keep searching: they want to know how someone with this lineage ended up building his own ideological vocabulary so young.He studied political science.By all accounts, he enjoyed the subject not as academic theory but as ammunition. His worldview isn’t shaped by textbooks; it is shaped by his belief that his generation was left to pick up the economic bill for mistakes they never made.His politics sound less like seminar chatter and more like a frustrated audit of the nation.He is 24.Old enough to be articulate.Young enough to be impatient.Exactly the age where American politicians historically start developing their first serious ideological identity.And unlike his peers, who often bury their politics under irony and detachment, Nalin expresses his with startling clarity.His ancestry is Indian, through his maternal grandparents.But Nalin himself rejects the label. He doesn’t romanticise it. He doesn’t use it. He doesn’t even politely gesture towards it for cultural diplomacy.He insists that he is American — full stop.Not Indian-American. Not part-something. Not hyphenated.This self-positioning has made him a lightning rod: an Indian-origin young American who refuses the script that others assume he should perform.Yes.In 2025, he entered the Catholic Church after a long period of spiritual confusion that came from navigating a home shaped by Christian parents and Sikh grandparents.Unlike his politics, which are sharp-edged and confrontational, his religious turn is quiet, personal, and unusually sincere. It is one of the few areas where he does not perform for an audience.Because he represents a generational shift that both parties ignored.He talks like someone who grew up watching the American Dream evaporate into student loans, unaffordable housing, and political polarisation that never once benefited people his age.He rejects inherited identities.He questions every established norm.He pushes against his own family’s political comfort zone.He is not trying to become the next face of MAGA or the next campus conservative icon. He is voicing a generational grievance — and doing it with unusual clarity for someone his age.Whether people agree with him or not is irrelevant.The point is that they cannot stop looking him up.If you want, I can now write a more dramatic version, a cleaner news-feature version, or a Weekend Vine-style roast of the phenomenon called Nalin Haley.","Nalin Haley is a 24-year-old American political voice who grew up in a family that straddled multiple identities.

"Turkeys pardoned, Democrats roasted: How Trump turned Thanksgiving into political spectacle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/turkeys-pardoned-democrats-roasted-how-trump-turned-thanksgiving-into-political-spectacle/articleshow/125659023.cms,"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump, stand next to national Thanksgiving turkey Gobble during a pardoning ceremony

(By arrangement with The American Bazaar)





Donald the merciful was in a forgive, but not forget mood as he bestowed “unconditional” pardons on Gobble and Waddle, two pampered Thanksgiving turkeys, at the traditional White House ritual as he roasted his foes.But some turkeys cannot be pardoned as all birds are not created equal, he suggested launching a seemingly endless harangue against birds of Democratic feather before getting down to the business at hand.When he first saw the birds he thought they should be named Chuck and Nancy — after Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — POTUS revealed, but “I would never pardon those people” not caring for First Lady Melania’s plea to be nice.Claiming that last year’s turkey pardons issued by “sleepy Joe Biden ,” were invalid because he used an autopen, he asked, “Where’s Hunter?” suggesting his predecessor’s son could once again be in legal trouble.He even joked about sending the retired turkeys to an infamous prison in El Salvador that has been used to house migrants deported from the United States.Trump chose Black Friday to strike again to cancel “all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden.”“Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect,” he declared on his Truth Social mouthpiece.“The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office,” he alleged, “took the Presidency away from him,” by signing his name using an autopen – a device commonly used by US presidents, including Trump in the past.“Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury,” he warned. But it wasn’t clear how Trump would actually nullify Biden’s pardons and executive orders.Earlier at the roast, Trump didn’t mention two other turkeys he would never pardon — former FBI director James Comey and New York attorney general Letitia James — as a federal judge tossed cases against them saying the prosecuting attorney was illegally appointed.The Justice Department is bound to appeal and try again to charge Comey and James, who had claimed the prosecutions were politically motivated, pointing to Trump’s public demands to punish his enemies.Despite facing judicial obstacles, Trump “has other options for pursuing and penalizing those he perceives to have crossed or undermined him,” noted the New York Times suggesting he was flexing full executive power against his foes.Meanwhile, Trump scored a major victory as a judge in Georgia dismissed the last pending criminal prosecution against the president, effectively ending efforts to hold him criminally responsible for attempts to overturn the 2020 election.Trump has now seen three criminal cases against him dissolve since he was re-elected last year. The Georgia case was seen as one of the most serious legal threats to Trump, because state criminal convictions are not subject to presidential pardons.Trump was quick to go to town over the dismissal of “this Illegal, Unconstitutional, and unAmerican Hoax… at the direction of Crooked Joe Biden and his ‘Handlers,’ in their obsession with doing anything and everything to ‘GET TRUMP.’”Even as he accused “The Deranged Democrats” of having “weaponized our Law Enforcement and Justice System against HONEST AND LOVING Americans,” his FBI summoned a group of Democratic lawmakers whom Trump had branded ‘traitors’ for calling on troops to disobey unlawful orders.Among other turkeys not deserving Trump’s pardon were “The Creeps at the Failing New York Times,” who had found “signs of fatigue in Trump's trademark stamina” suggesting that at 79, he was starting the day later and holding fewer events.Accusing “the Radical Left Lunatics in the soon to fold New York Times” for doing “a hit piece on me that I am perhaps losing my Energy, despite facts that show the exact opposite,” he branded the venerated old lady of New York a “cheap RAG” and “truly an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”“The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” he wrote insulting a female reporter for the third time in recent weeks.Later he furiously called yet another female reporter a “stupid person” after being asked about an Afghan man suspected of shooting two national guard troops near the White House.Pointing out that the Afghan shooter, who had worked with a CIA-backed military unit in Afghanistan, was granted asylum by the Trump administration in April 2025 after “thorough vetting,” she asked, “So why do you blame the Biden administration?”“Because they let them in,” Trump snapped. “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn’t be here, and you’re just asking questions, because you’re a stupid person.”Dismissing the whole episode as “FAKE NEWS,” the White House’s official RapidResponse 47 X account proudly posted the exchange on social media.Earlier this month, Trump lashed out at a Bloomberg reporter who asked him about the Epstein files, responding with “quiet, quiet, piggy” while pointing his finger at her.Meanwhile, using the shooting in Washington, Trump ordered reexamination of all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” listed in a June presidential proclamation.“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,” Trump thundered on Truth Social saying “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”Trump also “retruthed” without context several posts from his followers depicting him as a warrior against the “Deep State” with one showing him as a king in full body armor with an ominous warning: “NONE shall escape his justice!” - Thanksgiving or no thanksgiving!","President Donald Trump pardoned Gobble and Waddle, two pampered Thanksgiving turkeys, at the traditional White House ritual as he roasted his foes.

A source claimed that former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dating pop star Katy Perry solely for fame or to improve his public appeal after his political life went downhill. The insider suggested that Trudeau benefits more from the romantic relationship than Perry herself.“People have been fascinated with Katy for years, and they’re always going to be curious about what she does next,” the source told Star Magazine.The insider added: “Not so with Justin. He’s a nepo baby who flamed out in his political career and doesn’t have much of a path forward without his celebrity status.”“Justin doesn’t have much of a path forward without his celebrity status.” The source added, “Dating Katy has made him more famous, in a positive way, and he doesn’t want this trend to stop…It’s absolutely key to his survival as a public figure.”According to the insider, Trudeau “needs this relationship way more than Katy does, and everybody around her knows that.” They added: “Katy doesn’t want or need any more of that stuff, but it’s Justin’s lifeblood and the only thing that’s keeping him relevant.”The romance between 40-year-old Katy Perry and 53-year-old Justin Trudeau has been quietly developing for months. Photos of the couple aboard Perry’s yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara went viral in October, showing the duo hugging, kissing, and sharing intimate moments. Perry was seen in a black swimsuit while Trudeau was shirtless, wearing a jeans.Also read: Justin Trudeau had been 'pursuing' Katy Perry since July; source reveals he 'even flew to California' as yacht pictures go viral The People reported that Trudeau had been pursuing Katy since their first date in July 2025. “When she first hung out with Justin, she wasn’t looking to date, but they stayed in touch. They have many shared interests and a lot to talk about, but Katy was navigating too many things to even think about dating then,” the insider said. Trudeau reportedly flew to California during a tour break to see Perry, and the source added, “They have an easy connection. She finds him attractive. He’s been very respectful.”Most recently, Katy and Justin were spotted on a date in Paris, leaving the club Crazy Horse. Perry wore a red dress, while Trudeau wore a black suit.The couple first sparked rumours when they were spotted dining together at Le Violon restaurant in Montreal. Trudeau split from his wife Sophie Grégoire in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage, and they share three children. Perry has a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove, with actor Orlando Bloom, and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand.","Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dating pop star Katy Perry solely for fame or to improve his public appeal.

Trump ORDERS Military Action Against Venezuela; U.S. Forces Close In As Maduro Vows Resistance





US President Donald Trump has declared that the airspace above and around Venezuela is “closed in its entirety,” amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas.""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump had said earlier this week that the United States is preparing new measures against alleged drug-trafficking networks in Venezuela, telling service members during a Thanksgiving call that operations involving ground strikes would begin “very soon.”“In recent weeks, you’ve been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many. Of course, there aren’t too many coming in by sea anymore,” Trump said, as cited by CNN.Trump added that fewer shipments were coming in by sea and said the US would soon move to block trafficking routes on land as well, calling those operations “easier” and set to begin “very soon.” He warned alleged traffickers to “stop sending poison” into the United States.Earlier this week, Trump also designated Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his close associates as part of a foreign terrorist organization.The move labels the so-called “Cartel de los Soles”, a term experts say refers more to allegedly corrupt officials than to a structured criminal group, as a foreign terrorist entity, giving Trump expanded authority to impose new sanctions on Maduro’s assets and infrastructure, as cited by CNN.The United States has deployed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops to the region under what the Pentagon calls “Operation Southern Spear.” As part of this anti–drug trafficking campaign, US forces have carried out boat strikes that have resulted in more than 80 deaths.Last week, the US aviation regulator cautioned major airlines about a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela, citing a deteriorating security landscape and increased military activity in the area.In response, Venezuela revoked operating rights for six major international airlines that had halted flights after the FAA issued its warning.","US President Donald Trump has declared that the airspace above and around Venezuela is “closed in its entirety,” amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Pakistan Erupts As Imran Khan’s Son Claims ‘No Proof Of Life’ Amid CM Afridi's Jail-Side Protest.'Darkest period' in Pakistan, says sister Noreen Niazi.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves.

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here.

Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours





The Adiala Jail administration on Wednesday dismissed rumours and confirmed that former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan remains inside the Rawalpindi prison and is in good health.This comes amid growing speculation regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s whereabouts.“There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala Jail,” officials said in a statement. They added that Khan was “fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.”The authorities further rejected the claims about any deterioration in his condition, calling it “baseless,” according to Geo TV.The clarification comes at a time when social media has been flooded with unverified claims, including suggestions from accounts based in Pakistan and Afghanistan alleging that Khan had been harmed or killed inside the prison.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces several cases, including corruption and terrorism-related charges. The accusations were filed after he was ousted from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022.Meanwhile, defence minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the former premier was being kept in conditions far more comfortable than those faced by previous prisoners.“Check the menu of the food that comes for him — it is not available even in a five-star hotel,” Asif said.He added that Khan had access to a television, exercise equipment, a double bed and a velvet mattress, according to Geo TV.Recalling his own incarceration, he said, “We slept on cold floors, ate jail food, and had only two blankets in January with no hot water,” accusing PTI leaders of exaggerating Khan’s condition.“Fear God — no one owns time,” the defence minister added.The rumours intensified after Khan’s three sisters were allegedly assaulted by police personnel outside Adiala Jail last week while trying to meet him.Noreen Niazi, one of the sisters, said they were peacefully protesting concerns over Khan’s health when streetlights were “abruptly switched off,” followed by what she described as a “brutal and orchestrated assault.”""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she added.Thousands of PTI supporters later gathered outside the facility, demanding permission to meet Khan and protesting against restrictions imposed by the government, which has reportedly barred visits to the former prime minister for over a month.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was also denied multiple requests to meet Khan, a decision the PTI alleges is influenced by security forces.",Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month, marking a significant boost to connectivity between the two countries, Bangladesh’s ambassador to Pakistan announced on Wednesday.There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bangladesh — formerly East Pakistan — became independent after the India-Pakistan war of December 1971. Bilateral relations, long shaped by this history, have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.“Mahan Air will begin operating three weekly flights between Dhaka and Karachi from next month,” Bangladesh’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Iqbal Hussain Khan said. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s capital and largest city, while Karachi is Pakistan’s biggest metropolis; both rank among the world’s most populated urban centres.Khan did not specify the exact launch date or share further operational details.He also highlighted that the visa process has been simplified. “Visas are now being issued on the joint recommendation of Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) and the Bangladesh Honorary Consulate in Lahore,” he noted.Travellers can expect visas within three to four days, he added, describing the change as a step that will make cross-border movement faster and more convenient.The envoy emphasised that the new air links “will be a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries.”Mahan Airlines, which operates as Mahan Air, is a privately owned Iranian carrier. In addition, two Pakistani private airlines — Fly Jinnah and AirSial — have already received approval from Bangladesh’s aviation authorities to commence direct flights.Khan also disclosed that a direct cargo shipping service will be launched soon. “Although a cargo service has been operational since last December, rising trade volumes now demand a dedicated direct route,” he explained.Relations between the two countries have warmed in recent months. Following the August 5, 2024 ouster of Sheikh Hasina amid widespread student-led protests, and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dhaka and Islamabad have increased engagement across multiple fronts."," direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month.

TL;DR Driving the news

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes

What changed: The 27th Amendment





Passed in five days without broad consultation, the amendment:

Created a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) - removing constitutional jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.

Gave the president power to transfer judges - effectively coercing judicial loyalty.

Handed lifetime immunity to the president and military chiefs - beyond the reach of courts.

Eliminated the post of Chairman Joint Chiefs and established a Chief of Defence Forces - placing all services under Field Marshal Asim Munir.

Why it matters





A civilian-military consolidation of power unseen since the days of General Pervez Musharraf.

The official death of judicial independence, according to resigning justices and legal experts.

A reshuffling of Pakistan's political DNA - where the army writes the script, judges act the scenes, and a veiled mystic, Bushra Bibi , remains a ghost in the wings.

, remains a ghost in the wings. “We are facing completely uncharted territory,” warned constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan.

The big picture: A triangle of power





Field Marshal Asim Munir: commander of all armed services, architect of the new order.

Imran Khan: jailed, disqualified, but symbolically invincible.

Bushra Bibi: spiritual advisor-turned-political wife, whose journey from Pakpattan to Islamabad may yet reshape the battlefield.

Together - or more accurately, against each other - they define Pakistan’s struggle between civilian populism, military dominance, and spiritual mysticism.

The new triumvirate: The general, the pirni & the cricketer





Asim Munir: The new pharaoh

All armed services via the new title Chief of Defence Forces

The nuclear command (transferred from civilians)

His own legal protection, via lifetime immunity

Parliament, by proxy of pliant coalitions

“Field marshals don't retire. They may leave a post, but they remain field marshal for life.” Shuja Nawaz on Munir

Imran Khan: Popularity in captivity





His party, despite rigging, won 93 out of 266 seats in 2024 elections.

His speeches are censored, yet his words circulate like sacred scripture.

His rivals - from Shehbaz Sharif to Zardari - struggle to match his moral authority.

Bushra Bibi: The mystic in the mirror





Predicted Khan’s rise to power - prompting their 2018 secret marriage.

Selected cabinet appointments by reading photographs.

The ISI angle





Bushra behind bars





Unlawful marriage (violating the Islamic waiting period)

Saudi gifts corruption scandal

Land deal redirection for an Islamic university

Yet none of these - even when supported by leaked audios and courtroom theatrics - have cracked public perception.

“Bushra has not made herself my weakness,” Khan said from his cell. “Her bravery has made me stronger.”

Between the lines





This is not just a crisis of governance - it’s a recasting of Pakistan’s founding vision.

From constitutional democracy to executive-military command

From judicial review to judicial obedience

From public representation to spiritual symbolism

What’s next





Munir had been due to retire in 2027. Now, he is set to oversee the 2028 elections, installing loyalist judges and neutering opposition.

What if Khan compromises - freeing himself and Bushra in exchange for political silence.

Then there is the risk of popular backlash erupting-driven by youth, lawyers, and civil society.

For now, the regime holds the cards. But as with every overreach in Pakistan’s history - from Zia to Musharraf - backlash often comes not as revolution, but as decay.

Bottom line





The Field Marshal cannot be arrested

The Supreme Court cannot speak

The President cannot be questioned

And the people’s vote barely matters





On paper, the 27th Constitutional Amendment is 59 clauses of dense legalese. In practice, it reads like a character study of three people: a jailed former cricket hero, his mystic wife, and a general-turned-field marshal who now enjoys lifetime immunity.On November 14, 2025, Pakistan enacted the 27th Constitutional Amendment - a sweeping legal overhaul that granted lifetime immunity to President Asif Ali Zardari and Field Marshal Asim Munir , while transforming the judiciary into an executive-led structure.Two Supreme Court judges resigned. Opposition parties stormed out of Parliament. And somewhere in a prison cell in Adiala, Imran Khan , Pakistan’s most popular politician, began writing a letter - alone, without books or newspapers.“Parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” said legal analyst Mirza Moiz Baig.“This is autocratic legalism,” warned Aqil Shah of Georgetown University. “In no other democracy is the army chief of staff the designated joint service chief,” Shah told AFP.The 27th Amendment isn’t just constitutional tinkering. It represents:In a scathing editorial, Dawn argued that “with this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan - which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation - now stands terminated.”It noted the irony that “instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch. ”“The funeral rites for the judiciary have been performed,” said the editorial.Pakistan’s new regime is no longer about parties. It’s now a triumvirate:Munir rose through the ranks as quartermaster general and Corps Commander Gujranwala, then as head of Military Intelligence and, eventually, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 2019 he was removed as intelligence chief “just eight months into his stint, under then-prime minister Imran Khan and for reasons that have never been made public.”That sacking is widely seen in Pakistan as the first major clash between Munir and Imran Khan.Now elevated to Field Marshal, Asim Munir controls:“He probably has as much power as Musharraf,” said military analyst Shuja Nawaz. “Like Musharraf, he has a subservient prime minister and the authority to reshape the army's structure,” Nawaz told AFP.And unlike Musharraf, Munir doesn’t wear the scars of a military coup - he wears constitutional legitimacy.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan - held in solitary confinement, his party symbol banned, and facing dozens of legal cases - still commands unmatched national support.“He is still seen as Pakistan’s moral sovereign,” noted a leading historian.But behind bars, choices are narrowing. Some in PTI want compromise. Bushra Bibi, too, is reportedly inclined toward negotiation.As per a profile of Bushra Bibi in the Economist, by the mid-2010s, Imran Khan was at a personal and political low. Then came the introduction to Bushra Manika, a middle-aged woman from Punjab with a reputation as a Sufi-inclined spiritual guide. Their relationship began with late-night phone calls, before turning into visits to her family home in Pakpattan. According to 1843, Bushra’s then-husband, Khawar Manika, initially enjoyed the glamour but became uneasy as his wife’s intimacy with Khan grew. He recalled asking: “Why can’t we sit together?” and described walking into rooms to find conversations abruptly cut short.Manika later told 1843 that his wife had shared a prophecy with Khan: if they married, he would become prime minister. She divorced Manika at the end of 2017 and married Khan in a secret ceremony on January 1st 2018. Khan later told a British newspaper, “Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife.”As per the Economist, few first ladies in modern history have combined veiled mysticism, political access, and whispered intrigue quite like Bushra Bibi.Once a pirni from Pakpattan, she:“Her interference was absolute,” a member of Imran Khan’s cabinet told the Economist.“He cannot see beyond that Sufi halo she carries around her,” added close friend Salman Ahmad.Per the Economist’s reporting, ISI officers allegedly used a pir to funnel intelligence to Bushra, who then passed it to Khan as revelations from dreams - reinforcing her mystical power and his trust in her.“Faiz was feeding information to Bushra Bibi through her pir,” confirmed ex-ally Faisal Vawda.“That’s how Khan started getting blinded.”But what the spy agency built, it later dismantled. When Khan sacked Asim Munir as ISI chief in 2019, allegedly after he raised corruption concerns about Bushra, the seeds of retaliation were planted.Bushra Bibi now shares Khan’s fate - imprisoned, silenced, and at the center of three separate cases:“No ordinary Pakistani will remain unaffected,” Dawn warned.“When the state is tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizen will lose every time.”This crisis leaves Pakistan at a crossroads:This isn’t just about one amendment, or one general, or one mystic wife. It’s about a state remade in secret, then rubber-stamped in Parliament, where:But still, whispers from prison echo across Pakistan - from Khan’s letters to Bushra’s mysticism and protests.(With inputs from agencies)",The 27th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution was passed in five days without broad consultation.

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes





Pakistan’s military on Tuesday rejected accusations from the Taliban government that it carried out airstrikes inside Afghanistan, where an overnight raid reportedly killed 10 people near the Durand Line.“Pakistan has not attacked Afghanistan,” army spokesperson lieutenant general Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on state broadcaster PTV, calling the Afghan administration’s allegations “baseless.”“Whenever Pakistan attacks someone, it announces it,” Sharif Chaudhry said.He further added, ""In our view, there are no good and bad Taliban.""Afghanistan, however, strongly condemned Pakistan for strikes in Paktika, Khost and Kunar provinces, calling them a direct violation of its sovereignty and a breach of international norms. The Taliban government said it would respond “at an appropriate time.”Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan’s “hostile actions” reflected the “ongoing failures of Pakistan’s military regime,” adding that defending Afghanistan’s airspace, territory and citizens was its “legitimate right.”",Pakistan’s military on Tuesday rejected accusations from the Taliban government that it carried out airstrikes inside Afghanistan.

Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency on Saturday and sought international assistance as the death toll from Cyclone Ditwah’s rains and floods climbed to 132, with 176 people still missing.The extreme weather system has destroyed more than 15,000 homes and forced 78,000 people into state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said, as cited by AFP.President Anura Kumara Dissanayake invoked emergency laws, giving him broad authority to respond to the devastation after a week of torrential rain across the island.“We have 132 confirmed dead and another 176 missing,” DMC Director-General Sampath Kotuwegoda said. He also noted that relief operations have been reinforced with deployments from the army, navy and air force.Although the cyclone was moving north toward neighbouring India on Saturday, fresh landslides struck the central district of Kandy, 115 km (70 miles) east of Colombo, submerging several sections of the main access road.Meanwhile, flooding worsened in low-lying areas, prompting authorities to order evacuations for residents along the Kelani River, which flows from Colombo into the Indian Ocean.While rain eased across most of the country, including the capital, the northern regions continued to experience showers from the lingering effects of the cyclone.The government called for international assistance and urged Sri Lankans abroad to contribute cash donations to aid nearly half a million people affected by the disaster.India responded quickly, sending two planeloads of relief supplies, while an Indian warship already in Colombo on a goodwill visit donated its rations to support victims.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, expressed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka, mourning the lives lost in the cyclone and reaffirming India’s support for its “closest maritime neighbour.” He highlighted that India had promptly sent relief supplies and critical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) equipment as part of the operation.The cyclone is Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when floods and landslides claimed over 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands.","Sri Lanka declares state of emergency as death toll from Cyclone Ditwah climbs to 132.

Cyclone Ditwah Approaches India: Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh Brace For Impact





COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday grappled with one of its worst disasters as cyclonic storm Ditwah wreaked havoc, causing floods and landslides that left more than 80 dead, amid a trail of destruction and damage to infrastructure.India launched 'Operation Sagar Bandhu' to assist Sri Lanka in its hour of crisis, and the first tranche of relief materials was handed over after the consignments were transported by the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline ship INS Udaigiri to the island nation.The relief came as Sri Lankan authorities warned of an ""unprecedented disaster situation"" in the Western Province from Friday night due to rising water levels in the Kelani and Attanagalu rivers.Both Colombo and the next most populous district of Gampaha are under severe threat, prompting officials to urge residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate, they said.Late on Friday, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed more than 80 people have died, while 34 remain missing in the past three days, as rescue operations intensify, according to news portal NewsFirst.lk.The DMC said as many as 1,48,603 individuals from 44,192 families were suffering due to widespread flooding, while 5,024 families (approximately 14,000 people) had taken shelter in 195 emergency centres.Scores of houses were destroyed completely or partially, leaving thousands homeless as Cyclone Ditwah unleashed torrential rainfall, triggering extensive flooding, landslides in central hill regions and major disruptions in other parts that have left several areas inaccessible.""It is unlikely this situation will change. We expect the Kelani River's water levels to exceed those recorded during the 2016 floods,"" Director General Ajith Gunasekara told reporters.He urged residents in vulnerable locations to secure essential items, including educational certificates, vehicle documents and valuables, before relocating to safer ground.The central Matale district recorded the highest rainfall in the 24 hours ending 6 am Thursday, receiving 540 mm, authorities said.Three major bridges - Moragahakanda Main Bridge, Elahera Bridge, and Kumara Ella Bridge - were washed away, cutting off vital transport routes and isolating communities in Matale, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, and Uva provinces, all routes crucial for trade, agriculture, and relief convoys.The disaster management officials said that the severity of the weather has significantly hindered the ability of officials to reach affected sites or carry out on-ground assessments and rescue efforts.The Irrigation Department issued a further warning that the Kelani river is approaching historically high flood levels, posing a severe risk to Colombo and surrounding areas for the next two days, the news portal said.Severe weather has also caused widespread power outages, affecting 25 to 30 per cent of the region.Two major hydropower plants, Kotmale and Rantambe, were shut down after a power cable failure, said Shirley Kumara, general manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board.As of 5:30 pm Friday, the cyclonic storm Ditwah lay centred about 40 kilometres west-northwest of Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka, officials said, adding, it was moving north-northwest, dumping massive rainfall.The Indian High Commission, in a statement, said New Delhi has so far provided 4.5 tonnes of dry rations and 2 tonnes of fresh rations, including staple foods, packaged and ready-to-eat items, dairy and bakery products, beverages, and other nutritional essentials.Additional survival supplies have also been handed over, it said.Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) described the current situation as ""extraordinary and unprecedented"" and warned that landslides could occur at any moment in any mountainous region due to the prevailing severe weather conditions.The director of the NBRO's Landslide Research Division told local media that landslides can occur when rainfall exceeds 150 mm within 24 hours. ""Several mountainous areas have (already) received more than 500 mm of rainfall during the past 24 hours,"" he said on Friday afternoon.""The total rainfall during the past 10 days is close to 1,000 mm. This situation is unlike anything we have ever experienced,"" he said.Earlier in the day, a diplomatic briefing was held at the Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya's office, and attended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, Vijitha Herath.The Colombo-based Heads of Mission were updated on the Sri Lankan government's ongoing emergency flood relief operations and recovery measures, and they were told that the government has designated an officer to handle inquiries regarding foreign tourists affected by the current disaster situation, according to the PM's Office.According to local media, several important examinations were postponed due to the precarious flood situation, authorities announced.In response to the disaster caused by Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake invoked powers under the Essential Public Services Act, declaring a wide range of services as ""essential"" to the life of the community reeling under severe adverse weather conditions.These services include electricity supply; supply or distribution of petroleum products, fuel, including gas; hospitals, water supply, and public transport.All long-distance express, intercity, and night mail trains on every railway line were cancelled, with several train services resuming on Friday evening only within the Western Province, according to railway authorities.","India launches 'Operation Sagar Bandhu' to assist Sri Lanka in its hour of crisis.

Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term





A Bangladesh court on Thursday sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina to 21 years in prison in three corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in land allocations under a government housing project.The verdict adds to the mounting legal troubles facing Hasina, who is already under a separate death sentence for her role in last year’s violent crackdown.Judge Mohammad Abdullah Al Mamun of Dhaka’s Special Judge Court-5 sentenced Hasina to three separate seven-year prison terms in corruption cases linked to the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal, bringing the total to 21 years to be served consecutively.He also fined her Taka one lakh in each case, with an additional 18 months in jail if the fines are not paid.The court also sentenced Hasina’s son, Sajib Wajed Joy, and daughter, Saima Wazed Putul, to five years in prison each in related cases involving the same housing project. Both were fined Taka one lakh, with a one-month default sentence for non-payment.""The plot was allotted to Sheikh Hasina without any application and in a manner that exceeded the legally authorised jurisdiction,"" Judge Mamun said while delivering the sentence, as cited by PTI.The latest verdict comes just 10 days after a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death in absentia for “crimes against humanity” linked to her government’s violent crackdown on student-led protests last year.She has rejected all allegations, insisting the charges are “biased and politically motivated.”Hasina has been living in exile in New Delhi since August 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh at the end of her 15-year rule. The Ministry of External Affairs said on Wednesday that Dhaka’s request for her extradition is currently under examination.Dhaka has repeatedly requested New Delhi to extradite the leader of the banned Awami League party, but India is not automatically required to comply. Under the 2013 extradition treaty, requests can be refused if the offence is considered “political” or if extradition would be “unjust or oppressive.”","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 21 years in prison in three corruption cases.

Direct flights between Pak and B'desh from Dec





DHAKA: Anti-corruption authorities in Bangladesh have seized about 10 kilograms of gold worth about $1.3 million from bank lockers belonging to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , officials aware of development said Wednesday.Officials from the Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) of the national board of revenue said the discovery was made after opening lockers that had been seized in Sept. ""Following a court order, we opened the lockers and found about 9.7 kilograms of gold belonging to the former prime minister,"" a CIC official said, requesting anonymity. The haul included gold coins, bars and jewellery.Investigators said Hasina had failed to deposit some of the gifts she received while in office at the state treasury, known as ""Toshakhana"", as required by law. The national board of revenue is also probing alleged tax evasion and examining whether the former prime minister declared the recovered gold in her tax filings.Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will begin from next month, a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries, Dhaka's top diplomat said Wednesday.

LONDON: ""What's it about?"" was a frequent response from bemused theatre-goers to ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"", Tom Stoppard's first stage triumph. Tired of being asked, Stoppard is said to have replied to a woman outside a theatre on Broadway: ""It's about to make me very rich. ""He later questioned whether he had said ""very"", Hermione Lee writes in Stoppard's authorised biography, but he had undoubtedly managed to transform his previously precarious finances.For every puzzled spectator, there were many more ecstatic fans and critics, dazzled by the wit, brilliant wordplay and sheer daring of a young playwright who had turned Shakespeare inside out and placed the spotlight, not on the eponymous Hamlet, but on two minor characters from the same play.First performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966, the following year, ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" made Stoppard, at the age of 29, the youngest playwright to be staged at the National Theatre in London. From there, the play went to Broadway and had more than 250 productions worldwide over its first decade.Stoppard's career flourished for decades more, embracing stage, screen and radio, and demonstrating his thirst to tackle any subject -- from mathematics to Dadaist art to landscape gardening.Stoppard's many other successes included ""The Real Inspector Hound"", which parodied stage whodunnits and sent up theatre critics, ""Jumpers"", a 1.5 million word epic that delighted and confused its public, and ""Night and Day"", a satire on the British media.His densely packed, intricately constructed plays were based on extensive research. ""Arcadia"", in 1993, considered by many critics to be his masterpiece, blended chaos theory, Isaac Newton and the poet Lord Byron's love life.The word Stoppardian, first recorded in 1978, meanwhile entered the Oxford English Dictionary. It refers to the use of verbal gymnastics while addressing philosophical concepts. The honours he won included an Oscar for co-authoring the screenplay of the 1998 hit film ""Shakespeare in Love"", and a record five Tony awards for Best Play.He died at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family, his agent said Saturday.Stoppard was born Tomas Straussler on July 3, 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia, the son of Eugen Straussler, a doctor, and Marta (or Martha), nee Beckova, who had trained as a nurse. The Jewish family fled the Nazis and moved to Singapore when he was an infant. Singapore in turn became unsafe. With his mother and elder brother Peter, he escaped to India. His father stayed behind and died while fleeing after Singapore fell to the Japanese.In India, Marta Straussler married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, and the family moved to England.Boarding school followed at Pocklington in Yorkshire, where Tom Stoppard loved cricket more than drama and learned how to be British, which Major Stoppard considered the ultimate nationality.The adult Stoppard, who rediscovered decades later the Jewish roots that he explored in his final play, would accuse his stepfather of ""an innate antisemitism"".","""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" made Tom Stoppard the youngest playwright to be staged at the National Theatre in London. His densely packed, intricately constructed plays were based on extensive research. He won an Oscar for co-authoring the screenplay of the 1998 hit film ""Shakespeare in Love"", and a record five Tony awards for Best Play.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125667605,imgsize-558171,width-400,resizemode-4/tom-stoppard.jpg"

Trump tariffs





TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was clinging on Monday even after his coalition disastrously lost its upper house majority, as painful new US tariffs loom.The Liberal democratic party (LDP), which has governed almost continuously since 1955, and its partner Komeito had to win 50 seats in Sunday's election but they fell three short, national broadcaster NHK reported.Voters angry at inflation turned to other parties, notably the ""Japanese first"" Sanseito, which made strong gains with its ""anti-globalist"" drive echoing the agenda of populist parties elsewhere.""I even think (the LDP) should have lost more,"" 25-year-old Kazuyo Nanasawa, who voted for a small ultra-conservative party, told AFP, adding that Ishiba should quit.The debacle comes only months after Ishiba's coalition was forced into a minority government in the more powerful lower house, in the LDP's worst result in 15 years.But asked late Sunday if he intended to remain in office, Ishiba told local media: ""That's right.""""The deadline of (US) tariffs is coming on August 1. Until then we have to do our best with our body and soul,"" he said.If Ishiba does go, it was unclear who might step up to replace him now that the government needs opposition support in both chambers to pass legislation.LDP supporter Takeshi Nemoto, 80, told AFP that a new leadership contest ""would be a losing battle"" for the party, further complicating tariff talks with US President Donald Trump's administration.""Diplomacy is under pressure at the moment,"" agreed Shuhei Aono, 67. ""Who is going to take care of it? I think (Ishiba) cannot easily withdraw.""The election saw 125 seats in the 248-seat upper house contested.The coalition needed 50 of those but local media reported they only won 47, with the LDP winning 39 and Komeito eight, giving them 122 deputies.Second-placed was the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), which won 22 contested seats, followed by the Democratic Party For the People (DPP) with 17.The right-wing Sanseito party won 14 seats.Sanseito wants ""stricter rules and limits"" on immigration, opposes ""radical"" gender policies, and wants a rethink on decarbonisation and vaccines.It was forced last week to deny any links to Moscow -- which has backed populist parties elsewhere -- after a candidate was interviewed by Russian state media.The opposition is fragmented, and chances are slim that the parties can form an alternative government, Hidehiro Yamamoto, politics and sociology professor at the University of Tsukuba, told AFP.Expanding the coalition would be difficult, with the DPP the most likely partner ""on the condition that (the government) delivers some of the positive fiscal measures, such as tax cuts,"" he said.More likely is that Ishiba will continue needing opposition support on a case-by-case basis to pass legislation.In return the opposition could press for consumption tax to be cut or abolished, something which Ishiba has opposed in view of Japan's colossal national debts of over 200 percent of gross domestic product.After years of stagnant or falling prices, consumers in the world's fourth-largest economy have been squeezed by inflation since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.In particular, the price of rice has doubled, squeezing many household budgets despite government handouts.Not helping is lingering resentment about an LDP funding scandal, and US tariffs of 25 percent due to bite from August 1 if there is no trade deal with the United States.Japanese imports are already subject to a 10 percent tariff, while the auto industry, which accounts for eight percent of jobs, is reeling from a 25 percent levy.Despite Ishiba securing an early meeting with Trump in February, there has been no trade accord. On Monday tariffs envoy Ryosei Akazawa left on his eighth visit to Washington.""There's no impact from the election result (on the negotiations),"" Akazawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport, saying that Japan's national interest remained the ""top priority.""","Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba clinging to office after coalition loses majority in upper house.

Is Yellowstone’s supervolcano about to erupt?

Are hydrothermal changes a cause for concern?

What scientists expect before a real eruption

A sharp increase in earthquake frequency and magnitude

Broad and rapid ground uplift

Elevated emissions of volcanic gases like sulphur dioxide

Unusual heat patterns across large areas

The reality of Yellowstone’s eruption cycle

Final word: Yellowstone remains safe





Yellowstone National Park has once again become the centre of global attention, not because of its geysers or wildlife, but due to viral social media claims suggesting an imminent supervolcano eruption. A widely circulated video appears to show a group of bears “fleeing” the park, stirring alarm across platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Users speculated that the animals were reacting to seismic activity beneath the surface. However, scientific evidence and expert monitoring tell a very different story. As of July 2025, the US Geological Survey and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory report no signs of impending volcanic unrest. Here’s a closer look at what’s really happening beneath Yellowstone’s surface — and what isn’t.The now-viral bear video, which triggered fears of an impending eruption, has been thoroughly debunked.Contrary to claims, the footage was not filmed in Yellowstone. It originated in January 2025 at Bear Country USA, a wildlife park in Rapid City, South Dakota. Wildlife experts confirm that the bears shown were part of a controlled, fenced environment and were not exhibiting unusual behaviour.Animal migrations in Yellowstone show no signs of panic. Experts note that bears and other animals tend to follow seasonal patterns, and there’s been no verified mass exodus from the park. Authorities urge the public to verify facts before sharing panic-driven posts online.The Yellowstone supervolcano remains at background levels of activity.According to the USGS and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, the volcano alert level is NORMAL, and the aviation colour code is GREEN. These designations indicate that seismic and geothermal activity are within expected norms.In June 2025, 60 small earthquakes were recorded in the region. The largest measured magnitude 2.7 — well within Yellowstone's historical patterns and not linked to heightened volcanic risk. Regular geothermal features such as geysers and hot springs continue to operate without any unusual changes.Hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone is dynamic and constantly changing.Events like a new hydrothermal vent forming in Biscuit Basin (July 2024) or minor steam explosions are not uncommon. These phenomena result from shallow underground water interactions and do not suggest deeper magma movement.USGS scientists clarify that such changes, while sometimes dramatic, are part of Yellowstone’s geothermal landscape and are not considered precursors to a supervolcano eruption.If Yellowstone were approaching a major eruption, multiple early warning signs would occur.Experts expect precursors like:None of these indicators are currently present. Continuous monitoring through GPS, seismic networks, and gas sensors provides scientists with real-time data capable of detecting any significant changes.The last supervolcanic eruption at Yellowstone occurred around 640,000 years ago.While some speculate on eruption intervals, scientists stress that supervolcanoes do not follow predictable schedules. Estimates suggest no such eruption is due for at least another 60,000 years.Recent studies also show the magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is not as full or pressurised as previously believed, further lowering the likelihood of sudden catastrophic activity.Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.The viral bear video was misleading and not filmed in the park. Experts remain vigilant through advanced monitoring systems and have found no signs of escalating volcanic hazard.Yellowstone continues to be a safe destination for visitors, with its geothermal marvels and wildlife providing awe and inspiration — minus the eruption panic.","Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

Clashes In US Senate; 'Are You Afraid Of Trump?': Lawmakers Walk Out Of 'Kangaroo Court' Hearing





• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.","Donald Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Jeffrey Epstein's plane.

Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

Two lives were tragically cut short on Saturday morning in Manhattan’s Chinatown when a stolen car careered off the road and slammed into a cyclist and a woman on a bench.In a disturbing CCTV footage, a blue Chevy Malibu can be seen speeding through a traffic median at the intersection of Bowery and Canal Streets just after 7:30am.The car struck 55-year-old Kevin Scott Cruickshank, a Chase Bank loan manager and father, who was riding his bicycle, and 63-year-old May Kwok, who had been seated nearby.Kwok was thrown from sight in an instant, while Cruickshank, also a well-known local figure, appeared to be hit head-on. The Malibu, a rental vehicle that had been reported stolen, then crashed into an empty NYPD van moments later, according to the footage seen by the New York Post.The alleged driver, Autumn Donna Ascencio Romero, 23, and passenger Kennedy LaCraft, 22, fled the scene on foot but were apprehended nearby by police. Officers said that drugs and alcohol were discovered inside the car.Romero is already facing an unresolved case in Brooklyn involving a separate crash on 13 April in which a bystander was struck.Cruickshank’s family issued a heartfelt statement confirming his death.“It is with a heavy heart that we confirm that dear friend, neighbor, loving son and husband Kevin Cruickshank has been killed,” the family’s spokesperson told the New York Post.“Kevin was a regular fixture in the neighborhood, known for his warm, welcoming spirit and love of helping his friends and neighbors.""The spokeswoman added that Kevin had a deep love for cycling and was often spotted returning from long rides through the neighbourhood.“It’s heartbreaking to know he lost his life while doing something he truly enjoyed,” she said.May Kwok, the second victim, was remembered by her brother as a “free spirit” who enjoyed walking around the neighbourhood and attending church.The investigation remains ongoing, as authorities piece together what led to the fatal collision.","Kevin Scott Cruickshank, 55, and May Kwok, 63, were killed in Manhattan.

In a remarkable twist of luck, a Massachusetts man won $2 million after unknowingly purchasing two identical Powerball tickets for the same drawing, from two different stores.Paul Corcoran, from Fitchburg in north-central Massachusetts, originally bought a multi-draw Powerball ticket for seven games in the run-up to the July 9 draw, CNN reported.However, thinking the final draw on that ticket had already taken place, Corcoran picked up another seven-draw ticket just minutes away from the first store, inadvertently including the same July 9 draw twice.That simple mistake turned into a fortune.According to the Massachusetts State Lottery and Powerball, both of Corcoran’s tickets matched all five white balls drawn, 5, 9, 25, 28, and 69, earning him $1 million per ticket before taxes. He missed the full $217 million jackpot by just one number, the red Powerball 5.Corcoran told officials he has been playing the same set of random numbers “for quite some time”. He claimed his double prize at the Massachusetts State Lottery headquarters, though said he has no immediate plans for the winnings.The tickets were purchased at two locations: a Market Basket supermarket in Fitchburg and a Country Farms convenience store in nearby Leominster.Both retailers will receive a $10,000 bonus for selling a $1 million winning ticket.According to the lottery office, these were the first $1 million Powerball wins ever recorded in Fitchburg and Leominster, CNN reported.The odds of hitting the Powerball jackpot stand at a staggering 1 in 292.2 million. The next drawing is scheduled for 21 July, with an estimated top prize of $308 million.","Paul Corcoran, from Fitchburg in north-central Massachusetts, originally bought a multi-draw Powerball ticket for seven games in the run-up to the July 9 draw.

(AP)





QUITO: The Ecuadoran government on Sunday extradited notorious drug trafficker Adolfo Macias, alias ""Fito,"" to the United States, a month after he was recaptured following a 2024 escape from a maximum security penitentiary, the country's prison authority said.The US Attorney's Office filed charges in April against Macias, the head of the ""Los Choneros"" gang, on suspicion of cocaine distribution, conspiracy and firearms violations, including weapons smuggling.A letter filed by the US Department of Justice on Sunday said Macias was due to appear in a federal court on Monday ""for an arraignment on the Superseding Indictment in this case.""The drug lord on Sunday was removed from custody at a maximum security prison in Ecuador's southwest ""for the purposes that correspond to the extradition process,"" Ecuador's prison authority SNAI said in a statement to reporters.Macias, a former taxi driver turned crime boss, agreed in a Quito court last week to be extradited to the United States to face the charges.He is the first Ecuadoran extradited by his country since a new measure was written into law last year, after a referendum in which President Daniel Noboa sought the approval of moves to boost his war on criminal gangs.- 'Sooner the better' -Ecuador, once a peaceful haven between the world's two top cocaine exporters Colombia and Peru, has seen violence erupt in recent years as enemy gangs with ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.Soon after Macias escaped from prison in January 2024, Noboa declared Ecuador to be in a state of ""internal armed conflict"" and ordered the military and tanks into the streets to ""neutralize"" the gangs.The move has been criticized by human rights organizations.Macias's Los Choneros has ties to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, Colombia's Gulf Clan -- the world's largest cocaine exporter -- and Balkan mafias, according to the Ecuadorian Organized Crime Observatory.The crime boss' escape from prison prompted widespread violence and a massive military and police recapture operation, including government ""wanted"" posters offering $1 million for information leading to his arrest.On June 25, Macias was found hiding in a bunker concealed under floor tiles in a luxury home in the fishing port of Manta, the center of operations for Los Choneros. Noboa declared he would be extradited, ""the sooner the better.""""We will gladly send him and let him answer to the North American law,"" Noboa told CNN at the time.More than 70 percent of all cocaine produced in the world now passes through Ecuador's ports, according to government data.In 2024, the country seized a record 294 tons of drugs, mainly cocaine.","Ecuador extradites notorious drug trafficker Adolfo Macias, alias ""Fito,"" to the United States.

US' biggest wildfire of the year has consumed over 95,740 acres, according to central Oregon fire authorities on Sunday, with ground teams achieving partial containment of the blaze, which still has potential to expand into a megafire.Officials, quoted by NBC News, revised the Cram Fire's size slightly lower from Saturday after completing more precise mapping. The extensive fire, which has involved more than 900 firefighting personnel, destroyed several homes and led to evacuations across two counties, is now 49% contained following last week's challenging containment efforts.""Yesterday was another favorable day with us with the weather, and so a lot of good work was done,"" Scott Stutzman, operations section chief of the Oregon State Fire Marshal, said Sunday in a Facebook video. ""We'll have those crews out there continuing to maintain a presence mopping up, and also assisting our wildland partners on the perimeter.""The weekend's lower temperatures and increased humidity are forecast to persist into early week, potentially supporting firefighting operations. The fire's extent remains significant: reaching 100,000 acres would classify it as a megafire, marking the first in the USA for 2025, according to Stanton Florea, spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which oversees national wildland firefighting operations.Federal data indicates Oregon experienced six megafires last year.This occurrence, while previously uncommon, has increased in frequency alongside the general expansion and intensification of wildfires.According to Florea, megafires are increasingly frequent, with extended fire seasons - now termed 'fire year' - and more intense, longer-lasting fires.This year has witnessed 40,934 wildfires, the highest count in at least ten years, according to National Interagency Fire Center statistics.A 2023 Congressional Research Service report noted that of 1.6 million wildfires since 2000, only 254 exceeded 100,000 acres, with merely 16 reaching 500,000 acres. ""A small fraction of wildfires become catastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for the vast majority of acres burned,"" the service said, according to NBC. ""For example, about 1% of wildfires become conflagrations — raging, destructive fires — but predicting which fires will 'blow up' into conflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of factors, such as weather and geography. ""Recent studies suggest human-induced global warming increases the likelihood of extreme weather conditions, including extended drought and strong winds. This enables wildfires to ignite unexpectedly and rapidly increase in intensity.The Cram Fire, causing evacuations in Jefferson and Wasco counties, began a week ago, expanding rapidly amid extremely hot, dry and windy western conditions. The cause remains uncertain.While 88 engines and eight helicopters remain deployed to contain the Cram Fire, Sunday's announcement from the Oregon State Fire Marshal indicated plans to adjust their response as containment improves.The fire has destroyed four homes and two additional structures. Officials report reduced threat to residential areas.","Cram Fire in central Oregon has burned 95,740 acres and is 49% contained.

An off-duty US Border Patrol agent was shot and injured late Sunday night in a New York City park beneath the George Washington Bridge. Authorities said one person is in custody and under investigation in connection with the shooting.The officer was reportedly shot in the face during a robbery by a moped-riding suspect in New York City and the officer returned fire, wounding the assailant, reports the New York Post.“Last night, in New York City, an incredible CBP Officer was shot in the face by an Illegal Alien Monster freed into the Country under Joe Biden. He was apprehended at the Border in April 2023 but, instead of being deported, was RELEASED. The CBP Officer bravely fought off his attacker, despite his wounds, demonstrating enormous Skill and Courage,” US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social.The suspect, identified as 21-year-old Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez, a Dominican national, has a long arrest record in New York, according to sources. Despite an existing deportation order, he was reportedly released each time he was taken into custody.Mora reportedly entered the US illegally via the southern border, as per the department of homeland security. When he was apprehended crossing the border, he was released due to overcrowding at a detention facility and given a notice to appear before a judge at a later date.Sources said an immigration judge issued a removal order against him in 2023, as per the New York Post.The shooting took place at approximately 11.51 pm (local time) on Saturday when the 42-year-old federal border patrol agent was sitting in the park with a female companion when they were ambushed by two men on a moped.Following a brief confrontation and struggle, one of the moped-riding suspects opened fire, striking the victim in the face and left forearm.Mora was struck three times by the return fire when the agent drew his pistol and fired multiple rounds at the assailant.The agent was taken to Harlem Hospital where he was recovering as of Sunday and is expected to survive, as per the police, reports ABC News.“Our goal is to get dangerous people off the streets. And we have done that with our federal partners. You know of the number of dangerous gang take downs we’ve participated in. Whatever we need to do in our federal laws to ensure that dangerous people are not on our streets, federal authorities need to do that,” said Mayor Eric Adams.Mora was previously arrested twice within days in August 2024 when he allegedly assaulted a pregnant woman and threatened another migrant with a machete. He was arrested in November 2024 for breaking an order of protection, and in January, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest, as per sources, reports the New York Post.","An off-duty US Border Patrol agent was shot and injured late Sunday night in a New York City park beneath the George Washington Bridge.

A Delta regional jet approaching Minot, North Dakota, was forced to make an ""aggressive maneuver"" to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber, according to the pilot. The incident reportedly took place on July 18, as per the airline.The Delta Airlines flight DL3788, operated by SkyWest, was traveling between Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP) and Minot International Airport (MOT). Minot hosts an Air Force base that operates B-52 bombers.""Given his speed ... I don't know how fast they were going, but they were a lot faster than us, I felt it was the safest thing to do to turn behind it,"" said the pilot once on ground, reports ABC News. ""So sorry about the aggressive maneuver, it caught me by surprise, this is not normal at all. I don't know why they didn't give us a heads up, because the Air Force base does have radar ... long story short, it was not fun, but I do apologize for it and thank you for understanding. Not a not a fun day at work.""The pilot reported that air traffic controllers directed the flight to alter its course because of insufficient separation from another aircraft ahead on the approach path, as per A2Z Aviation.As the crew carried out the instructed course change, they observed a rapidly approaching military aircraft on a converging path. The pilot later explained over the public address system that turning behind the bomber was the safest option as there was no prior warning about military traffic.Passengers seated on the right side of the aircraft reportedly saw the large B-52 bomber up close, intensifying concerns onboard. The pilot stressed that such incidents are extremely rare, particularly considering that Minot Air Force Base is equipped with radar, yet no advisory had been issued about the bomber's presence in the airspace, reports A2Z Aviation.It is still not clear how close the two jets were to each other and if a cockpit alarm was activated warning the pilots about an upcoming collision.“SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Minot, North Dakota, landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path.

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

Baloch Rebels Launch ‘Operation Baam’; 17 Attacks Rock Pakistan’s Balochistan Province





Over the past two days, Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces in Balochistan, reportedly killing at least 27 soldiers, according to The Balochistan Post.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) said its Fateh Squad targeted a military transport bus in Kalat’s Nimargh Cross area, killing 27 troops and injuring several others.The bus was reportedly ferrying personnel from Karachi to Quetta. BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch stated that civilians, including qawwali performers on board, were not intended targets, though Dawn reported three civilian deaths, including two qawwals.In another incident, the BLA claimed to have killed two soldiers and injured seven with a remote-controlled IED in Quetta’s Hazarganji area.The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) also announced two separate operations. On Tuesday, it said an IED blast in Kalat’s Khazina area killed four soldiers. On Wednesday, it claimed to have ambushed a military unit in Awaran’s Gujro Kor area, killing six, including Major Syed Rab Nawaz Tariq from Muzaffarabad.Later, a sniper unit fired upon a nearby military convoy, forcing a retreatThe BLF denied state media reports that three of its ""fighters"" were killed, alleging that Pakistani forces may have staged fake encounters.Balochistan has witnessed a decades-long insurgency by separatist groups seeking independence from Pakistan, with Islamabad claiming the rebellion has been largely suppressed -- a claim challenged by continued militant violence.","Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property. She has not commented since her arrest, and it remains unclear whether she has legal representation. However, before her arrest, she admitted to relationships with at least two monks and a religious academic. She also expressed guilt, saying she had “fallen in love.”Police say 385 million baht (around $11.9 million) passed through Wilawan’s accounts in three years, much of which was spent on online gambling, as per the report.Thailand’s acting Prime Minister has now ordered a review of laws governing monk behaviour and temple finances, amid growing calls for reform.

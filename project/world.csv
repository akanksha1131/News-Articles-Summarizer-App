Trump to head Egypt next

New governing body in Gaza





As the middle peace deal is holding up for the fourth day, Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.This comes as US President Donald Trump is making a flash visit to the region for the peace summit and to celebrate his role in brokering last week's ceasefire and hostage release deal.As per Trump's deal, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 Gaza detainees after Hamas have handed over surviving 20 hostages. According to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel expects all 20 living hostages to be released to the Red Cross ""early Monday morning.""Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.""I think it's going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It's been centuries,"" Trump said.""The war is over. Okay? You understand that?"" he added.In his four hour visit to Israel, Trump is due to meet the families of the hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly cross-border attack two years ago that sparked the war. He will also deliver an address at the Knesset.Prior to his speech, Trump will meet with Netanyahu in the premier’s Knesset office. The two leaders will then meet with families of hostages in the Knesset’s Chagall HallThe timeline is limited by the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which begins on Monday evening, and marks the second anniversary, on the Hebrew calendar, of the Hamas invasion and massacre that launched the war on October 7, 2023.After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza war and promote Middle East peace.Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan -- including Hamas's refusal to disarm and Israel's failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory.Trump insisted he had ""guarantees"" from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages.""I don't think they're going to want to disappoint me,"" he said.Trump also said he would be ""proud"" to visit Gaza itself, but did not say when such a difficult security challenge would be possible.A new governing body for devastated Gaza -- which Trump himself would head under his own plan -- would be established ""very quickly,"" he added.Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel.",Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Protesters clash with police in Ecuador amid nationwide strike over fuel prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/protesters-clash-with-police-in-ecuador-amid-nationwide-strike-over-fuel-prices/articleshow/124515114.cms,"Demonstrators protest President Daniel Noboa's government (Image credits: AP)





QUITO: Crowds protesting a spike in fuel prices spilled into the streets of Ecuador's capital of Quito Sunday, burning tires, blocking roads and facing off against police officers who responded with volleys of tear gas.It was the latest confrontation in a series of nationwide demonstrations testing President Daniel Noboa.Protesters on Sunday whistled and chanted ""Noboa out, out!"" as they marched from southern Quito toward a park further north. Before they could reach the plaza, police officers on motorbikes dispersed the rally, firing tear gas into the crowd. No injuries were immediately reported.Ecuador's largest indigenous organisation called the strikes 21 days ago in response to the removal of a fuel subsidy that raised the price of diesel from $1.80 per gallon to $2.80.The protests have frequently turned violent, with one civilian reported killed so far, dozens injured and over a hundred arrested in clashes with police.Noboa has imposed a state of emergency in 10 provinces, restricting public gatherings in Quito and other areas. Last week, protesters attacked Noboa's motorcade with rocks in a major escalation.As the protests have been largely concentrated in the country's northern provinces, Sunday's rally in Quito put authorities on high alert.Thousands of police in riot gear streamed into the capital in recent days.The latest demonstration coincided with the Day of Interculturality and Plurinationality, Ecuador's replacement for Columbus Day that recognises its indigenous population rather than the Italian explorer's arrival in the Americas in 1492.The hike in fuel prices particularly affects indigenous people who work in Ecuador's crucial agricultural, fishing and transport sectors.President Noboa argues that the government needed to slash the $1.1 billion subsidy to shore up the country's finances and combat rampant fuel smuggling across Ecuador's borders into Colombia and Peru.But the measures drew widespread anger.""The different social sectors, indigenous movement, workers, youth, neighborhoods of Quito, peoples of Ecuador, we are rising up against the neoliberal and hunger-inducing policies of the dictator Noboa,"" Nelson Erazo, a union leader at Sunday's rally, told The Associated Press, referring to the government's subsidy removal and Noboa's other recent cost-cutting measures, like dismissal of thousands of public workers.Noboa has toured several restive regions and provided bonuses to cash-strapped farmers and public transport workers. But he has refused to negotiate with the indigenous federation.","Crowds protest a spike in fuel prices in Ecuador's capital of Quito.

'No Boots On Ground...': Vance Clarifies '200 U.S Troops In Israel' Plan To Monitor Gaza Ceasefire





In a rare moment of bipartisanship, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has praised President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a historic Gaza peace deal that aims to end the two-year war in the region.“I really commend President Trump and his administration,” Clinton said in an interview with CBS News 24/7 on Friday. She also lauded the 20-point peace plan that secured commitments from regional Arab leaders.“Let’s now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,” she added.Clinton’s remarks came a day after Hamas agreed to Trump’s peace proposal in a breakthrough move that drew praise from both Gaza and Israel.The deal provides for the release of the remaining 48 Israeli hostages as early as Monday, alongside a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Hamas is set to disarm and a transitional international body will govern the territory during the reconstruction phase, according to New York Post.The former Democratic presidential candidate, who had long advocated a two-state solution during her tenure under then President Barack Obama , urged the Trump administration to ensure that all parties honor the deal.Clinton also credited Trump’s diplomatic efforts, particularly his ability to bring Israel back to the negotiating table after the September peace talk clashes in Qatar as a key turning point.“That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, ‘No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end,’” she said.Clinton’s commendation follows her earlier comment that she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he managed to end the Russia-Ukraine war without forcing Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow.“Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, could really stand up to Putin, something we haven’t seen, but maybe this is the opportunity, if President Trump were the architect of that, I’d nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize,” she had said on the Raging Moderates podcast.At the time, Trump reacted warmly to her statement, saying, “Well, uh, that was very nice… I may have to start liking her again.”Clinton is not alone among Democrats recognizing Trump’s recent diplomatic success. Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser under former President Joe Biden , admitted the deal “finally brings an end to what felt like an unending conflict.”Even former President Barack Obama congratulated the parties involved, though notably without naming Trump in his post on X.Meanwhile, Trump on Sunday departed for a visit to Israel and Egypt, calling it a “very special” trip marking “a historic moment for peace.”He is expected to attend a joint ceremony celebrating the ceasefire and hostage release and to co-chair the Gaza Peace Summit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has praised President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a historic Gaza peace deal.

On Monday, Israel and Hamas are set to carry out a hostage-prisoner exchange as part of the first phase of a peace plan proposed by Trump.The US leader’s 20-point plan aims to end more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas, triggered by the Palestinian militant group’s unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.Herzog highlighted Trump’s broader contributions to regional peace and Israel’s security.In a statement issued, he said: “President Trump’s legacy will be remembered for generations by the State of Israel and the Jewish people. From his unwavering support for the State of Israel, to the advent of the Abraham Accords which expanded the circle of peace in our region, from the two historic agreements that brought our dear hostages home and saved countless lives, to the decisive strike on Iran’s nuclear program, President Trump’s voice has always been one of courage and leadership, and of steadfast commitment to the pursuit of peace and humanity,” according to Jerusalem Post.The Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor is awarded to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the State of Israel or to humanity.

Trump undecided on providing Tomahawks to Ukraine



Russian concern over Tomahawks



Russia 'continues aerial terror,' says Zelenskyy







As Ukraine faces continued air attacks against its energy infrastructure from Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday renewed efforts to increase his country's air defenses in talks with US President Donald Trump Zelenskyy wrote on X that the two leaders also discussed ""details related to the energy sector.""Their call followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the two leaders agreed on Sunday's topics.The phone calls followed Zelenskyy's statement on Friday that he was in discussions with US officials regarding the possible provision of various long-range precision strike weapons, including Tomahawks and additional ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles.Trump said earlier this week that he has ""sort of made a decision"" on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine.But the US president also said that before agreeing to provide Tomahawks, he wanted to know how Kyiv would use the weapons because he did not want to escalate the war.A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the United States in the coming days.Moscow also expressed ""extreme concern"" over Washington potentially providing Tomahawks to aid Ukraine as it continues to try to fend off Moscow's full-scale invasion.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ""the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.""""Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,"" he told Russian state television.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin , also said in comments released Sunday that he doubts that Washington will provide Ukraine with the cruise missiles.""I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald... sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn't take this literally, as if it's going to fly tomorrow,"" Lukashenko posted on his Telegram.Meanwhile, Russia attacked Ukraine's power grid overnight into Sunday, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter.Kyiv regional governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, were injured in the attack on a substation. Ukraine's energy ministry said key infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv.""Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,"" Zelenskyy posted on X, noting that Russia had launched ""more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs"" over the past week.Zelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil, ""Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil, those who finance this war, must all remain on the table.""","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed efforts to increase his country's air defenses in talks with US President Donald Trump.

'I'm not heaven bound': Donald Trump doubts his spiritual afterlife amid Ukraine war; refutes earlier claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-not-heaven-bound-donald-trump-doubts-his-spiritual-afterlife-amid-ukraine-war-refutes-earlier-claims/articleshow/124515482.cms,"President Donald Trump (ANI image)





US President Donald Trump on Sunday made a candid remark about his spiritual prospects while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he departed for Egypt to attend a peace summit. “I don’t think I’m going to heaven,” Trump said.The reporter had asked the US President about his earlier comments linking efforts to end the war in Ukraine to his hope of reaching heaven, saying, “You talked about how you hoped to end the war in Ukraine because it might help you get into heaven.”To this, Trump replied, “I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven. I think I’m not maybe heaven bound. I may be in heaven right now as we fly in Air Force One, I’m not sure. I’m going to be able to make heaven. But I’ve made life a lot better for a lot of people.”Earlier, Trump had openly reflected on his desire to reach heaven, linking it to his efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with Fox & Friends, he said, “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole. But if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons.”Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed, “I think the president was serious. I think the president wants to get to heaven—as I hope we all do in this room as well.”Trump has also spoken about his parents and personal life in the context of mortality. “My father lived a long time, my mother lived a long time, and they were happy, and they were great. So maybe we’re going to live a long time. I hope so,” he said.Following his conviction on 34 felony counts, he told supporters, “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are. They're up there, looking down. They say, 'How did this happen to my son?’”At a rally in Madison Square Garden in October, he added, “I know my mother's in heaven. I'm not 100% sure about my father, but it's close.”On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, urging him to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, similar to the ceasefire Trump helped secure between Israel and Hamas.In a post on X, Zelenskyy said, “I had a call with US President Donald Trump—a very positive and productive one. I congratulated POTUS on his success and the Middle East deal he was able to secure, which is an outstanding achievement. If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well—including the Russian war.”Trump described his phone call with Zelenskyy as “very productive,” highlighting that they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s air defense, resilience and long-range capabilities, along with energy sector concerns. He emphasized the importance of peace, saying, “I really think Putin would look great if he got this settled. It’s not going to be good for him if not.”On Sunday, Trump also warned Russia that he could send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Moscow does not settle the ongoing conflict.“I might say, ‘Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” he said. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.”He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so.”","US President Donald Trump on Sunday made a candid remark about his spiritual prospects while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. “I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven.

PORTLAND: Protesters rallying against the Trump administration in Portland put the city's quirky and irreverent reputation on display Sunday by pedaling through the streets wearing absolutely nothing, or close to it, in an ""emergency"" edition of the annual World Naked Bike Ride.Crowds that have gathered daily and nightly outside the immigration facility in Oregon's largest city in recent days have embraced the absurd, donning inflatable frog, unicorn, axolotl and banana costumes as they face off with federal law enforcement who often deploy tear gas and pepper balls.The bike ride is an annual tradition that usually happens in the summer, but organizers of this weekend's hastily called event said another nude ride was necessary to speak out against President Donald Trump 's attempts to mobilize the National Guard to quell protests.Rider Janene King called the nude ride a ""quintessentially Portland way to protest.""The 51-year-old was naked except for wool socks, a wig and a hat. She sipped hot tea and said she was unbothered by the steady rain and temperatures in the mid-50s (about 12 Celsius).""We definitely do not want troops coming into our city,"" King said.Bike riders made their way through the streets and to the city's US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building.Authorities there ordered people to stay out of the street and protest only on sidewalks or risk being arrested.The city is awaiting the ruling of an appeals court panel on whether Trump can send out the federalized troops after a federal judge on October 5 ordered a temporary hold on deployment.""Joy is a form of protest. Being together with mutual respect and kindness is a form of protest,"" the ride's organizers said on Instagram . ""It's your choice how much or little you wear.""Fewer people were fully naked than usual, likely because of the cool, wet weather, but some still bared it all and rode wearing only bike helmets.Naked bike rides have thronged the streets of Oregon's largest city every year since 2004, often holding up traffic as the crowd cycles through with speakers playing music.

The Pentagon is looking to buy as much as $1 billion of critical minerals to stockpile, Financial Times reported, citing public filings published in recent months by Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency (DLA).The increased purchases come as new export controls of rare earths and other key materials for defence and technology manufacturing were unveiled by China's ministry of commerce last week. China accounts for almost 70% of the world's production of rare earths, according to the US Geological Survey.Planned purchases include $500 million of cobalt, up to $245 million of antimony and $100 million of tantalum, the paper said. The DLA stockpiles alloys, rare earths, ores and precious metals, and stores them in depots across the country.

New Jersey declared a state of emergency Sunday as heavy rain accompanied by winds up to 60mph is expected to crash through the region as part of the approaching Nor'easter. The winds will persist into Monday afternoon. “The greatest effects are going to be the coastal flooding potential, especially for areas from northeastern North Carolina northward to much of the New Jersey coast,” said meteorologist Bob Oravec with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.The National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.Newark International Airport has delays of around 80 minutes for many flights, with planes headed to the airport from across North America even being ordered by the FAA to hold at their departures, NJ.com reported.

US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday hailed President Donald Trump ’s role in brokering the Gaza peace deal, saying it had united Israel, Gulf Arab nations, and communities across faiths. Vance said the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas was imminent and credited the US administration for making it possible.“It really should be any moment now,” Vance told NBC’s Meet the Press when asked about the timing for the release. On ABC’s This Week, he added, “We expect to see them alive here in the next 24 hours, probably early tomorrow morning, US time, which will be later in the day, of course, in Israel.”In a post on X, Vance said, “It’s an amazing thing… We should be proud of this team, we should be proud of our country, because these hostages are going to live their lives thanks to what the United States of America did.”He added, “Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it’s a really good thing for the world… and it happened because of President Trump’s leadership. If we can build a sustainable peace, I’m 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.”Calling it a “great morning,” the vice president said the hostages should be at home “in the next 24 hours.”Vance’s press secretary, Taylor Van Kirk, quoted him as saying, “The lesson here is that Donald Trump refused to go down the failed, traditional diplomatic pathway.He cut his own Trump diplomatic pathway, and because of that, it was successful.”Vance also clarified that the US does not plan to deploy troops in Gaza. “We already have troops at central command… They are going to monitor the terms of the ceasefire... The idea that we're going to have troops on the ground in Gaza, in Israel, that is NOT our intention - that is not our plan. There was a bit of misreporting there,” he said.Describing the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, Vance reposted, “This is a remarkable achievement from an administration that really chose a nonconventional path to diplomacy... these 20 hostages are going to come home to their families... It’s a great thing, and I’m very excited about it. It shows what happens when you go outside the traditional, failed diplomatic roots and actually try something new.”Vance further praised Trump for uniting Israel and Gulf Arab states for a shared objective. “Trump has done something that no other world leader has been able to do: unite the Israelis with the Gulf Arab states for a common objective... to bring the hostages home, to stop the war, and to build the kind of long-term settlement that... can bring a lasting peace,” he said.Meanwhile, Al Jazeera reported that bulldozers have begun clearing rubble in Gaza City after two years of war, as tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their devastated homes in northern Gaza. Preparations are underway for a Gaza ceasefire summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, where Trump is expected to attend.According to Al Jazeera, the conflict has killed at least 67,806 people and wounded 170,066 since October 2023. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.",US Vice President JD Vance hailed President Donald Trump's role in brokering the Gaza peace deal. Vance said the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas was imminent and credited the US administration for making it possible. Vance also clarified that the US does not plan to deploy troops in Gaza.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124511718,imgsize-1147733,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-and-jd-vance-ap.jpg"
"US CDC layoff: Hundreds reinstated as ‘incorrect notification’ fired them, after Donald Trump’s vow to ‘fire Democrats-aligned workers’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-cdc-layoff-hundreds-reinstated-as-incorrect-notification-fired-them-after-donadl-trumps-vow-to-fire-democrats-aligned-workers/articleshow/124505419.cms,"CDC (left), Donald Trump (agencies)





Hundreds of employees at the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) who were laid off on Friday night have been reinstated, after officials said the terminations were triggered by an “incorrect notification,” reported CNN.According to the American federation of government employees (AFGE), around 1,300 CDC staff received layoff notices late Friday, but roughly 700 were reinstated on Saturday after the agency discovered an error, while about 600 remain laid off.“The employees who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force,” said Andrew Nixon, communications director for the US department of health and human services (HHS), as quoted by the news outlet.Among those reinstated were staff linked to the CDC’s morbidity and mortality weekly report, according to Dr Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency’s chief medical officer and deputy director. Houry and several senior officials had stepped down earlier in protest after the firing of recently confirmed CDC director Dr Susan Monarez.Athalia Christie, the CDC’s incident commander for the measles response, was also among those mistakenly terminated.The US has reported 1,563 measles cases since January, the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago.Employees reinstated include personnel from the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, the global health center, and the public health infrastructure center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants for state and local health programs, said Dr Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit focused on public health workers.Officers from the CDC’s epidemic intelligence service (EIS) - known as “disease detectives” - were also mistakenly let go. A CDC official told reporters that “we think all staff and all officers are back,” noting the issue stemmed from a coding error in the layoff notices.However, workers from the CDC’s Washington office, violence prevention programmes, and the Office of the director of the injury center remain separated from the agency under the latest phase of the Trump administration’s reduction in force (RIF) initiative.Speaking late Friday, US President Donald Trump said he planned to fire “a lot” of federal workers, vowing to target those he claimed were aligned with the Democratic party.“We figure they started this thing, so they should be Democrat-oriented,” Trump said, blaming Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.”The legality of firing federal employees during a shutdown has been challenged in court. After the office of management and budget director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X, AFGE replied, “The lawsuit has been filed.”A court filing said more than 4,100 federal workers were affected across HHS, commerce, education, energy, housing and urban development, homeland security, and treasury departments.","1,300 CDC staff received layoff notices late Friday, but roughly 700 were reinstated on Saturday after the agency discovered an error.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists. The Imam of the mosque was killed in the attack.Around 200 trainees, instructors, and staff members were present at the training school during the attack, police said.Thirteen people, including police personnel, were also injured in the attack, they said.According to officials, all trainee recruits and staff members were safely evacuated to secure locations.Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement said the office of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists.Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, confirmed that the area has been completely cleared.Pakistan continues to reel under terrorism with overall violence surging by 46 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, a media report said last week.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and over 67 per cent (221) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, with over 25 per cent of fatalities (230) and incidents (85).Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies' personnel, and security forces.",Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in

Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers. ""Now I'll have to figure out again how to reach my office,"" he said.","Clashes erupt in Lahore as police try to stop pro-Palestine march to Islamabad.

Why the defeat hurts Pakistan



How Trump’s self-promotion cost him







Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

Activists Slam Yunus Govt AT UNHRC, Say Bangladesh Turning Into Proxy War Zone Targeting India





DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has said India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"", while claiming that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal"" in nature and require ""consultations"" between both nations.The Nobel laureate also stressed that the interim govt - formed after Hasina's ouster last year following massive protests - is ""very alert"" about communal harmony, as he dismissed as ""fake news"" reports of attacks against the minority Hindu community in his country. Yunus said that his message to them, when he meets the community's leaders, ""is don't go back and say, 'I'm a Hindu, so protect me'... always say, 'I'm a citizen of this country. I'm entitled to all the protection the state is supposed to give me"".Talking on the issues related to Hasina and his conversations with PM Narendra Modi in an interview with Mehdi Hassan of online media outlet Zeteo, Yunus said, ""Two things: first, I said you want to keep her, I can't tell you what to do with her but make sure she doesn't talk about us. She doesn't talk about the Bangladeshi people.""Dhaka had sought Hasina's extradition in Dec last year and there has been no development yet.""Probably they (India) will keep her. If some legal obligation is there that they cannot avoid, then the situation will be different,"" he said. They have been supporting her all along, Yunus said. The chief adviser added that those who are behind her hope that she will come back in Bangladesh, ""with full glory of returning as a victorious leader"", claiming that ""some external forces are supporting her to come back"".When Mehdi noted that ""last Nov, around 30,000 Hindus in Bangladesh gathered to protest against your govt, claiming there have been thousands of attacks on their community. (US President) Donald Trump called the violence in Bangladesh 'barbaric',"" Yunus said, ""One of the specialities about India right now is fake news, a barrage of fake news."" ""This is fake news. You can't go by this fake news,"" he said.Asked if he was saying the reports were exaggerated, or if there's no anti-Hindu violence, Yunus said there is ""some conflict sometimes, some family problem, land problem and something"". ""You happen to be my neighbour. You are a Hindu neighbour. I am a Muslim neighbour. We have a problem with our land demarcation, just like two neighbours. So you said this is Hindu-Muslim.

The TTP’s deadly resurgence



What next for Pakistan and the Taliban?



(With inputs from agencies)





Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting that exposed the fragility of their long and volatile frontier. Afghan officials said their forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight “retaliatory operations,” while Islamabad gave a far lower death toll of 23, describing the attacks as “unprovoked” adding that it killed 200 Taliban fighters.The exchanges, centred along the 2,600-kilometre Durand Line (which Afghanistan has never recognised), follow accusations by Kabul that Pakistan bombed Afghan territory including: Strikes on Kabul and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said, “Our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response. ”The border tension has disrupted the Torkham crossing, a vital trade route, and triggered alarm in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have urged restraint, calling for dialogue to “maintain the security and stability of the region.”Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, currently in India, denied Islamabad’s accusations that the Taliban harbour members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), a banned militant group behind recent deadly attacks inside Pakistan.“There is no presence of TTP in Afghanistan now,” he told reporters. “They are Pakistani people from displaced areas and are allowed to live in the country as refugees. The border is more than 2,400 km long—it could neither be controlled by ‘Changez’ nor ‘Angrez’. Strength alone cannot control it. This fight is inside Pakistan.”Muttaqi accused Islamabad of failing to “take its people into confidence” and of “endangering its own people to please a few.” But he warned that Kabul would act if provoked further: “We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don’t succeed, we have other options.”For decades, Pakistan was considered a patron of the Taliban, providing shelter and support since the group’s emergence in the 1990s.Pakistan has supported the Taliban since their inception, initially backing the anti-Soviet mujahideen who later formed the group. In the 1990s, Islamabad was one of only three nations to recognise the Taliban regime and was the last to cut ties in 2001. After the US invasion, Pakistan helped the Taliban regroup, offering safe havens and medical aid, which allowed the movement to endure despite heavy battlefield losses.Islamabad hoped that the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 would secure its western flank and curb cross-border militancy. Instead, it has seen a resurgence of attacks.However, with the war over, the Taliban no longer relies on Pakistan for sanctuaries or wartime support. Now, it focuses on gaining legitimacy at home, where distrust of Pakistan runs deep. “By lashing out at Pakistan, the Taliban hopes to buy some goodwill from the Afghan public,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told Time.comAnalysts say Pakistan’s influence over the Taliban has eroded sharply. “Taliban leaders no longer need refuge across the border or Pakistani assistance,” wrote Foreign Policy, noting that the leverage Islamabad once enjoyed “is at risk of being lost.” The Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP reflects not just ideological affinity but also domestic priorities: distancing themselves from Pakistani control helps their pursuit of legitimacy at home.“Pakistan finds itself in a predicament largely of its own making—the Taliban leadership that it supported throughout much of the 20-year insurgency in Afghanistan is now sheltering militant groups targeting Islamabad,” Joshua White, a professor in international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, told Time.com in July last year.The TTP, listed by the United Nations as an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist organisation since 2011, aims to overthrow Pakistan’s government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, the group has waged a bloody campaign for nearly two decades, killing hundreds of soldiers, police, and civilians.Pakistan’s military campaigns including: Operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad. once splintered the group, pushing its leaders into Afghanistan. But the Taliban’s victory in Kabul re-energised the TTP, which has since reunited its factions and ramped up attacks. According to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), violence in Pakistan in 2024 returned to levels last seen in 2015.A UN report in July 2025 claimed the TTP enjoys “logistical and operational support” from Taliban authorities, a claim Kabul denies. Islamabad, under pressure from growing domestic insecurity, has launched cross-border airstrikes on suspected TTP hideouts and expelled over a million Afghan refugees since last year.“The inability of the Taliban administration to take concrete action against the TTP has significantly strained relations,” Islamabad-based analyst Tahir Khan told Deutsche Welle. “Unless the issue of the TTP is effectively addressed, meaningful improvement in bilateral ties will remain elusive.”The violence along the Durand Line has once again shown how Pakistan’s decades-long strategy of nurturing militant proxies for influence in Afghanistan has backfired. The very groups it once supported are now undermining its internal security.Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused Afghan forces of firing on civilians, warning that “no provocation will be tolerated.” Islamabad’s retaliatory strikes have reportedly destroyed multiple Afghan border posts and militant camps, though the Taliban claim to have seized several Pakistani outposts in return.Both sides remain locked in a dangerous cycle of provocation and denial. Kabul insists the TTP problem is “a fight inside Pakistan,” while Islamabad continues to demand action. Yet neither seems willing to take the political or military risks required for a lasting peace.Until that reckoning comes, the Durand Line will remain what it has always been: not a border of control, but a fault line of crisis.","Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting. Afghan officials said their forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight “retaliatory operations,” while Islamabad gave a far lower death toll of 23. The exchanges, centred along the 2,600-kilometre Durand Line, follow accusations by Kabul that Pakistan bombed Afghan territory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124503197,imgsize-1811650,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-fighters-in-kabul-2021-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-file-photo-ap.jpg"

A 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday evening, according to the national centre for seismology (NCS).

Afghan Taliban Strikes Pakistan; Heavy Fighting On 7 Border Points Along Durand Line





Afghanistan’s eastern frontier flared up this weekend — a border that has rarely known peace since colonial lines sliced through Pashtun lands. The Taliban , now the state it once fought from the shadows, said its forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani troops after Islamabad’s alleged air strikes on Afghan soil. From Kunar to Helmand, provinces that have lived on the edge of someone’s war for decades, local officials confirmed that clashes were ongoing.On Saturday, Afghanistan’s Taliban forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border, accusing Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on its soil, senior officials from several provinces said.“In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces,” Taliban border forces in the east “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas,” the Afghan military said in a statement, quoted by AFP.On Thursday, two explosions were heard in the Afghan capital and another in the southeast of the country. The following day, the Taliban-run defence ministry blamed the attacks on Pakistan , accusing its neighbor of ""violating its sovereignty.""Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP that the operations had concluded ""successfully"" at midnight.He added a warning: ""If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territory, our armed forces are prepared to defend it and will respond decisively.""Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil."" The TTP, trained in combat in Afghanistan and claiming to share the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban, is accused by Islamabad of having killed hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.""This evening, Taliban forces began using weapons. We fired first light and then heavy artillery at four points along the border,"" a senior official in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, told AFP.""Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire and shot down three Afghan quadcopters suspected of carrying explosives. Intense fighting continues, but so far, no casualties have been reported,"" he continued.In recent months, TTP militants have intensified their campaign of violence against Pakistani security forces in the mountainous areas along the border.Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to expel militants who use Afghan territory to launch attacks on Pakistan, an accusation denied by authorities in Kabul.","Afghan Taliban forces launch armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border.

Activists Slam Yunus Govt AT UNHRC, Say Bangladesh Turning Into Proxy War Zone Targeting India





The Bangladesh Army on Saturday announced that it has taken into custody 15 serving officers over the alleged cases of enforced disappearances during the tenure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , who stepped down following student-led protests in August 2024.The army’s action comes three days after Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) issued warrants for 25 military officers, AFP reported. The tribunal is prosecuting former senior figures linked to Hasina’s government and her now-banned Awami League party.“The 15 serving officers have been taken into custody. They are detached from their families and are being held in high-security detention with guards and other necessary arrangements,” Major General Md Hakimuzzaman, the army’s adjutant general, told reporters at the military headquarters in Dhaka.The remaining 10 include nine retired officers and one who is on leave pending retirement, the senior army official added.Hakimuzzaman acknowledged that the arrests would impact troop morale ahead of the general elections, likely to be held in February 2026.“I can’t deny that the arrest warrants against military officers are affecting us, but we will remain steadfast in ensuring justice,” he remarked.The country’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and which took charge days after Hasina’s ouster, formed the commission to investigate the disappearance cases.It has so far received around 1,700 complaints.The accused officers are expected to appear before the ICT on October 22.This marks the first time such a large number of senior-ranking serving and retired security officials are likely to face civilian trials in Bangladesh.India’s eastern neighbour witnessed large-scale student-led protests that began in July last year against government job quotas. However, the movement took a dramatic turn after a bloody government crackdown, eventually leading to Sheikh Hasina’s resignation on August 5 — she left for India shortly after resigning.",Bangladesh Army has taken into custody 15 serving officers over alleged cases of enforced disappearances.

Why it matters



The big picture



No private escape hatch: Having ditched private insurance decades ago over payment disputes, Clarkson maintains a self-funded medical pot — but in an emergency, the nearest private facility was two hours away.

Having ditched private insurance decades ago over payment disputes, Clarkson maintains a self-funded medical pot — but in an emergency, the nearest private facility was two hours away.

Expecting resentment from staff, Clarkson instead found kindness, efficiency and unexpectedly good hospital food. The treatment, though painful, worked — and he left deeply appreciative. Criticism softened, not scrapped: Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about” during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics.

Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about” during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics. A national paradox laid bare: Britons may grumble about long waits and systemic flaws, yet trust in the NHS remains strong — a sentiment Clarkson now shares firsthand.

Bottom line:





For a man who’s made a career out of roaring engines and roaring opinions, Jeremy Clarkson has always reserved a special kind of scorn for the NHS. He’s called it bloated, broken and outdated — a “creaking monster” swallowing Britain’s money and happiness whole. But fate, with its impeccable comedic timing, decided to put his rhetoric to the test. Just nine hours after his latest tirade against the health service hit breakfast tables, Clarkson was racing to an NHS hospital himself, clutching more than just his pride. And there, lying in a gown that left his backside exposed to the world, Britain’s most bombastic motoring mouthpiece was forced to admit a humbling truth: for all its flaws, the NHS still works when you need it most.In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson once again attacked the NHS as an outdated, cash-devouring institution in need of a total rethink. But later that same day, a sudden medical emergency meant the broadcaster had no choice but to rely on the very system he had just ridiculed. With private treatment hours away, he checked into an NHS hospital in Oxford, bracing himself for hostile nurses and bitter tea. What he got instead was professional care, spotless facilities, and a recovery that left him quietly — if reluctantly — grateful.Clarkson’s abrupt change of circumstances mirrors the conflicted relationship many Britons have with the NHS: it’s easy to criticise when you’re healthy, but when illness strikes, there’s no substitute for it. His experience serves as a reminder of the health service’s enduring value — not as a perfect system, but as a vital public institution that delivers when it counts.A swift dose of irony: Hours after deriding the NHS as a “bottomless abyss”, Clarkson became a patient, forced to trust the system he had just dismissed.Jeremy Clarkson hasn’t turned into an NHS evangelist, but his hospital dash has quieted his trademark complaints. It’s hard to sneer at a “creaking monster” when it’s the very thing that put you back on your feet.","Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about’ during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics.

"'Smashed windows, graffiti and intimidation': Feminist conference venue in Brighton vandalised by trans activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/smashed-windows-graffiti-and-intimidation-feminist-conference-venue-in-brighton-vandalised-by-trans-activists-watch/articleshow/124470679.cms,"



A feminist conference in Brighton was left without legal protection on Thursday after trans activists vandalised its venue, sparking concern among organisers.Filia, which is hosting the three-day event aimed at defending women’s rights and challenging sex-based injustices, had applied to Brighton and Hove city council for a public spaces protection order to prevent disruptions.The incident occurred near the Brighton Centre, when masked activists from a group calling themselves “Bash Back” smashed the glass frontage of the venue. They later posted a video online, saying the conference would be attended by “hate groups” including the LGB Alliance and Transgender Trend.The activists also mentioned the conference alumni, including JK Rowling, and the director of Scottish Lesbians, one of the groups involved in the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman.Filia submitted the security request on Monday, citing fears of disruption. The application said the order would prevent noise such as shouting, chanting, banging objects, or playing loud music in a marked area around the venue. “Many attendees and speakers have experienced sexual and/or domestic violence perpetrated by men, and a number have experienced such violence in warzones,” the application added.On Friday morning, the council refused the order, stating in a letter shared with The Times: “Having reviewed the proposal for a protection order the council did not consider it met the relevant legal test and was [a] disproportionate approach which would be highly unlikely to be granted.”The council said the police would continue to monitor the situation to keep protests peaceful.Lisa-Marie Taylor, Filia’s chief executive, criticised the decision: “We have heard today that Brighton and Hove council has rejected Filia’s public spaces protection order which we submitted in advance to pre-empt behaviour and aggression of this sort. We call on the council to condemn last night’s antics and to acknowledge that to protest against Filia is to protest against women gathering to discuss their lives. It is shocking and saddening that a conference for women to discuss domestic abuse, sexual violence and lesbian safety, has been met with smashed windows, graffiti and intimidation.”The conference will run until Sunday and includes sessions on sexual violence, domestic abuse, and ending violence against women and girls. Filia said it worked with the police and security to keep the event safe, while the council said the PSPO request did not meet legal requirements or deadlines.","Filia, which is hosting the three-day event aimed at defending women’s rights, had applied to Brighton and Hove city council for a public spaces protection order to prevent disruptions. masked activists from a group calling themselves ‘Bash Back’ smashed the glass frontage of the venue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124471091,imgsize-37810,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Focus on trade and investment





NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal in a bilateral meeting, while also focusing on efforts to deepen their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in areas like technology, defence co-production and security.Modi also raised the issue of anti-India activities by Khalistan separatists. While the PM himself did not bring up the issue in his media remarks after the meeting, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said later that the PM emphasised radicalism and violent extremism had no space in democratic societies and “in particular should not be allowed to use the freedoms or abuse the freedoms provided by democratic societies”. It is understood that the issue of extradition of Indian economic figities was also discussed.He also said that the PM underlined the need to move against them within the legal frameworks that are available to both sides.Modi, who announced an agreement for cooperation in military training under which IAF flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force, said India and the UK are natural partners as their relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.“In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi in a joint press statement with Starmer after their meeting.Defence, in fact, was a major focus area in the meeting with the leaders endorsing an Intent to finalize an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on cooperation in developing maritime electric propulsion systems for Indian Naval platforms. Another agreement for supply of Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems to support India’s air defence capabilities was also announced. According to a joint statement, this agreement, in the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will meet the current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence, and support a long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.Both leaders agreed to work closely in promoting reformed multilateralism, including reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as Starmer reiterated UK’s long-standing support for India’s “legitimate aspirations for permanent membership in a reformed UNSC”.Modi and Starmer focused on ramping up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific too as they committed to, according to the joint statement, robust maritime security collaboration in the region, including establishment of the Regional Maritime Security Centre of Excellence (RMSCE) under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).Recalling the “historic” Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) that India concluded with the UK in July, Modi said this agreement will reduce import costs between the 2 countries, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both Indian and UK industries and consumers.He said there are immense possibilities in the technology partnership, including in critical and emerging technologies, between India and the UK. “We are working to connect the UK’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale. Last year, we launched the India–UK Technology Security Initiative. To connect the youth of both countries through an innovation bridge, we have taken several steps, including establishing the Connectivity and Innovation Centre and the Joint AI Research Centre,” he said.The leaders also announced the setting up of a UK – India Critical Minerals Processing and Downstream Collaboration Guild to build concrete partnerships which “strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains and deliver investment and growth in both nations”.“Our defense cooperation has also deepened. We are moving towards defense co-production and connecting the defense industries of both countries. Taking our defense collaboration a step further, we have signed an agreement for cooperation in military training, under which Flying Instructors from the Indian Air Force will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force,” he said.Both leaders looked forward to an early ratification of the India–UK CETAThey welcomed the resetting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) which will support the governance and utilisation of the CETAFocus on construction, infrastructure and clean energy, advanced manufacturing, defence, education, sport, culture, financial and professional business services to realise the benefits of FTABoth Prime Ministers reiterated their commitment to improving connectivity and enhancing cooperation in the aviation sector.","PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal.

LONDON: An Indian-origin surgeon who worked in the NHS for 25 years has been struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media, including calling a Jewish man “circumcised vermin” and a “Jewish rodent”.Manoj Sen, who qualified as a doctor in 1983 with an MBBS from the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, (Calcutta Medical College), and moved to the UK in 1985, wrote on Facebook in response to Mr A, on October 10 2023, three days after the Nova festival massacre: “When dealing with circumcised vermin like you, not even the strongest measures will help,” adding that he was “regretful enough rats were not liquidated at Auschwitz”.In the same rant, Sen called Mr A a “Jewish c**t” and “Jewboy” and also wrote “Die Juden sind unsere Ungluck (The Jews are our misfortune)”. “Good thing he is no longer in a respectful place like India. He belongs in the flames of a crematorium,” he said of Mr A. At the time Sen was working as a surgeon at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow.Mr A raised a complaint about Sen with the General Medical Council (GMC) and the police.Sen was arrested and issued a police caution.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service concluded that Sen’s conduct amounted to serious misconduct and that immediate suspension and erasure from the medical register were the only appropriate sanction.The tribunal found his comments were antisemitic and seriously offensive, especially his reference to Auschwitz and a crematorium, which, the tribunal said, “went far beyond any acceptable or lawful expression of opinion”.“The language used suggested a deep hostility towards Jews as a group, rather than merely a personal attack on the complainant,” the tribunal said.The tribunal noted there was no written apology and “the degree of hostility expressed in his comments is fundamentally incompatible with the duty of a doctor to treat patients equally”, and that he had brought the medical profession into disrepute.On August 13 Sen told the GMC he did not wish to participate in the hearing and said “to go ahead and good luck.”In an email from Sen to the GMC in Feb 2024, he wrote: “In the heat of the moment I made wrongful and injudicious remarks — for which I have apologised in public on Facebook as well as privately to the police. Those remarks are entirely out of character.”",Indian-origin surgeon struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media.

Two Indian-origin brothers from east London have been sentenced after a mobile phone sent for repair uncovered disturbing videos of child sex abuse, leading to their conviction for multiple offences, reported BBC.Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday, following his guilty plea to 17 charges including rape and assault of a child under 13, possession of indecent images, and voyeurism. His crimes also extended to sexual offences against a woman over 16.His brother, Kishnan Patel, also from Plaistow, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in June after pleading guilty to four counts related to making and possessing indecent images of children.The metropolitan police revealed that the investigation began when videos of child abuse were found on a mobile device belonging to Kishnan Patel, which had been submitted for repairs. Subsequent detective work identified Vruj Patel as the perpetrator in the footage, confirmed by visible features such as clothing and jewellery.Detective sergeant Rob Blant described Vruj Patel as a “cowardly, opportunistic offender who has preyed on vulnerable victims for his own sexual gratification,” as quoted by BBC.He added, “There are teams of dedicated, professional officers working across London who will leave no stone unturned to identify those who seek to commit offences against vulnerable people and bring offenders to justice.”Authorities believe some offences occurred as early as 2018, with voyeurism offences potentially continuing until recently. Police are appealing for any additional victims to come forward, expressing concern that there may be more children affected, possibly in the brothers’ home.Vruj Patel has been placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely, while Kishnan Patel will be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.Throughout the investigation and trial, the victim-survivors received specialist support from law enforcement agencies, the met police confirmed.","Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

What is Hong Kong's national security law?

Four former opposition lawmakers, jailed in Hong Kong's landmark national security case last year, were released on Tuesday after completing their time in prison.They were the first among 45 convicted that were released from jail.All four individuals were transported from prison in vehicles with their curtains drawn.The four opposition figures pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to four years and two months in prison in November.Last year, authorities in Hong Kong arrested 47 individuals on charges of subversion under a national security law imposed by Beijing.The figures included some notable democracy advocates, elected lawmakers, district councilors, unionists and academics.During the trial two were found not guilty. The 45 others received sentences between four to 10 years.The four opposition members released on Tuesday were in custody since March 2021 and received the lightest penalty among the convicted.The arrests came after Beijing passed a national security law in 2020 in response to large pro-democracy protests in the financial hub.Under that law, Hong Kong democrats were accused of conspiring to subvert state power through a multi-step plan. The group organized a primary election in 2020 to secure a legislative majority and rejected the government budget.The sentences have been condemned by Western governments and rights groups. The United States labelled the penalties as ""unjust"" and the United Nations Human Rights Office also expressed grave concern.Hong Kong and Beijing assert that everyone is equal under the national security laws and that the democrats received a fair trial.Hong Kong has arrested 322 people for national security crimes and convicted 163 of them in April under the national security law.","Four former opposition lawmakers, jailed in Hong Kong's landmark national security case last year, were released on Tuesday.

'Serious disruption'

France affected

MADRID: Lights flickered back to life in Spain and Portugal early Tuesday after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula stranding passengers in trains and hundreds of elevators while millions saw phone and internet coverage die.More than 80 per cent of Spain's national electricity supply had been restored by early Tuesday, the REE power operator said. Lights came on again in Madrid and in Portugal's capital.Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged, though wild rumours spread on messaging networks about cyber attacks.Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the source of the outage was ""probably in Spain"". Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said ""all the potential causes"" were being analysed and warned the public ""not to speculate"" because of the risk of ""misinformation"".Sanchez said about 15 gigawatts of electricity, more than half of the power being consumed at the time, ""suddenly disappeared"" in about five seconds.Sanchez was unable to say when power would be completely restored in Spain and warned that some workers would have to stay home Tuesday. Montenegro said Portugal's power would be back ""within hours"".Power was restored overnight to around 6.2 million households in Portugal out of 6.5 million, according to the national electricity grid operator.The outage rippled briefly into southwest France while Morocco saw disruption to some internet providers and airport check-in systems.People were ""stunned"", according to Carlos Candori, a 19-year-old construction worker who had to exit the paralysed Madrid metro system. ""This has never happened in Spain"".""There's no (phone) coverage, I can't call my family, my parents, nothing: I can't even go to work,"" he told AFP.In Madrid and cities across Spain and Portugal, panicked customers rushed to withdraw cash from banks, and streets filled with crowds floundering for a phone signal. Long lines formed for taxis and buses.With stop lights knocked out, police struggled to keep densely congested traffic moving and authorities urged motorists to stay home.In Madrid alone 286 rescue operations were carried out to free people trapped in lifts, regional authorities said.Trains were halted across the country and late Monday, the transport minister said there were still 11 trains with stranded passengers who needed help.Railway stations in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, Seville and four other major cities were to be kept open all night so that stranded passengers could sleep there.Spain's nuclear power plants automatically went offline as a safety precaution, with diesel generators maintaining them in a ""safe condition"", the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) said.Sanchez said the blackout, which hit just after midday, caused ""serious disruption"" for millions and ""economic losses in businesses, in companies, in industries"".The European Commission said it was in contact with Spain and Portugal over the crisis. European Council President Antonio Costa said on X: ""There are no indications of any cyberattack"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered support in a call to Sanchez, noting his country had become specialised in such emergencies after three years of Russia attacking its electrical grid.""No matter what happens, we are always ready to assist and support our friends,"" he said on X.The huge power cut disrupted flights to and from Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon, European air traffic organisation Eurocontrol said.Transport chaos also gripped Spain's second city, Barcelona, where locals and tourists alike flooded the streets in an attempt to find out what had happened.Student Laia Montserrat left school when the lights went out.""As the internet wasn't coming back, they told us to go home... (but) there weren't trains either,"" she told AFP. ""Now we don't know what to do.""The internet activity monitoring site Netblocks told AFP the blackout caused a ""loss of much of the country's digital infrastructure"". It said web connections plunged to just 17 percent of normal usage.Spain's El Pais newspaper reported that hospitals used back-up generators to keep critical wards going, but some units were left without power.Massive blackouts have affected other countries around the world in recent years.Huge outages struck Tunisia in September 2023, Sri Lanka in August 2020, and Argentina and Uruguay in June 2019. In July 2012, India experienced a vast blackout.In Europe, in November 2006, 10 million people were left without power for an hour in France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. That was caused by a failure in Germany's grid.","Lights flickered back to life in Spain and Portugal early Tuesday after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula.

'50% of power restored to Spain'

A massive power failure affected Spain and Portugal on Monday, causing widespread disruption. The unprecedented outage left thousands stranded on trains while millions lost access to phone and internet services, causing chaos on roads and at airports.Both countries declared a state of emergency as they struggled to manage the disruption.According to Portugal's Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), the electrical supply was disrupted across the Iberian Peninsula and parts of France after midday.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that authorities continued investigating the incident hours afterwards.The blackout occurred when there was a sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of power. ""This is something that has never happened before,"" Sanchez stated.""To give you an idea, 15 gigawatts is equivalent to approximately 60 per cent of the country's demand at that time,"" Sanchez added.Sanchez confirmed that at 12.33 pm on Monday, Spain's power grid experienced this unprecedented loss within five seconds.Red Electrica's operations chief Eduardo Prieto described the situation as ""exceptional and extraordinary"".The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center confirmed no evidence of a cyberattack. Teresa Ribera, European Commission executive vice president, called it ""one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times"".The disruption began at midday, affecting traffic in Madrid and Lisbon. Spanish emergency services evacuated approximately 35,000 people from over 100 trains. By 11 pm, passengers from 11 trains still awaited evacuation.Essential services were severely affected. Hospitals relied on generators, whilst petrol stations ceased operations.Mobile networks largely failed, though some applications worked intermittently. The outage impacted about 60 million people across the peninsula, excluding Spain's islands and African territories.Following a National Security Council meeting, Sanchez announced army deployment to distribute generators to affected areas on Tuesday.Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, after emergency cabinet discussions, anticipated power restoration by day's end. Portuguese officials suggested the problem originated outside their country, according to national news agency Lusa.""We have learnt of a general blackout in the electricity grid, which originated outside our territory, most probably in Spain,"" Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said in a televised address.Spain's electrical network data showed a significant decline in demand from 27,500 megawatts to approximately 15,000 megawatts around 12:15 pm.Spanish airports operated on emergency power systems, causing flight delays across Aena's 56 airports, including major hubs in Madrid and Barcelona.In Portugal's capital, airport terminals ceased operations, leaving tourists waiting outside. Dutch visitor Marc Brandsma told AP, ""We haven't seen any plane arriving or departing in the 50 minutes we've been waiting here.""The outage affected various institutions and events, including the Spanish Parliament and Madrid Open tennis tournament.Some citizens found alternative ways to spend time during the connectivity loss, whilst in Barcelona, crowds gathered outside non-functioning shops sharing information.The situation caused anxiety amongst those unable to contact family members. A Barcelona shop worker, Helen Osorio, stated, ""I can't even call my boss because nothing works.""Generator supplies were exhausted in Terrassa, an industrial centre 50 kilometres from Barcelona.Portuguese emergency services activated backup systems, with additional police deployed to assist with increased emergency calls, particularly regarding lift entrapments.The crisis affected various services in Portugal, including underground transport evacuations, court operations, and electronic payment systems.Spain's Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlask announced emergency measures across several regions, including Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia, La Rioja, and Madrid.Portugal's Prime Minister Luis Montenegro declared an energy emergency, stating, ""We have learnt of a general blackout in the electricity grid, which originated outside our territory, most probably in Spain.""Portuguese authorities established a crisis management centre and requested public cooperation in reducing energy consumption.The power failure left numerous passengers stranded in metropolitan transport systems in both nations' capitals.Spanish governmental officials convened an emergency meeting at Moncloa to monitor developments.Power was being restored to Spain through electricity drawn from Morocco and France, as acknowledged by Spain's Prime Minister. The nation increased its hydroelectric and combined cycle thermal power production to manage the crisis.By 11 pm, Spain had restored approximately 50% of its power supply, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez committing to full restoration by Tuesday's end.This incident marked Europe's second significant power disruption following the March 20 Heathrow Airport shutdown, occurring amidst heightened vigilance against potential Russian-backed interference.","A massive power failure affected Spain and Portugal on Monday, causing widespread disruption.

What are the key issues

How the elections work and when to expect results

Canadians head to the polls today in a crucial federal election after a dramatic few months shaped by political changes at home and tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney , who took office in March following Justin Trudeau’s resignation, called the snap election in response to growing political pressure and a worsening trade dispute with US President Donald Trump.Initially seen as vulnerable, the Liberal Party's prospects have improved as Carney presented himself as a steady leader against external economic threats. Canadians will now decide who will govern as they elect representatives to the House of Commons across 343 constituencies, where the majority is 172 seats.Prime Minister Mark Carney, 60, leads the Liberal Party into his first general election. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was chosen as Liberal leader with overwhelming support earlier this year. Despite his financial expertise and international reputation, this marks his first attempt at winning public office in Canada.The other main contender is Pierre Poilievre , 45, the leader of the Conservative Party. A long-time Member of Parliament from Calgary, Poilievre has built his campaign around promises of smaller government and lower taxes, criticising the Liberals for what he called ""woke"" policies and economic mismanagement. Once leading the polls comfortably, Poilievre has found the race tightening in recent weeks.Jagmeet Singh leads the New Democratic Party ( NDP ), a progressive force that currently holds 24 seats. Meanwhile, Yves-François Blanchet heads the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec nationalist party with strong regional support.At the time Parliament was dissolved, the Liberals held 152 seats, the Conservatives 120, the Bloc 33, and the NDP 24, with the remainder scattered among independents and smaller parties.The Liberal Party, currently in power, is now led by Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor. Carney took over from Justin Trudeau and positions the Liberals as centrist, focusing on affordability, climate action, and social supports.The Conservative Party, Canada’s main opposition, is led by Pierre Poilievre. He champions lower taxes, cutting red tape, and a tougher stance on crime and immigration, appealing to fiscally conservative voters.The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, advocates for social justice, wealth redistribution, and expanded public services like dental care and affordable housing.The Bloc Québécois, under Yves-François Blanchet, focuses solely on Quebec’s interests, promoting its autonomy within Canada.The Green Party, co-led by Elizabeth May, which pushes for environmental sustainability and climate-focused economic reforms.The shadow of US President Donald Trump looms large over today's election. Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods and his provocative suggestion that Canada should become the ""51st state"" have stirred nationalist sentiment among Canadian voters.Affordability issues are shaping the concerns of younger Canadians in this election. Among voters aged 18 to 44, 43% cited housing as the most pressing issue facing the country, underlining the impact of soaring home prices and rental costs. US-Canada relations ranked second for this group, named by 39%, followed closely by inflation at 38%.In contrast, older Canadians aged 45 and above are more concerned with traditional pillars of security. They are significantly more likely to cite healthcare, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) as top priorities. These concerns reflect growing unease over an ageing population and the future sustainability of support systems.Younger Canadians appear focused on the cost of living, employment stability, and global relations, particularly as the economic fallout from US tariffs continues to ripple across industries. Older voters, meanwhile, are looking for reassurance that public healthcare and pension benefits will be protected and strengthened.All major parties have pledged to boost defence spending to meet NATO's 2% GDP target. The Liberals will invest C$18bn in new equipment like submarines and icebreakers, while Conservatives plan C$17bn and new Arctic bases. The NDP aims for the target by 2032 and would cancel US fighter jet contracts.On housing, Liberals promise a federal developer and C$25bn in financing to double housing starts. Conservatives want to build 2.3 million homes by tying funding to city performance and selling federal land. The NDP pledges 3 million affordable units and 100,000 rent-controlled homes.On climate, Liberals back industrial carbon pricing and clean energy investment. Conservatives would scrap all carbon pricing, while the NDP supports renewables and opposes new pipelines.Canada’s federal elections operate under a system similar to that of the United Kingdom. Citizens will cast a single vote for a local representative to the House of Commons. The candidate receiving the most votes in each constituency wins; a majority is not required. The leader of the party that wins the most seats is invited to form the government and becomes Prime Minister.If no party wins an outright majority, the leading party can attempt to form a minority government or build a coalition with smaller parties.Polling stations open across six time zones and will close mostly by 9:30 pm Eastern Daylight Time. Due to the vast geography of Canada, some ridings will have polls closing slightly later to ensure fairness.Ballots are hand-counted by federal officials under the supervision of party representatives. Most in-person votes will be counted at local polling places after polls close. Special ballots, such as those cast by military members, prisoners, and Canadians living abroad, are processed separately and may take longer.Elections Canada expects to have the ""vast majority"" of results available on election night. However, only preliminary figures will be released initially. Final official results, after thorough verification, typically take several days to be confirmed.Recounts are mandatory if the margin in any constituency is less than one one-thousandth of the votes cast. Additional recounts can also be requested by candidates or voters if warranted.Unlike the US, where elections are run at the state level, Canada's federal election is administered nationally by Elections Canada, a neutral, independent agency.","Canadians head to the polls today in a crucial federal election.

According to AP, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Red Eléctrica to follow efforts.Both countries have a combined population of over 50 million people.The reason behind the outage was not immediately identified. However, Spain's government is working ""to identify origin"" of the blackout, the PM's office said.Taking to X, Spain's state electricity network operator Red Electrica claimed that it managed to restore power in the north and south of the country.A French operator said that southwest France was hit by a brief power cut but it was restored. Meanwhile, the European Union said that it is in contact with Spain and Portugal to understand the cause of the blackout .Barajas international airport in Madrid was left without power, and other airports in the region have also come to a standstill.According to Euronews Portugal, several passengers were stranded in the metros in Spain and Portugal, with trains stuck in the tunnels between stations.Spain's public broadcaster RTVE reported that the blackout began around 12:30 pm local time, impacting critical infrastructure such as Spain's Parliament, metro stations nationwide, and even RTVE's own newsroom. In Barcelona and nearby towns, residents flooded neighbourhood WhatsApp groups with reports of the blackout.In Portugal, power failures hit Lisbon and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Portuguese distributor E-Redes attributed the disruption to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to local media outlet Expresso. The company said it had to cut electricity in specific regions to stabilise the network. Reports indicated that parts of France were also affected.The outages caused widespread disruptions: mobile phone networks were largely down for voice calls, though some messaging apps remained functional. In Lisbon, the subway reportedly ground to a halt and traffic lights in the city center failed, leading to traffic chaos.Authorities in both countries have yet to provide an estimate of how many people were affected or how long it will take to fully restore services.","Blackout began around 12:30 pm local time in Spain, Portugal, Belgium and part of southern France.

A day meant for learning and laughter turned into a nightmare in Chatham, Illinois, when a woman barreled her Jeep through a daycare and after-school camp on Monday, killing four children and leaving a trail of devastation in her wake.Illinois State Police said the crash occurred around 3:20 pm (local time) at the YNOT After School Camp, just south of Springfield.Without warning, the vehicle tore through the east side of the building, mowing down three victims outside and striking another inside before smashing out through the west wall, leaving behind a gaping hole, crushed debris, and stunned witnesses.All four victims, believed to be between 4 and 18 years old, died from their injuries.

NEW YORK: A brooklyn women was chased, surrounded and beaten by a pro-israel mob, the incident occurred Thursday evening outside the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters in Crown Heights, where Ben-Gvir, Israel's security minister, was set to speak. Clashes broke out between pro-Palestinian activists and members of the local Orthodox Jewish community, with videos showing protesters and counterprotesters engaging in intense altercations.The woman, a resident in her 30s, was surrounded by a crowd of Jewish men and boys. While the reason for the crowd’s actions was unclear, the situation escalated with chants of ""death to Arabs"" and racial slurs, as well as physical attacks. At one point, a man threw a traffic cone at her head before police managed to get her into a patrol car.The Associated Press reported that she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 pm, but by then the protest had mostly dispersed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.""As soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,"" said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.""I had nowhere to go."" ""They were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting 'death to Arabs.' I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,"" she said.The woman described feeling feareed, unsure of where to go, and said the police officer who tried to protect her was unable to stop the mob from following them for blocks. She was eventually driven away to safety. The woman, left bruised and shaken, called for an investigation into the incident as a hate crime. She expressed fear for her safety in the neighborhood where she had lived for years.Police arrested one person and issued summons to five others after the protests. Mayor Eric Adams condemned the violence, saying Sunday that police were investigating ""a series of incidents stemming from clashing protests on Thursday that began when a group of anti-Israel protesters surrounded the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, a Jewish house of worship in Brooklyn.""He added that police had spoken to a different woman on the pro-Palestinian side of the protest who suffered injuries after being harassed by counterprotesters. Photos shared online showed the woman with blood streaming down her face.""Let me be clear: None of this is acceptable; in fact, it is despicable,"" Adams added. ""New York City will always be a place where people can peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence, trespassing, menacing, or threatening.""The protest was one of several in recent days against Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist settler leader who is embarking on his first US state visit since joining Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet three years ago. Previously convicted in Israel of racist incitement and support for a terrorist group, he has called on his supporters to confront Palestinians and assert ""Jewish Power.""The incident recalls the 1991 Crown Heights riot, underscoring the ongoing tensions in the area.A Chabad Lubavitch spokesman, Rabbi Motti Seligson, denounced both the anti-Ben-Gvir protesters and the mob that chased the woman.""The violent provocateurs who called for the genocide of Jews in support of terrorists and terrorism, outside a synagogue, in a Jewish neighborhood, where some of the worst antisemitic violence in American history was perpetrated, and where many residents share deep bonds with the victims of October 7, did so in order to intimidate, provoke, and instill fear,"" Seligson said.""We condemn the crude language and violence of the small breakaway group of young people; such actions are entirely unacceptable and wholly antithetical to the Torah's values.

President Donald Trump got a stern reply from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre after Trump wished luck to the people of Canada as it votes. But the wish was not without a reminder that Canada is 'meant' to become the 51st state of the US. A recent poll from Politico and Focaldata revealed that Trump is immensely unpopular in Canada.In a survey of 2,826 Canadians, only 14 per cent viewed Trump favorably, while 75 per cent viewed him unfavorably. Conservatives were more likely to view him favorably, but still only 24 per cent said they do, while 61 per cent view him unfavorably. A Leger poll, conducted among 1,550 Canadians from February 14 to February 17, found that 13 per cent view Trump favorably, while 74 per cent view him unfavorably. People who said they don't know enough about him made up 7 per cent, while 6 per cent said they weren't sure.Earlier, a YouGov poll of 1,030 people from January 22 to January 28 found that 21 per cent of Canadians viewed Trump favorably, while 72 per cent viewed him unfavorably. Another 6 per cent said they didn't know how they viewed him.""Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st.

ALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE! America can no longer subsidize Canada with the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year that we have been spending in the past. It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!"" Trump said.Poilievre asked Trump to stay out of the issue that concerns only Canadians and said, ""President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box.""""Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.""""Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength,"" Poiliviere said.","A recent poll from Politico and Focaldata revealed that Trump is immensely unpopular in Canada.

MEMPHIS: Three former Memphis police officers were frustrated, angry and full of adrenaline when they fatally beat Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop in 2023, a prosecutor said Monday during opening arguments in their trial on second-degree murder charges .Prosecutor Paul Hagerman showed the jury video of the beating in the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges. The three already face the prospect of years behind bars after they were convicted of federal charges last year.A police pole camera captured the beating just steps from the home where Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, lived with his mother and stepfather. That footage led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the US, and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city.Hagerman said Nichols was being held by his arms by two of the officers as he was punched and kicked and hit with a police baton.Hagerman said the officers helped each other beat Nichols to death. An autopsy showed Nichols died three days after the beating of blunt force trauma.He said the officers had a duty to stop the beating but none of them did so. They were ""overcome by the moment,"" the prosecutor said.""Nobody is going to call them monsters,"" Hagerman said. ""It doesn't take monsters to kill a man.""Defence attorneys will deliver their opening statements later Monday.The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defence lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.Two other officers, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., also have been charged but will not stand trial with their former colleagues. Martin and Mills are expected to change their not guilty pleas in state court, according to lawyers involved in the case. Sentencings for all five officers in the federal case is expected after the state trial.Police video showed officers pepper-spraying Nichols and hitting him with a Taser before he ran away from the traffic stop on Jan. 7, 2023. The five officers, who are all Black, chased down Nichols and beat him. The video showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled.After Nichols' death, five officers were fired, charged in state court and indicted by a federal grand jury on civil rights and witness tampering charges.Martin and Mills pleaded guilty to the federal charges under deals with prosecutors. The other three officers were convicted in October of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating. Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges of using excessive force and being indifferent to Nichols' serious injuries.Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but he was convicted of two lesser charges of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury.In December, the US Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.The department is more than 50% Black and Police Chief Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis is Black.The five officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that since has been disbanded. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders with the goal of amassing arrests, while sometimes using force against unarmed people.","Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith have pleaded not guilty to state charges.

MEXICO CITY: Mexico on Monday criticized a threat by US President Donald Trump's administration to restrict livestock imports over a pest control row, fanning tensions between the major trade partners.Trump's Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned in a letter released Saturday that Washington would restrict imports of live cattle unless Mexico acts to help control a screwworm fly outbreak by Wednesday.She said that Washington was ""very concerned"" about the countries' joint campaign against the outbreak in southern Mexico.The United States complained that its southern neighbor was restricting US-contracted planes that release sterile screwworm flies to operating six days a week instead of seven.It also accused Mexican authorities of imposing ""substantial import duties"" on aviation parts, equipment and sterile fly shipments needed for the operations.Asked about the US complaint at her morning news conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that while some aspects were justified, ""others we consider to be excessive.""She said that the Mexican agriculture ministry was in contact with US authorities to explain its efforts to combat the screwworm, whose flesh-eating larvae can kill cattle.The row comes against a backdrop of increased trade tensions between the neighboring countries as a result of US tariffs.While Trump this month left Mexico off the list of nations facing his ""reciprocal tariffs,"" its carmakers as well as steel and aluminum exporters still face damaging duties.Mexico exported just over one million head of cattle to the United States last year, according to estimates by both governments.","US threatens to restrict live cattle imports unless Mexico acts to control a screwworm fly outbreak.

What Trump said to Atlantic



What Trump told to TIME



President Donald Trump in his interview to The Atlantic denied that he asked his Justice Department to look into the legality of his running again in 2028, though he never doused the possibility, and in fact recently said that he was not joking about it. The Constitution prohibits anyone from becoming the president twice but he dropped hints earlier that there are some loopholes which can be worked out.One such option is if Trump runs for vice president in 2028 with JD Vance running for president. If they win, JD Vance can resign, making way for the vice president Trump to become the president once again.Amid speculations over whether this is something the Trump administration is looking at, his organization came out with Trump 2028 hats, T-shirts.The Atlantic interview says: We asked Trump about a rumor we’d heard that he had tasked his Justice Department with looking into the legality of his running again in 2028. He said he hadn’t, but then seemed to leave open the possibility. Was this the rare democratic norm he was unwilling to shatter? “That would be a big shattering, wouldn’t it?” he mused, laughing. “Well, maybe I’m just trying to shatter.” He noted, twice, that his supporters regularly shout for him to seek a third term, but concluded, “It’s not something that I’m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do.” But not, it appears, a hard thing to profit from: The Trump Organization is now selling “Trump 2028” hats.""I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things,"" Trump said about becoming JD Vance's running partner in 2028.","The Constitution prohibits anyone from becoming the president twice but he dropped hints earlier that there are some loopholes which can be worked out.

State of the United States of America.”The resulted land mass would be beautiful with “Free access with NO BORDER,” he envisioned.He defended the proposal by arguing that America could no longer afford to subsidise Canada with the ""Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year that we have been spending in the past. It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!"" he declared.“IT WAS MEANT TO BE!”Responding to Trump's calling, conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre urged him to ""stay out of our election.""""The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,"" Pierre, said.He further added that Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will never be the 51st state.He said, Canadians can vote for change and hence strengthen their country, ""stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.""Earlier, in an exclusive interview with TIME on the occasion of his first 100 days in office, he reffered to the subject of Canada being the 51st state of the US, not as trolling, rather, he actually thinks that is the only way to go.""I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called governor Trudeau. I said, 'Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?'"" he said.Trump’s comments come at a particularly tense time for Canada as the country is heading to vote today.Canada’s elections will be shaped by a series of tensions revolving around Trump with key issues looming around Trump’s annexation threats and trade war.Current PM Mark Carney, who took office in March after Justin Trudeau’s resignation, is leading the Liberal Party into his first general election. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, called the snap election amid growing political pressure and a deepening trade dispute with the United States.Carney, 60, faces a strong challenge from Pierre Poilievre, 45, the leader of the conservative party. Poilievre, who has built his campaign around promises of a smaller government and lower taxes, has strongly criticised Carney's handling of economic issues, accusing him of fostering “woke” policies and mismanaging the nation’s economy. While Poilievre was once leading the polls, recent weeks have seen a tightening race.","The US president took to Truth Social to wish the country good luck.

Poll Do you believe that the recent bombing in South Waziristan was a targeted attack against the peace committee? No Yes

At least seven people were killed and 16 others wounded on Monday after a powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.The blast occurred in Wana, the main city in South Waziristan district, a region once considered a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban.Usman Wazir, a local police chief, was quoted by news agency The Associated Press as saying that the bomb specifically targeted the peace committee office, which publicly opposes the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The committee also plays a role in resolving local disputes. Police officials described the explosion as “powerful,” leaving significant casualties and damage at the scene.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, suspicion quickly turned toward the TTP, which frequently targets security forces, civilians, and organisations seen as collaborating with the Pakistani state.The Pakistani Taliban, while a distinct entity, maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban who took power in Afghanistan in 2021 following the withdrawal of US and Nato troops.The blast came just a day after Pakistan’s military announced it had killed 54 militants during an operation in the neighbouring North Waziristan district. According to AP, those militants had attempted to cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan, underlining the continued volatility along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.The Pakistani Taliban’s resurgence has been a major concern for Islamabad, particularly since many of its leaders and fighters have found safe haven in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.Meanwhile, Pakistan's security situation remains tense in other regions as well. In a separate incident in Balochistan province, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack on April 25, which killed ten Pakistani military personnel and injured three others in Quetta.The BLA said that a remote-controlled IED was used in the attack targeting a bomb disposal squad vehicle.Pakistan continues to face threats from insurgent groups across different provinces. While the TTP focuses mainly on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and border regions, the BLA has carried out a series of deadly attacks in Balochistan.","A powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.

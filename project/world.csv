'Foreign interference on US soil'







Over 40 US lawmakers have written to secretary of state Marco Rubio expressing concern of the ""transnational repression and worsening human rights crisis in Pakistan under the military-backed government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir.

‘Greatest scandals of all time’: Scott Bessent rips NYT for alleged Trump’s ‘fake’ health report; publication hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/greatest-scandals-of-all-time-scott-bessent-rips-nyt-for-alleged-trumps-fake-health-report-publication-hits-back/articleshow/125756260.cms,"'Throw Her Out': Trump Reignites Ilhan Omar 'Married Her Brother' Controversy; Targets Somalians





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent launched a sharp attack on The New York Times at the paper’s own DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday, accusing it of running “distorted” coverage of President Donald Trump’s health while failing to confront questions about former President Joe Biden’s decline.In an onstage exchange with Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bessent said the paper was losing credibility and predicted, “You know, in 20, 30, 40, 50 years, the New York Times is no longer the paper of record,” according to reports from Mediaite. Calling the publication a “fever swamp,” he added that he no longer reads the Times himself, as cited by NYP.Bessent was responding to a Times report that said Trump, 79, had “shorter public days,” later starts and moments in which he appeared fatigued during meetings. He dismissed the story as fabricated: “I read this article, like ‘President Trump is slowing down. President Trump’s mental capacity –’ It is a hundred percent fake. Like he only called me twice at 2 in the morning last week instead of three times.”The Times article also said Trump now holds fewer public events than he did during his first year in office and travels domestically at a slower pace. It cited instances in which Trump’s eyes “drooped” during midday meetings and mentioned undisclosed medical procedures.Bessent countered that a lengthy Cabinet meeting this week showed an engaged president and accused the paper of overlooking the administration’s pace of work.He broadened his criticism to Biden-era coverage, calling it “one of the greatest scandals of all time” and alleging a “cover-up” of Biden’s condition.Sorkin pushed back, arguing their were concerns about the Biden's coverage and the scrutiny had been lacking, it meant examining Trump’s health and rasing questions about it was “probably fair.”Bessent rejected the comparison, saying the Times was inventing narratives: “Where was the New York Times? We just had a three-hour cabinet meeting yesterday, Andrew!” He questioned how anyone could “invoke the 25th Amendment” if cabinet secretaries seldom met Biden.The exchange came even as the Times reported strong business performance in the last quarter, with more than 12 million subscribers - almost all digital - and nearly half a million new digital-only subscribers added.Speaking later on Fox News, Bessent said he had to fact check the journalist as such reporting will not let people have coorect constuct of ""great second Trump presidency.""“As I got there he immediately went into attack and I just couldn’t take the hypocrisy of it all... I don’t read the Times anymore but people send me articles and the last couple of articles I have got are so far from truth and I think how are people gonna construct narrative of this great second Trump Presidency in an accurate way when a paper of supposed record is so far off.”","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent launched a sharp attack on The New York Times at the paper's own DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday.

'Kill all' for 'martyrdom': How Pakistani immigrant allegedly planned to attack US University of Delaware police campus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kill-all-for-martyrdom-how-pak-immigrant-allegedly-planned-to-attack-us-university-of-delaware-police-campus-details/articleshow/125756393.cms,"Source: New Castle County Police

Who is Luqmaan Khan?







A Pakistan-origin man studying at the University of Delaware was arrested after police discovered a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour, along with a manifesto that allegedly described plans to ""kill all"" and seek ""martyrdom"" in a mass shooting on the University campus, The New York Post reported.Police arrested 25-year-old Luqmaan Khan just before midnight on November 24. Officers found him sitting in his pickup truck in a park after closing hours, and decided to search the vehicle because he was acting suspiciously.Inside the truck, officers allegedly found a .357 Glock pistol, several loaded 27-round magazines, body-armor plates, binoculars, a laptop and a marble composition notebook. Prosecutors said the pistol had been placed into a kit that turned it into a semi-automatic rifle.The police also recovered a notebook reportedly describing a plan to attack his former school’s campus police department, including a drawn-out map of the police headquarters with marked entry and exit points. The plan included evading law enforcement team after attack.ABC 6 reported that the writings included phrases like “kill all – martyrdom,” explained how to escape after the attack, and described how several weapons would be used.Police said the notes clearly showed “premeditated assault plans” and “warfare techniques.”The exact reason for the planned attack is still unknown, but Khan allegedly told police after his arrest that becoming a martyr was “one of the greatest things you can do.”“This case is a quintessential example of federal and state law enforcement collaborating to neutralize a grave threat to Delaware before the worst could come to pass. I want to thank our dedicated law enforcement partners at the FBI and the NCCPD for their exceptional work. As always, we are proud to work with them to keep Delaware safe,” said Acting US Attorney Murray.One campus police officer was specifically mentioned in the notes, but the reason is not yet known.Police told The Post that Khan was born in Pakistan but has lived in the United States since he was a “youth,” and he is now an American citizen.After his arrest, the FBI searched his home in Wilmington and found even more weapons. Agents recovered an AR-style rifle with a red-dot scope and another Glock pistol, which had an illegal device that turned it into a fully automatic machine gun capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute.Khan was taken to the New Castle County Police Headquarters and charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, multiple weapon violations and related offenses.He was arraigned, given a $107,200 cash bail, and then handed over to the FBI, which may file additional charges.","Luqmaan Khan, 25, was arrested after police found a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour in his truck.

‘Not all of us are criminals’: Immigration sweep in New Orleans intensifies; officials aim for maximum arrests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-all-of-us-are-criminals-immigration-sweep-in-new-orleans-intensifies-officials-aim-for-maximum-arrests/articleshow/125755962.cms,"



US immigration officials began an operation in New Orleans on Wednesday to arrest immigrants in the US illegally, federal officials said, making the city the latest target of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration.The Department of Homeland Security said the operation would focus on criminal offenders released from local custody under city policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, Reuters reported.Trump, a Republican, had ordered similar operations in Democratic-led cities across the US, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., in a bid to drive deportations to record levels.The office of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the New Orleans Police Department.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a Republican, has supported federal immigration enforcement efforts and reiterated his backing in a Wednesday interview with local radio. Landry’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Residents and local officials in cities targeted by the immigration crackdown have pushed back, saying Border Patrol and ICE agents have swept up many people with no criminal record and have used heavy-handed tactics that endangered residents.In one family-owned restaurant in New Orleans, a woman assembled makeshift beds so family members could sleep there to avoid potentially being profiled by federal agents while travelling between home and work. The woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Abby, said her family came to the US from Mexico two decades ago but that she and others have not been able to obtain legal status. She said she worried that she could be arrested by immigration authorities and separated from her 10-year-old son, a US citizen. ""Not all of us are criminals,"" she said. ""We're hardworking people. We're people who get up early to achieve our goals and fight for our dreams.""The Latino population in the New Orleans metro area rapidly increased after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. Many undocumented Latino migrants flocked to the city to help rebuild in the wake of Katrina’s destruction, immigrant rights groups say, and now comprise upward of 20% of residents in Jefferson Parish, directly to the west of the city proper, according to Census data.Members of immigrant rights group Union Migrante posted videos and photos showing Border Patrol agents questioning workers and making arrests at home improvement stores across the New Orleans metropolitan area.Union Migrante volunteer Rachel Taber said Border Patrol agents told her to stay back 25 feet as she recorded them questioning roofing workers at a home in the Kenner area of New Orleans on Wednesday. ""I'm doing this for my neighbours, for justice, our democracy, for the people who helped rebuild our houses after Katrina,"" said Taber, an immigrant justice organiser, adding that she was aware of at least 10 arrests on Wednesday by federal agents.""Immigrants are the fabric of the United States. The real criminals are in the White House."" Taber said immigrant workers and school children were staying home across the city as the immigration operation began. ""Business in New Orleans has been paralyzed,"" she said. ""People are having to choose between their jobs and their families.""New Orleans city council member Lesli Harris said the enforcement operation was causing fear and anxiety in the city, telling CNN that ""what we're learning is that they are targeting people who are here legally … who are mothers of children, high school students.”The operation in New Orleans was expected to run through the end of the year but its scope remains unclear.Last month a US official told Reuters that Gregory Bovino, a US Border Patrol official who has led Trump’s crackdown in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, had plans to head to New Orleans. Bovino on Wednesday confirmed he was in the city, writing on social media that ""we are here arresting criminals who should not be here. The state, local and federal law enforcement partners in Louisiana are excellent partners!""Last month a federal judge terminated a 2013 consent decree that had limited the ability of the New Orleans Police Department to assist federal immigration enforcement. Still, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said in late November that the city would not enforce federal immigration law. The Department of Justice labelled New Orleans a ""sanctuary city"" in a list published in August.The action in New Orleans, with a population of around 384 000, follows a Border Patrol-led operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.","Immigration officials began an operation in New Orleans on Wednesday to arrest immigrants in the US illegally, federal officials said.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

‘Looks like the CEO shooter’: 911 call by McDonald's worker played during Luigi Mangione hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/looks-like-the-ceo-shooter-911-call-by-mcdonalds-worker-played-during-luigi-mangione-hearing/articleshow/125707292.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

Putin Plans Big India Reset With More Indian Goods, Deep Strategic Defence Ties In Talks With Modi

India’s Growing Imports of Russian Crude Oil

Russia's position in India's oil procurement landscape has seen a substantial shift since the Ukraine conflict. Prior to 2021, Russian supply was minimal, with yearly crude purchases hovering around $2-3 billion, constituting just 1-2% of India's total oil acquisitions.

This scenario altered significantly in 2022, with purchases reaching $25.5 billion, increasing Russia's contribution to approximately 15% of India's crude imports, as sanctions redirected Russian oil towards Asian markets at reduced prices.

The figures escalated in 2023, with imports reaching $48.6 billion, pushing Russia's share to 34.6%, establishing it as India's primary oil supplier, surpassing traditional Gulf sources.

In 2024, the value increased to $52.7 billion, with Russia's portion reaching 37.3% of total crude imports. This three-year transition has fundamentally altered India's energy security considerations and increased its involvement in global oil sanctions politics.

India-Russia: Trade & Defence Dynamics





What will be the outcome of Putin’s India visit?

GTRI envisions two scenarios as outcomes of Putin’s visit to India:

Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s India visit this week is being closely watched by the world - what will it mean for India’s trade dynamics with both Russia and the US. Will India bring down its crude oil imports from Russia or look to maintain its autonomy while navigating pressure from US President Donald Trump? The answer is not straightforward - laced in geopolitical, economic and diplomatic issues!Putin is making his first diplomatic visit to India since the conflict in Ukraine started, marking a crucial diplomatic milestone amidst complex geopolitical circumstances. Discounted Russian crude has reshaped India’s energy security but deepened its exposure to sanctions and geopolitical risk, says Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative.The visit occurs at a complex time. India faces continuous US pressure regarding its Russian oil purchases whilst being urged to increase access for American products and defence equipment in its markets.“Putin’s visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics. The visit is ultimately not about choosing sides—but about managing dependence in a fractured world,” GTRI says.History explains the resilience of the partnership. During the Cold War, the United States backed Pakistan and deployed the USS Enterprise during the 1971 war.The Soviet Union responded with weapons support and diplomatic shielding at the United Nations. Moscow stood by India after its 1962 war with China, provided repeated diplomatic backing over Kashmir, and remained a defence partner after India’s 1998 nuclear tests brought Western sanctions. “ Over decades, Russia transferred strategic technologies the West withheld. Even today, about 60–70% of India’s military platforms remain of Russian origin. The partnership was built in conflict, not commerce,” the think tank says.Also Read | Trump sanctions: India’s crude imports from Russia at 5-month high - can it continue? According to GTRI, India’s current engagement with Russia rests on three pillars—energy, defence and diplomacy. Energy now dominates the relationship.Russia has become India’s largest crude oil supplier, accounting for as much as 30–35% of total oil imports, turning discounted crude into the foundation of the partnership.Defence forms the second pillar. Russia continues to supply and service a majority of India’s frontline platforms—fighter jets, submarines, tanks and air defence systems—and talks continue on maintenance support and future acquisitions.The third pillar is diplomatic coordination through multilaterals including BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the Eastern Economic Forum, alongside cooperation in nuclear power, space exploration, fertilizers and connectivity.Even as India deepens relations with Washington, Brussels and Tokyo, it treats Moscow as essential to its strategic autonomy, notes GTRI.Russia has emerged as India's main oil supplier, making up approximately one-third of total crude imports in 2024. A substantial increase in India's expenditure on Russian oil is evident, rising from $2.3bn in 2021 to $52.7bn in 2024 - a significant shift in energy procurement patterns.Financial sanctions have necessitated alternative payment arrangements. Following Russia's partial SWIFT exclusion, payments now involve multiple currencies: dirhams (60-65%), rupees (25-30%), and yuan (5-10%). Approximately ₹60,000 crore in rupees remain largely unutilised in dedicated Indian accounts. Russian preference has shifted towards UAE dirham settlements, offering better spending and conversion flexibility. Yuan transactions occur periodically. While functional, this arrangement remains susceptible to instability and political pressures.“In energy, New Delhi is expected to pursue long-term crude contracts with Non US sanctioned Russian firms like Lukoil and Roseneft, revival of Indian investments in Russian energy projects, and advancement of nuclear cooperation beyond Kudankulam. Cooperation in critical minerals, manufacturing and maritime connectivity linking India with Russia’s Far East may also be discussed,” says GTRI.Also Read | India’s love for Russian oil continues? State refiners pick non-sanctioned crude at higher discounts; but will Moscow remain top supplier? GTRI points out the defence relationship remains vital, as approximately two-thirds of India's military equipment comes from Russia, linking operational capability to Russian components and modernisation programmes.Indian defence officials plan to request faster delivery of additional S-400 Triumf systems whilst seeking assurances regarding maintenance and upgrades for Russian-origin equipment. Discussions about the Su-57 stealth fighter are anticipated, though primarily as a long-term prospect rather than immediate acquisition.India's exports to Russia stand at approximately $5bn annually, whilst imports, primarily energy-related, reach nearly $64bn. India’s export footprint in Russia is narrow, with pharmaceuticals and machinery strong but garments, electronics and consumer goods negligible. Payments are increasingly de-dollarised, routed through UAE dirhams, rupees and yuan, reflecting the workaround economy created by sanctions, says GTRI.Trade figures between India and Russia show a significant imbalance, with limited export expansion but substantial energy-focused imports. Indian exports increased from $4.3 billion in FY24 to $4.9 billion in FY25, achieving $2.25 billion during April-September 2025.The exports concentrate primarily on industrial and chemical products, with machinery ($367.8 million), pharmaceuticals ($246 million), and organic chemicals ($165.8 million) constituting the main share in FY26's first half. Other sectors show minimal presence: smartphones ($75.9 million), Vannamei shrimp ($75.7 million), meat ($63 million), and garments ($20.94 million), reflecting India's restricted access to Russian consumer markets and electronics sectors despite strategic shifts.Russian imports maintain their dominance, reaching $63.2 billion in FY24 and $63.8 billion in FY25, with April-September 2025 recording $31.2 billion. The import composition heavily features petroleum, specifically crude oil ($23.1 billion) and petroleum products ($2.5 billion), alongside coal ($1.9 billion). Essential imports include fertilisers ($1.3 billion), sunflower seed oil ($633 million), and diamonds ($202 million).This creates an unbalanced trading relationship where India depends on Russia for crucial energy resources and raw materials whilst facing challenges in expanding its value-added exports, creating a trade dynamic susceptible to international commodity price fluctuations.The most likely outcome is a cautious strengthening of existing ties. India could secure firm timelines on defence deliveries, maintenance contracts, and technology upgrades for aircraft, tanks and submarines. Russia, in turn, may lock in long-term energy commitments—including revived Indian equity in LNG fields, multi-year crude supply agreements, and accelerated nuclear plant construction, says GTRI. The two countries may also formalize a new payment framework using the dirham or integrate Russia’s SPFS system with India’s RuPay network. This scenario stabilizes the relationship without significantly raising diplomatic costs, it says.The more ambitious alternative would mark a deeper realignment. “India and Russia could agree on joint production of defence equipment, Indian investment in Russian oil and gas projects such as Arctic LNG 2 or Vostok, and expansion of nuclear cooperation beyond existing reactors,” says the think tank.“Connectivity initiatives like the Chennai–Vladivostok corridor or nodes of the International North–South Transport Corridor could also gain momentum. A structured settlement framework could be unveiled to reduce idle rupee balances. This scenario would reshape India’s Eurasian integration—but potentially provoke sharper Western response,” it adds.“Beyond optics, the summit is about securing fuel, weapons and payments against a world of financial and political fragmentation. For India, the challenge is strategic balance—protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,” concludes GTRI.","Russia's position in India's oil procurement landscape has seen a substantial shift since the Ukraine conflict. Discounted Russian crude has reshaped India’s energy security but deepened its exposure to sanctions and geopolitical risk, says Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738048,imgsize-97656,width-400,resizemode-4/india-russia-trade.jpg"
‘Inhuman agenda’: Sabrina Carpenter slams Trump admin for using her song in 'disgusting' video; White House responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inhuman-agenda-sabrina-carpenter-slams-trump-admin-for-using-her-song-in-disgusting-video-white-house-responds/articleshow/125734612.cms,"Trump Camp Erupts At Sabrina; Abigail Jackson Slams Pop Star Over Ice Music Outrage





Grammy-winning pop star Sabrina Carpenter on Tuesday publicly rebuked the White House after the Trump administration used her song “Juno” in a video promoting its ongoing deportation drive.The clip, posted on X through the official White House account, was part of a series highlighting nationwide ICE raids and featured the track from Carpenter’s album Short n’ Sweet without her consent.Carpenter sharply condemned the use of her music, in a post on X, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”The White House, however, pushed back.In a response to Entertainment Weekly, an official representative said, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter, we won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country.”The official also referenced the singer’s song “Manchild” from her album Man’s Best Friend, adding, “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”Carpenter joins the long list of musicians to object to the Trump administration’s use of copyrighted music in political messaging. Earlier this year, Kenny Loggins demanded the removal of his hit “Danger Zone” from an AI-generated video shared by President Trump on Truth Social depicting him as “King Trump” flying a fighter jet.“Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied… I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us,” Loggins said in a statement.In November, fellow Grammy winner Olivia Rodrigo criticised the administration after her song “All-American B***h” was used in a video promoting self-deportation. “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” she wrote on Instagram.","Grammy-winning pop star Sabrina Carpenter publicly rebuked the White House after the administration used her song “Juno’ in a video promoting its ongoing deportation drive.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said a US delegation had a “very good” meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Washington’s Ukraine peace proposal, adding that the talks gave the “impression” that Putin “would like to end the war.”The comments came a day after US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law met Putin in Moscow for five hours to review proposals outlined in four documents previously submitted to the Kremlin.""Putin had a very good meeting yesterday with Jared Kushner and with Steve Whitkoff. What comes out of that meeting, I can't tell you because it does take two to tango,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, as cited by ANI. ""He (Putin) would like to end the war, that was their impression.""However, despite the extensive five-hour discussion, the two sides only reviewed the broad outlines of the US proposals and did not reach any compromises or agree to hold a new Putin–Trump summit, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.Ushakov noted that while both delegations reviewed possible pathways to a settlement, several key disagreements remained unresolved.""We could agree on some things, and the president confirmed this to his interlocutors,"" Ushakov said. ""Other things provoked criticism, and the president also made no secret of our critical and even negative attitude toward a number of proposals. But the main thing is that a very useful discussion took place.""Ushakov stressed that the talks would remain private. “The discussion was confidential,” he said. “We agreed not to disclose the substance of the negotiations.”He said that meaningful progress has yet to be achieved, though diplomatic engagement “continues.” The Kremlin adviser added that Putin asked Witkoff to pass “a number of important political signals” directly to Trump.The 28-point US peace proposal unveiled last month drew criticism from Ukraine and several European governments, who argued it leaned too far in Moscow’s favor. US officials later said certain provisions had been revised following feedback from Kyiv and European partners.Trump has intensified his push in recent weeks, convinced that Ukraine’s battlefield setbacks and the rising costs for Moscow could move both sides toward a negotiated deal. American officials say that in working to put proposals on paper and present them to both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, more diplomacy has taken place in the past few weeks than in the previous three years, as cited by the New York Times.People familiar with the discussions say negotiations are now moving on four parallel tracks. One focuses on matters related to Ukraine’s sovereignty, including potential limits on the size of its peacetime army and the range of its missiles. The remaining tracks address territorial questions, economic cooperation, and broader European security issues.Tuesday’s meeting marked the sixth and longest session between Witkoff and Putin in Russia this year. For the first time, they were joined by Jared Kushner, who helped negotiate October’s Gaza ceasefire and was a principal architect of the Abraham Accords normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states during Trump’s first term.",US President Donald Trump on Thursday said a US delegation had a “very good” meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

"The 26-minute Tuesday crash, 51% wipeout that deepened Trumps’ crypto woes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-26-minute-tuesday-crash-51-wipeout-that-deepened-trumps-crypto-woes/articleshow/125756080.cms,"US president Donald Trump





The crash Tuesday in the crypto miner American Bitcoin Corp. was instantaneous. At 9.31am on Wall Street, just one minute after trading started, its shares were down 33%. Five minutes later, losses had ballooned to 42% and then, by 9.56am, to more than 50%.It was all so spectacular that American Bitcoin became the symbol of not just the crypto market wipe-out of late 2025 but also the collapse of the myriad ventures that the Trump family has been promoting in the digital-currency world over the past year. For as much as broader crypto markets have sunk these past two months — roughly 25% in the case of bellwether Bitcoin — projects that are tied to the Trump family are down far, far more. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, has seen its WLFI token tumble 51% from its peak in early Sept, more than both Bitcoin and an index of smaller digital tokens. Alt5 Sigma, a company promoted by the Trump sons, has plunged around 75% as it deals with a growing number of legal problems.Then there are the memecoins named after the president and his wife, Melania, which have fallen around 90% and 99% respectively from their record highs back in Jan.American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump, is now down 75% after the big drop on Tuesday. It rose 11% in US premarket trading on Wednesday.These moves have put a dent in the piles of crypto wealth that the first family amassed earlier this year. But they also carry a broader significance for both the digital asset industry and the president’s public image. Trump’s embrace helped boost a wide array of crypto tokens during the early months of his second term and turned the price of Bitcoin into a marker of his political success.Now, though, what looked like a Trump premium has suddenly turned into a Trump drag, taking out one of the central pillars holding up crypto assets and offering an indication of just how quickly confidence in these speculative markets — and even in the president himself — can dissolve. “The Trump presidency has been a double edged sword for legitimacy,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. “Trump started launching his own crypto projects, many of which lost value quickly. If the goal was to achieve legitimacy through the Trump family, that’s not helped.”World Liberty Financial and the firm behind Trump’s memecoin, Fight Fight Fight, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Eric Trump took to social media on Tuesday to blame American Bitcoin’s bad performance on the end of a lockup period for its shares, rather than any broader weakness. “Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched,” he wrote on X. “I’m 100% committed to leading the industry.”The dramatic moves in the assets associated with the Trump family are not new for an industry that has been defined by its volatility. Digital tokens have experienced big drops before, before bouncing back. On Tuesday, as American Bitcoin struggled, the original cryptocurrency had one of its best days in the last few weeks, rising around 6%.","American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump, is now down 75% after the big drop on Tuesday.

"‘President of peace’: US state department rebrands USIP after Trump, ahead of Rwanda-DRC deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-of-peace-us-state-department-rebrands-usip-after-trump-ahead-of-rwanda-drc-deal/articleshow/125755840.cms,"



The US state department on Wednesday announced that the building of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, DC, has been rebranded as the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.This marks the first time the institute has been rededicated under a sitting president’s name. The announcement was made through an official post on X that read: “This morning, the State Department renamed the former Institute of Peace to reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history. Welcome to the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. The best is yet to come.”US secretary of state Marco Rubio, backing the move, wrote on X: “President Trump will be remembered by history as the President of Peace. It's time our State Department display that.”The decision comes ahead of Thursday’s expected signing of a US-brokered peace agreement between the presidents of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to be hosted at the newly labelled building.The renamed sign was also installed outside the institute on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly defended the decision, saying, “Now, the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, which is both beautifully and aptly named after a president who ended eight wars in less than a year, will stand as a powerful reminder of what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability. Congratulations, world!”The claim that Trump ended “eight wars” this year remains widely disputed, with several conflicts - including the Israel-Hamas war - still unresolved.The development has revived scrutiny of the administration’s earlier attempt to take control of USIP. The Trump administration had removed the institute’s board and staff and installed its own leadership before a federal judge ruled the move unlawful, calling it a “gross usurpation of power.”The institute, funded by the US Congress and designed to function independently of the executive branch, has been operating in a limited capacity since the ruling. It did not respond to requests for comment on the renaming.The peace agreement expected to be signed this week follows months of escalating violence in eastern Congo, where the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group seized major cities earlier this year, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. A US-brokered deal was reached in June and is now set for formalisation as the administration turns the spotlight on what it describes as President Trump’s expanding diplomatic legacy.","The building in Washington, DC, has been rebranded as the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on Somali-American community and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, repeating a series of claims while speaking to reporters at the White House. His remarks came after he was asked about Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey saying he was proud the city hosts the largest Somali community in the United States.Responding sharply, Trump said, “Well then he is a fool. I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian community, look at their nation… people just walking around killing each other.” He went on to allege, “These Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country...”Targeting Representative Ilhan Omar, Trump repeated long-running accusations surrounding her personal life, saying, “They have a representative, Ilhan Omar, who they say married her brother. It's a fraud. She tries to deny it now but can’t really deny it, cuz yeah just happened.” He added that she “shouldn't be allowed to be the congresswomen” and should be “thrown hell out of our country.”Trump also blamed the community for what he described as deterioration in Minnesota, saying, “These people have destroyed Minnesota.”He also took aim at the Minnesota governor, “you have a incompetent governor, a crooked governor…he should be ashamed - a beautiful land and a beautiful state is a hell hole right now.Trump further went on to say the only thing Omar and the community does is complain about everything. “These people all they do is complain, complain, complain, You have her she’s always - constitution provides me - go back to your own country and figure out your constitution. All she does is complain about this country and without this country she would be in a very good shape and probably wouldn't be alive,” he said.Linking the arrival of Somali refugees to the Obama administration, Trump said, “What they have done to Minnesota has a lot to do with the governor and a lot to do with Barack Obama because that’s when these people started coming to our country.”His latest remarks come a day after Trump during his cabinet meeting targeted the sommunity by caling Somalis ""garbage'.Responding to the President, congresswomen Omar posted on X, ""His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,"" while reacting to a video where Trump was talking about her.She also responded to Trump's repeated claims of marrying her brother saying she didn't and went on to question if the President is pedophile.""I didn’t but is your President a pedophile?""","US President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Somali-American community and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, repeating a series of claims while speaking to reporters at the White House.

'No problem': Trump backs release of alleged drug boat strike footage; repeats warning of land strikes in Venezuela,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-problem-trump-backs-release-of-alleged-drug-boat-strike-footage-repeats-warning-of-land-strikes-in-venezuela/articleshow/125755685.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would support the release of any footage of the multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat from September 2, while backing the “decision to knock out the boats. ”The Trump administration and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in particular have been under scrutiny in recent days after The Washington Post reported that the US military carried out a subsequent strike on a boat in the Caribbean despite there apparently being survivors. CBS News has not independently confirmed the existence of survivors, but the White House has confirmed the boat was struck more than once on September 2.“I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’ll certainly release, no problem,” the president said of any strike footage.A reporter asked the president in the Oval Office if Hegseth, Adm. Frank Bradley or others should be punished if survivors were indeed clinging to the boat. The administration has suggested that Bradley, the commander of the operation, gave the order for the second strike and was within his rights to do so.The president responded, “I think you’re going to find that this is war,” saying drugs smuggled into the United States have killed millions.“I think you’re going to find that there’s a very receptive ear to doing exactly what they’re doing, taking out those boats,” Trump added.When pressed again on whether he supported a decision to kill survivors, the president said, “No, I support the decision to knock out the boats.”On Sunday, the president told reporters on Air Force One that he “wouldn’t have wanted” a second strike on the boat. Since then, the administration has defended Hegseth and his leadership.The president on Wednesday also repeated an earlier threat that land strikes in Venezuela could begin soon as tensions with President Nicolás Maduro run high. “Very soon, we’re going to start doing it on land, too,” he said. “You know, the land is much easier … And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we’re going to start that very soon, too. ”Trump has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration’s sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is “totally prepared” to carry out land strikes. If the president orders strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration’s anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.The boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn’t provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the US is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.","The president said he would support the release of any footage of the multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat from September 2.

Caribbean strike controversy



Rooted in US campaign against Houthis



The Atlantic





US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is back in the political hot seat as the Pentagon’s watchdog alleged he put American personnel and missions at risk by using the Signal messaging app to share sensitive details about a strike targeting Yemen’s Houthi militants.Trump administration officials used the encrypted app Signal to coordinate sensitive military strikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants in March — and the group chat accidentally included a journalist. Then–national security adviser Mike Waltz set up the chat with several of Trump’s top Cabinet officials but mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.And later, The Atlantic published additional text messages from the Signal group chat, underscoring a massive breach in operational security as specific sensitive information about the Houthi attack was shared in the chat before it was carried out.Sources familiar with the classified report — now parked with the Senate Armed Services Committee — say Hegseth blasted out minute-by-minute updates such as “1215 ET: F-18s LAUNCH” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target” in a Signal chat.The inspector general’s probe — launched in April at lawmakers’ request — examined whether Hegseth sidestepped secure communications and ignored records rules. A redacted public version is expected Thursday, as bipartisan critics argue Hegseth’s real-time “declassification by group chat” put troops at risk, AP news agency reported.Hegseth told the group “We are currently clean on OPSEC” after strikes, celebrating the collapse of a building housing a top Houthi missile commander. But the IG faulted him for using a personal device in violation of policy, noting that even if he had authority to declassify, details remained sensitive while pilots were en route. Critics, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, said those launch-time sequences were “inherently classified” and could have gotten aviators killed if intercepted. Waltz later admitted the accidental add and even sought help from Elon Musk for digital forensics.According to the one of the sources said Hegseth technically has the authority to declassify information, and the review didn’t conclude that he mishandled classified material. But it did find that he violated Pentagon policy by conducting official business from a personal device and recommended better training for Defense Department officials.Hegseth refused an in-person interview with the inspector general, instead submitting a written statement, the person said. He argued that he was allowed to declassify information and only shared details he believed would not jeopardize operations.The early conclusions intensify pressure on the former Fox News host, as lawmakers had already demanded an independent investigation into his use of the commercial app. Members of Congress are also probing a separate report that a follow-up strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean in September killed survivors after Hegseth allegedly ordered forces to “kill everybody.”Hegseth defended that strike as part of the “fog of war,” saying he did not see any survivors but also “didn’t stick around,” and that the admiral in charge “made the right call” in ordering the second attack. He denied any wrongdoing related to the Signal chats, insisting the material was unclassified.“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”President Donald Trump “stands by” Hegseth, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, noting the review confirmed that “no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.”Houthi rebels began firing missiles and drones at commercial and naval ships in late 2023, saying the attacks were aimed at ending Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. Those assaults sharply reduced traffic through the Red Sea, which normally handles about $1 trillion in yearly trade.The US-led response in 2024 became the most sustained naval fight since World War II.A ceasefire in Israel and Gaza began in January but fell apart in March. The US then launched a broad assault on Houthi targets, which ended weeks later after Trump said the group agreed to stop targeting ships. Another Gaza ceasefire took effect in October.After it became public that Hegseth’s Signal chat included’s editor, the magazine published the entire thread in March. The messages showed Hegseth laying out strike windows, target locations, timing elements, and which aircraft and weapons would be used. He also noted the US was “currently clean” on operational security.Hegseth told Fox News in April that what he shared over Signal was “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things.”","Pentagon watchdog says Pete Hegseth violated Pentagon policy by using Signal messaging app to share sensitive details about a strike.

Staff at a Virginia liquor store turned up for work on Saturday to find the aftermath of what looked like a small riot: smashed whisky bottles, liquor pooling across the floor and one very drunk raccoon passed out in the bathroom.The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in”. When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin, having apparently helped itself to the bottom shelf.“He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” Samantha Martin, an animal control officer in Hanover County, told the. BBC News reported that among the wreckage was the animal’s apparent drink of choice: scotch.Only one blurry CCTV still exists of the boozy intruder, so no one knows exactly how much it managed to knock back before losing consciousness. Staff called Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter, and Martin collected the “suspect” for what the shelter jokingly described as questioning.In a Facebook post about the incident, the shelter wrote: “On Saturday morning, Officer Martin responded to an unusual call at the Ashland ABC Store.Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect’ had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then… passed out in the bathroom. The suspect? A very intoxicated raccoon.”The shelter confirmed the animal was, indeed, drunk, but otherwise unharmed. “After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover and poor life choices), he was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer,” the post added. Martin later deadpanned that it was “just another day in the life of an animal control officer”.The Ashland ABC store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter on social media for its professionalism and for giving the visitor “a sober ride home”.The Hanover shelter, which looks after rescued and unwanted animals, says on its website : “The shelter provides veterinarian care for homeless or unwanted animals until they are adopted or placed with an animal rescue organization.”Raccoons are, in many ways, built for this kind of misadventure. They’ve adapted so successfully to human environments that researchers are starting to see physical changes associated with early domestication. “Wherever humans go, there is trash,” Dr Raffaela Lesch, a biologist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, recently told. “Animals love our trash. It’s an easy source of food. All they have to do is endure our presence, not be aggressive, and then they can feast on anything we throw away.”In Ashland, Virginia, one raccoon appears to have taken that principle a step further: skip the bin, go straight for the bar.","The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in” When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752813,imgsize-1157838,width-400,resizemode-4/drunk-raccoon-middle-aged-recently-divorced-rough-week.jpg"

Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA finally broke the silence about Candace Owens' flood of allegations against organization members over Kirk's assassination. For the past two months, right-wing podcaster Candace had moved from one conspiracy theory to another, pinning the blame on Kirk's assassination on the organization members. In a message Wednesday, Turning Point USA said they are inviting Candace for a livestream where the organization would debunk all her false claims. Kirk's organization said they maintained their silence because Candace calls herself a friend of Charlie Kirk but now they won't remain silent anymore, as that's not what Charlie would have done.Candace suggested that Kirk's assassination was an 'inside job' and that Charlie Kirk's Utah Valley University event, where he was killed, seemed unusual. Candace suggested that there was an intentional delay in providing Kirk with first aid. Candace also suggested that many people in Turning Point USA knew they Charlie would be murdered.Candace said Charlie Kirk was 'betrayed' by everyone, alleging financial irregularities in Turning Point USA and also suggested Israeli, French roles in the murder.All that Candace claimed are lies and innuendoes thrown with zero regard to the facts, Turning Point USA said, adding that they could not grieve properly after Charlie's heinous murder as they were being harassed, triggered by Candace's allegations.""For a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, we thought her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. Second, Charlie followed a rule of thumb to not feed the troll and instead focus on the mission. Lastly, we did not respond as Charlie always viewed Candace as a friend and we were holding our hope that she would return that friendship,"" Turning Point USA's Blake Neff said.The organization said they would hold a livestream in Phoenix where Candace would be invited if she is free and Turning Point USA will put forth its facts against Candace's lies. The organization said as their silence had nothing to do with complacency, they are not breaking their silence because of any obligation to Candace, but only because of Charlie as Charlie was not a coward and he would not have allowed such slander.","Right-wing podcaster Candace had moved from one conspiracy theory to another, pinning the blame on Kirk's assassination on the organization members. Turning Point USA said they are inviting Candace for a livestream where the organization would debunk all her false claims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752797,imgsize-739745,width-400,resizemode-4/turning-point-usa-puts-a-stop-to-candace-owens-wild-allegations-on-kirks-murder-and-invites-her-to-live-debate.jpg"

A US-based AI recruitment firm came to IIT-Delhi for placement and assured the students that they will not hesitate to sponsor H-1Bs because of the $100,000 fee that the Donald Trump administration imposed, so that companies rely on American talent and don't import foreign skills. The firm's social media marketing also targeted the H-1B issue, the concerns over the high fees and established their message that the $100,000 fee will not stop them from hiring the best.""We want to work in India for sure. But the exposure one gets abroad, in a diverse and fast-moving environment, is different. Strict visa rules are a big setback. So companies offering sponsorship is a huge thing for us,"" a student told news agency PTI.According to social media buzz, the AI company is San Francisco's Metaview, and the company's co-founder ran a similar campaign after the Trump administration announced the H-1B visa fee. Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the co-founder and CTO, said $100,000 is a rounding error compared to the value each member of the team creates. ""If you're on an H-1B visa and your company doesn't value you enough to pay the $100k, check out to see if any of our roles might be a fit,"" he wrote.""I'm seeing many companies from other countries using this as an opportunity to say, ""come work in country X."" That feels a bit desperate to me. Instead, come work with @MetaviewAI -- right here in San Francisco -- where $100K is a rounding error compared to the value each member of our team creates. Our team is ready to move fast and get to an offer/no-offer decision on any candidate within 24 hours of first contact. However, there's a catch. Candidates should spare 4-5 hours of their time for interviews,"" Tajbaksh wrote.""Our company is looking to expand in the US, and we plan to submit more H-1B petitions in the next lottery. One executive order will not change my belief that an organization's success or failure is a function of its people,"" Tajbaksh told Business Insider, explaining his social media post. Tajbaksh came to the US through EB-1A visa which is an employment-based visa meant for those with extraordinary abilities in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics.The H-1B row has again taken the centerstage after President Donald Trump said in a Fox interview that US needs certain talents from outside, riling up a section of MAGA who wants the H-1B program to be suspended.","US-based AI recruitment firm came to IIT-Delhi for placement and assured the students that they will not hesitate to sponsor H-1Bs because of the $100,000 fee.

Explained: What Tennessee’s election reveals about 2026 battlefield for Democrats and Republicans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-what-tennessees-election-reveals-about-2026-battlefield-for-democrats-and-republicans/articleshow/125751079.cms,"Trump On Edge As Brutal Tennessee Race Threatens Deep-Red District To Flip Blue | Watch





A surprisingly competitive special election in deep-red Tennessee revealed one of the most important early signals about the 2026 midterms: both parties believe affordability will decide the political battlefield, and Democrats are beginning to claw back voters they lost last year.Republican Matt Van Epps won the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, defeating Democratic state lawmaker Aftyn Behn by nine points. On paper, the race should not have been close. US President Donald Trump carried the district with about 60 percent of the vote in 2024, and former Representative Mark Green won it by similar margins before resigning in July.Yet millions of dollars in late spending and a clear double-digit swing towards the Democrats transformed what should have been a routine Republican hold into a nationally watched contest. Democratic gains in urban and suburban pockets of Nashville were similar to the party’s overperformances in dozens of special elections this year.Van Epps celebrated the result as a win powered by the MAGA chief’s continued influence. “Running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win,” he said, thanking the president for “unwavering support” and promising to be “all-in with him” in Congress, according to NPR.Trump said the same in a Truth Social message, telling GOP supporters it was “another great night for the Republican Party.”Both parties focussed on ads centred heavily on cost-of-living issues. Van Epps promised to lower prices, expand jobs and cut health-care costs. Behn vowed to “shake up Washington” by making health care affordable and easing the burden on workers and small businesses. Even so, Trump dismissed affordability altogether during a tele-rally, claiming Democrats used the topic as “a con job.”Republicans will now hold a 220-213 House majority until Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene resigns in early January.","Republican Matt Van Epps won the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, defeating Democratic state lawmaker Aftyn Behn by nine points.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

The ruling dispensation in Pakistan appears threatened,"" he said.Controversy swirls around the health of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan due to a lack of transparency about his confinement conditions.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Kasim Khan claims his father has been kept in a 'death cell with zero transparency' Islamabad refutes rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was 'brutally' assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her sister Sheikh Rehana and Hasina’s niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq were on Monday sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for ‘irregularities’ in allocation of plots under the Purbachal New Town project.Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 pronounced the verdict. Hasina, already sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, was handed five years’ imprisonment, while Rehana got seven years and Tulip Siddiq two years of jail.The court found Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, guilty of misusing her “special influence” as a British politician to coerce Hasina into giving valuable pieces of land to her mother and siblings.Bangladesh does not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (UK), and it is unlikely Siddiq will serve the sentence. The Labour party said it was not recognising the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.Siddiq said, “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.” “The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by politics of Bangladesh,” the Guardian quoted her as saying.","Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid, the state-run BSS news agency reported. The court also imposed a fine of $813 each on Hasina, Rehana, and Siddiq, and ordered the cancellation of the plot allotted to Rehana.According to The Dhaka Tribune, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed six separate cases between January 12 and 14 over alleged irregularities in the allocation of plots under the Purbachal project. The ACC alleged that Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, unlawfully secured six plots, each measuring 10 kathas (7,200 sq ft), in the diplomatic zone of Sector 27 for herself, her children Joy and Putul, sister Rehana, niece Siddiq, and other relatives, despite being ineligible under existing regulations. Charges were framed against 29 people, including Hasina’s children Sajeeb Wazed Joy and Saima Wazed Putul, as part of multiple cases filed in January 2025.Tulip Siddiq, who represents Hampstead and Highgate in Britain’s Parliament, had previously denied the allegations, calling the trial “a farce built on ‘fabricated accusations and driven by a clear political vendetta’.” In January, she resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Cabinet, saying she had been cleared of wrongdoing but stepped down because the issue was becoming “a distraction from the work of the government,” AP quoted.This verdict is one among several against Hasina. Earlier this month, a separate Dhaka court sentenced her to 21 years in jail across three corruption cases over the same Purbachal project, with consecutive seven-year terms and fines of Tk 1 lakh per case. Joy and Putul were also sentenced to five years each in related cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Mass protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, ending her rule after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court. She was also sentenced to death in absentia in November for her role in the violent crackdown on student-led protests, termed the “July Uprising”, and had previously been declared a fugitive.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Touhid Hossain said the interim government expects India to consider Hasina’s extradition “at the earliest possible time,” now that judicial proceedings against her are complete.The country is currently run by an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has announced that the next parliamentary elections will be held in February.","All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid. The court also imposed a fine of $813 each on Hasina, Rehana, and Tulip Siddiq. Charges were framed against 29 people, including Hasina’s children.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125688830,imgsize-1212915,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-12-01t131111.jpg"

Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations, a central bank official confirmed on Sunday.Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has selected China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation to design, print and supply notes of NRs 50, NRs 500 and NRs 1,000, spokesperson Guru Prasad Paudel told PTI. Under the newly awarded contract, the company must deliver the notes within nine months.Paudel said the NRB provides the technical specifications, after which the Chinese firm prepares a design that must be approved by the central bank before printing begins.Earlier this month, the same Chinese company also received a Letter of Intent to design and print 430 million pieces of the NRs 1,000 denomination.The upcoming NRs 1,000 note will feature seven rhododendrons, Nepal’s national flower, representing the country’s seven provinces. It will also carry the signature of the current governor, Prof Dr Biswo Nath Poudel, appearing for the first time in this banknote series.China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation was selected on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid and has previously printed Nepalese notes of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 500.Meanwhile, on Thursday, Nepal’s central bank issued new Rs 100 notes carrying a revised national map that includes the Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura regions -- territories that India maintains belong to it. Nepal claims these areas, lying east of the Mahakali river, fall within its borders according to the 1816 Sugauli Treaty.These disputed territories were incorporated into Nepal’s political map in May 2020 by the K P Sharma Oli government, a move later endorsed by Parliament. India had sharply criticised the updated map at the time, calling it a unilateral and unacceptable “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims.NRB officials noted that Nepal’s Rs 1 and Rs 2 coins have already been minted with the revised map for the past two years.","Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations.

Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term

'Can issue one-time travel pass to Zia's son'





DHAKA: Bangladesh's request for the extradition of convicted former PM Sheikh Hasina will not affect the broader relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said on Sunday.He emphasised that Dhaka will continue to pursue its priorities, including the Teesta water-sharing agreement and ending ""border killings"", regardless of the extradition issue. ""Since she (Hasina) is convicted, we surely want her extradition to implement the punishment. I do not think other issues will get stuck because of this,"" Hossain said.Hossain reiterated Bangladesh's consistent desire to maintain a good working relationship with India based on mutual respect and shared interests. Though the past govt (Hasina) enjoyed a ""warm"" relationship with India, it failed to resolve longstanding issues such as Teesta water sharing and ""border killings"" in its 15 years in office, he said.On Pakistan, the adviser said bilateral ties had been ""deliberately kept in a bad situation"" for years during the past regime. ""Our decision was to establish normal ties with Pakistan, nothing extraordinary,"" he added.Hossain said the govt can issue a ""one-time"" travel pass within a single day to facilitate BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman's return if he wishes to come back. Rahman has been living in exile in the UK for the past 17 years. He said sthe one-time pass is issued in cases where a person does not have a valid passport or the passport has expired. ""It's for one-time use. It takes only a day to issue such a pass.""","Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Dhaka will continue to pursue its priorities, including the Teesta water-sharing agreement and ending ""border killings"" He reiterated Bangladesh's consistent desire to maintain a good working relationship with India based on mutual respect and shared interests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125683233,imgsize-959576,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"

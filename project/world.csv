Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk had a ""productive meeting"" with Candace Owens, signalling a possible thaw in their rift following weeks of public tension in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.“Had a very productive conversation with @RealCandaceO,” Kirk said. “More to come from both of us. Looking forward to AmFest this week. Time to get back to work.”In a separate update on X, Candace Owens echoed the message, describing their hours-long meeting as exceeding her expectations in terms of agreement.“Erika and I had an extremely productive 4 1/2 hour meeting that I think we both feel should have taken place a lot earlier than it did,” Owens said. “We agreed much more than I had anticipated. Of course, we also disagreed on various points and people as well. Most importantly, we were able to share intel and clarify intent.”Critics have accused Owens of peddling conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Owens added that the conversation immediately helped ease tensions and said she would provide further updates on Tuesday.“I will of course have a full rundown for you all tomorrow as I am currently exhausted, but I wanted to quickly let you guys know that absolutely nothing was held back and the immediate result was that tensions were thawed,” Owens said.The discussion represents a bid by both women to address weeks of online conspiracy-related tensions following Charlie Kirk’s assassination.","Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk had a ""productive meeting"" with Candace Owens, signalling a possible thaw in their rift.

Trump Seizes 'Largest Oil Tanker' Off Venezuela; Daredevil Operation or Theft? | Dramatic Video





The US military has carried out what it described as a “lethal kinetic strike” against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern Pacific, killing eight people, according to US Southern Command.The operation, conducted on December 15 under the direction of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, marks the latest escalation in Washington’s aggressive maritime campaign against what it calls narco-terrorist networks operating in the region.Southern Command said Joint Task Force Southern Spear targeted three boats travelling along known narcotics routes. Intelligence assessments concluded the vessels were actively engaged in drug trafficking and operated by organisations designated by the US as terrorist groups. Three men were killed on the first vessel, two on the second and three on the third, the command said, adding that all those killed were “male narco-terrorists”.The strike comes against the backdrop of a wider US pressure campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, particularly focused on Venezuela. In recent months, US naval forces have expanded their presence in the region, alongside sanctions and high-profile seizures of vessels accused of transporting illicit oil and drugs. US officials say the operations are aimed at disrupting networks that fund armed groups and hostile regimes through narcotics and smuggling.",US military carried out what it described as a ‘lethal kinetic strike’ against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern Pacific.

Putin’s Men ‘CHANGE’ Front With New Capture, KILL 1450+ Ukraine Troops As Berlin Talks Struggle





US president Donald Trump on Monday said a peace deal to end the four-year-long war between Ukraine and Russia is “closer than ever,” citing ongoing talks between European leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.Trump said the United States is receiving “tremendous support” from European countries, including Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands, all of which he said are keen to see an end to the conflict.""We are going to get it done. I think we are closer now, and they will tell you that they are closer now with numerous conversations with President Putin of Russia. And I think we are closer now than we have ever been... We want to save a lot of lives,"" Trump said, speaking at the White House. ""We are getting closer. We are having tremendous support from European leaders that want to get it ended also,"" he added.The US President also acknowledged the difficulty of bringing Russia and Ukraine into agreement on both the timing and the terms of a potential settlement. Trump added that while he has expressed optimism in the past, his expectations have previously been undermined by setbacks from one side or the other.""At this moment, Russia wants to get it, but the problem is they will want to end it, and all of a sudden they want it, and Ukraine will want to get it ended and all of a sudden they won't. We have to get them on the same page,"" Trump said.The assessment followed two days of talks in Berlin involving officials from Europe, Ukraine and the United States. Trump was represented at the discussions by his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Trump also joined a dinner of European leaders by phone on Monday to discuss the emerging framework of an agreement, and held two separate calls with Witkoff and Kushner as the talks progressed.“Things are seemingly going well, but we’ve been saying that for a long time, and it’s a difficult one,” Trump had said after the call.A US official said earlier on Monday that around 90 per cent of the issues between Russia and Ukraine have been resolved, with territorial concessions remaining a key point of contention. The official added that the US had put forward “thought-provoking” proposals to break the deadlock, including the creation of an “economic free zone,” as cited by CNN.European leaders, meanwhile, have agreed to participate in any Western security guarantees for Ukraine, though control over territory continues to be one of the main obstacles, according to Al Jazeera.Separately, Ukrainian Zelenskyy has previously indicated that Kyiv is prepared to relinquish its bid for Nato membership in exchange for firm security assurances from Western partners.Discussions this week also covered plans for Ukraine’s reconstruction, with representatives from investment firm BlackRock holding talks with Ukrainian officials on potential financial support. The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was also raised, though the issue remains unresolved.Meanwhile, overnight Russian forces launched 153 drones at Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials, who said 17 of them reached their targets. Russia’s defence ministry, in a separate claim, said its air defences shot down 130 Ukrainian drones.",Donald Trump says a peace deal to end Ukraine-Russia conflict is 'closer than ever' He says the United States is receiving 'tremendous support' from European leaders.

"‘Acted intentionally, maliciously’: Trump sues BBC over edited Jan 6 speech; seeks $10bn in defamation claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/acted-intentionally-maliciously-trump-sues-bbc-over-edited-capitol-speech-seeks-5bn-in-defamation-claim/articleshow/125993435.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Photo credit: AP)

BBC’s response so far

What the edited clip showed?





US President Donald Trump on Monday filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the BBC, accusing Britain’s public service broadcaster of misleadingly editing a speech he delivered to supporters in Washington on January 6, 2021, shortly before the US Capitol was stormed, news agency AP reported.The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol sought to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the violence.According to Reuters, the lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami. Trump has alleged that edited clips aired by the BBC falsely suggested he urged supporters to storm the Capitol, causing him serious reputational and financial damage.Trump claims the broadcaster stitched together excerpts from different parts of his speech including remarks urging supporters to march to the Capitol and another in which he said “fight like hell” — while excluding a passage calling for peaceful protest. He argues that the edit created a misleading impression of a direct call for violence.The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, according to The Guardian.However, the broadcaster has previously apologised, conceding an “error of judgment”, and acknowledged that the edit gave a mistaken impression. It has maintained that there is no legal basis for a defamation claim.In a statement issued earlier, a BBC spokesperson said lawyers had replied to Trump’s legal notice, adding: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”The disputed clip featured in an episode of Panorama broadcast shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. The controversy triggered one of the biggest crises in the BBC’s 103-year history and led to the resignations of director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness last month, The Guardian reported. The broadcaster has said it does not intend to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms.According to The Guardian, the edit drawn from sections of Trump’s speech delivered almost an hour apart gave the impression that he told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team said the edited footage, aired in the run-up to the 2024 election, amounted to a “brazen attempt” to interfere in the contest. “The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda,” the spokesperson said. “President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference. ”The row intensified after the leak of a BBC memo by an external editorial standards adviser, which raised concerns over how the programme had been edited as part of a wider review into alleged political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster. The documentary was not aired in the United States.Trump’s lawyers argue that the BBC acted “intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively”. In the filing, Trump is seeking damages of at least $10 billion.Speaking earlier to reporters, Trump said: “We’ll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably sometime next week. I think I have to do it. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth,” as quoted by the BBC. In a separate interview, he said: “I think I have an obligation to do it. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.”Legal experts cited by Reuters say Trump faces a high legal threshold under US law. As a public figure, he must prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory, but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, given strong constitutional protections for free speech and the press.The BBC is expected to argue that the programme was substantially accurate, that its editing did not materially distort the meaning of the speech, or that Trump’s reputation was not harmed. In the UK, defamation claims must be filed within a year of publication, a deadline that has passed for the Panorama episode which may explain why Trump has chosen to sue in the US.Trump’s lawsuit argues that the Florida court has jurisdiction because the BBC conducts “substantial” business in the state, including through its website and the BritBox streaming service, which operates in the US.The case adds to a series of legal actions Trump has brought against media organisations. While CBS and ABC have settled lawsuits with him following his 2024 election victory, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and an Iowa newspaper have denied wrongdoing in cases filed against them.","US President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the BBC.

In the Brown University shooting case, the police dropped new details about the suspect, who killed two students and injured 9 people on Saturday.The Providence Police Department released surveillance videos on Monday that showed a person of interest walking around the area of Brown University on Saturday, two hours before the deadly shooting at the campus.In one 00:13 clip, the individual, wearing a mask and a dark two-tone jacket, walked on a sidewalk by a picket fence at around 2 pm on Saturday, officials said. A 00:08 surveillance video shown during the Monday press conference showed an individual wearing what appears to be a mask crossing a street.In a 00:09 clip, the same individual was seen walking on a sidewalk next to an iron gate. Officials also displayed photos of the person, who appeared to be wearing dark clothing.This came a day after they released a person of interest in the case.That marked a setback in the investigation of Saturday’s attack on the Ivy League university campus and added to questions about the shooting and the probe.

Ilia Topuria domestic violence allegations spark explosive response from Bryce Mitchell



Ilia Topuria UFC leave explained as champion denies allegations and cites extortion



Tension around the UFC lightweight title intensified this week after Ilia Topuria confirmed a pause in his fighting schedule. The speculation about his career shifted quickly into a serious public dispute involving personal allegations and legal claims. The situation has drawn attention far beyond the cage, placing the undefeated champion at the center of one of the sport’s most volatile moments this year.As Topuria stepped away to address matters that he says threaten his family and reputation, a former rival chose a very different response. Bryce Mitchell resurfaced with a blistering message that reignited their history and added fuel to an already heated conversation across the MMA world.Bryce Mitchell, who lost to Ilia Topuria at UFC 282, posted a video that mixed personal grievance with harsh condemnation. Referencing past mockery, he escalated his criticism with graphic language and accusations tied to the allegations surrounding Topuria’s absence.“Remember when I fought Ilia, he won, and then afterwards, he got a pair of overalls and was making fun of me, because I run a farm and I run around in overalls, and he thought that was hilarious? Well, I got something for you,” Mitchell said before continuing, “This is called the ‘Wife Beater Special.’That’s right. I got my wife beater on for Ilia Topuria. That b*tch puts his hands on a woman.”Mitchell framed his anger through personal history and values, adding, “I grew up without a dad, never seen my dad, never will see my dad. And you know what? I’d rather not see my dad than have my dad there beating on my mom.” He warned, “Let me tell you something, that’ll get you killed around these parts, son.”The rant continued with Mitchell blending condemnation and religion. “But anyways, bro, who am I to judge? I fall short of the glory of God, too,” he said. “Ilia, you need to repent, return to Jesus Christ… and probably stop drinking, too.”Topuria addressed the situation directly through a detailed public statement, explaining that domestic violence allegations from his ex-wife prompted his decision to step away from the octagon. “This was not a decision I took lightly,” he wrote. “However, when circumstances arise that threaten your personal integrity, your family, and your reputation, there comes a point when you must address them directly. ”He denied all claims and described what he called an extortion attempt. “In recent months, I have been subjected to severe and unacceptable pressure, including threats to disseminate false allegations of domestic abuse unless financial demands were met.” Topuria added, “These allegations are entirely unfounded. The truth is not a matter of opinion – it is a matter of evidence.”According to Topuria, evidence has already been submitted to judicial authorities, including recordings, written communications, witness statements, and video material. “My initial decision to remain silent was made solely to protect my children,” he explained, before concluding, “Out of respect for my children and the ongoing legal proceedings, I will not be making any further public statements.”With Topuria sidelined, the UFC plans to move forward with an interim lightweight title bout between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett at UFC 324 in Las Vegas. The champion’s return timeline remains uncertain.Also Read: Why Ilia Topuria is stepping away from the UFC and putting his title defense on hold?

In a key development in the Brown University shooting case, authorities have identified a 24-year-old man as a person of interest.Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, following an 11-hour manhunt, New York Post reported.He was sought in connection with a mass shooting at Brown University’s Providence campus during a final-exam study session on Saturday around 4.30 pm. Two students were killed and nine more wounded when the gunman opened fire.Police said Erickson was not a current student but investigators were examining whether he had studied at Brown or had other ties to the institution. He was being held as a person of interest; no charges had been filed.According to the records, Erickson served in the US Army.He served as an infantryman in the US Army from May 2021 to November 2024, leaving the military with the rank of specialist, an Army rep told The Post.His voter registration showing a “statehood” party affiliation, according to public records.Law-enforcement officials said the shooter was armed with a handgun and fired more than 40 9 mm rounds. CCTV footage showed a man matching his description walking along a road near the campus before the attack.Shell casings were marked with evidence tags inside the building where the shooting took place.Investigators were also probing whether Erickson had long-standing mental-health issues, sources said. “The man told authorities he had been in his room the entire time Saturday when the shooting took place,” CNN said.The motive remained unclear. Erickson did not immediately appear to have any criminal history, according to public records.A revolver and a small handgun fitted with a special laser light were found in his hotel room, sources and CNN reported. Sources told The Post that the unique laser light on the handgun helped lead them to the person of interest.The FBI’s Cellular Analysis Survey team geolocated Erickson to the Coventry hotel, according to agency director Kash Patel. Police also used video evidence, tips from the public, an examination of license-plate readers and other leads to track him, CNN said.The shooting occurred around 4.30 pm during a final exam review session for an economics class run by Rachel Friedberg, who also served as a faculty associate of the school’s Programme in Judaic Studies.One victim remained in critical condition, seven were listed as stable and one had been discharged, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters on Sunday morning.“We continue to be in mourning as a community about the tragic loss of life from gun violence that stole the lives of two of our students yesterday,” Brown University President Christina Paxson said in a statement. “The past 24 hours really have been unimaginable — it’s a tragedy that no university community is ever ready for. While we always prepare for major crises, we also pray such a day never comes” she added.A shelter-in-place order was lifted on the campus, although all final exams were cancelled. “At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now,” school Provost Francis J. Doyle III said in a message.US President Trump also mourned the victims, speaking at a White House Christmas event shortly before a mass shooting in Australia’s Bondi Beach. “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately, two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured, and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven,” Trump said.A candlelight vigil was held for the victims at Lippitt Memorial on Sunday instead of the town’s holiday light celebration, Providence Councilwoman Sue AnderBois said as hundreds gathered. “We are gathered here to share light with one another in one of Providence’s darkest times,” she said.“Our hearts break for the two students at Brown who lost their lives to gun violence yesterday, and the nine others who are injured, and their families and the whole Brown and Greater Providence community.","Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island.

A forced pivot to Canada

Innovation versus immigration politics

Living with permanent uncertainty









For nearly a year, Delaram Pouyabahar planned her next academic step around a postdoctoral position at Harvard University. Interviews, fellowship applications, visa paperwork and a consular interview in Toronto were all completed. Then, in early June 2025, a new US travel ban quietly brought those plans to a halt.The policy, announced on June 4, expanded the scope of the 2017 travel ban to 19 countries, including Iran. Unlike the earlier ban, which still allowed many students and academic researchers to enter the US after delays or special approvals, the new rules removed those pathways altogether. According to Pouyabahar’s own public account, her visa process simply stalled after the ban took effect, leaving her unable to take up the Harvard postdoc she had spent months preparing for.Pouyabahar is not an obscure or early stage applicant. She is an Iranian born computational biologist specialising in machine learning methods for single cell RNA sequencing, a fast growing area at the intersection of AI and life sciences. One of her Nature journal papers has been cited more than 200 times, an unusually high figure for an early career researcher and a marker of broad influence within the field.Her work focuses on developing tools that help scientists interpret complex biological data, methods that are now used by research groups worldwide.In a global academic system that prizes measurable impact, citation counts and journal quality, her profile places her among the most competitive candidates for elite postdoctoral positions.The 2025 travel ban goes further than its 2017 predecessor. While the earlier policy eventually allowed exemptions for F and J visas covering students, postdoctoral researchers and visiting scholars, the new version offers no such carve outs. New entries from affected countries are blocked regardless of academic credentials or institutional sponsorship.Higher education associations and university immigration offices estimate that thousands of prospective students and scholars, potentially more than 10,000, could be affected by the policy. At institutions such as Harvard, administrators have warned that dozens of incoming researchers from banned countries may be unable to take up their positions.When draft versions of the ban appeared in media reports in March 2025, Pouyabahar attempted to accelerate her timeline. She rescheduled her PhD defence at short notice, preparing in just two weeks in the hope that an earlier completion date might protect her plans.Those efforts proved futile. The ban was announced only weeks after her visa interview, and she has said she never received a response. When she asked about the possibility of an exemption, she was told it was unlikely to help under the new policy framework.With the US option closed, Pouyabahar redirected her career to Canada, where she was already based and where immigration pathways for researchers remain more predictable. The move allowed her to continue her work, but it came at the cost of abandoning a carefully planned transition to one of the world’s most prestigious research environments.Her experience reflects a broader pattern among Iranian scholars affected by the ban. Many have quietly rerouted their careers to Canada or Europe, while others have delayed projects, lost funding opportunities or put academic plans on hold altogether.Economists and science policy researchers have consistently shown that high skilled immigrants play an outsized role in US innovation. Foreign born scientists account for a disproportionate share of patents, startups and breakthrough research, particularly in fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence.Critics argue that policies which exclude researchers like Pouyabahar undermine America’s scientific and economic competitiveness. Supporters of the ban frame it as a national security measure. What stands out, however, is how muted the political and public response has been compared with the airport protests and legal battles that followed the 2017 travel ban.Beyond the immediate career impact, Pouyabahar has described the psychological toll of the process, pointing to months of uncertainty over visa status, the risk of frozen grants and the constant fear of sudden policy changes.Reflecting on the outcome, she has said that in the current political climate she feels a sense of reluctant relief at not entering a system where immigration status can be overturned overnight. For her and many others, the experience has reshaped how they view the US as a destination for building a scientific career.","Delaram Pouyabahar is an Iranian born computational biologist specialising in machine learning methods for single cell RNA sequencing.

Putin’s Friend Goes Nuclear At NATO Military Buildup On Border: ‘Balloons Fly To Lithuania Because…’





VILNIUS, LITHUANIA: Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko has pardoned 123 prisoners in exchange for a lifting of some U.S. sanctions, Belarusian state news agency Belta said Saturday, as the isolated nation seeks to improve relations with Washington.A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday.A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Speaking with journalists, Coale described the two-day talks as ""very productive,"" Belarus' state news agency Belta reported Saturday.The U.S. envoy said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was ""our goal.""""We're lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We're constantly talking to each other,"" he said, according to Belta. He also said that the relationship between the countries was moving from ""baby steps to more confident steps"" as they increased dialogue.The last time U.S. officials met with Lukashenko in September 2025, Washington announced easing some of the sanctions against Belarus while Mink released more than 50 political prisoners into Lithuania. Overall, Belarus released more than 430 political prisoners since July 2024, in what was widely seen as an effort at a rapprochement with the West.Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press on Saturday that sanctions relief was part of a deal between Minsk and Washington, in which another large group of political prisoners in Belarus were expected to be released.""The freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,"" Tsikhanouskaya said.She added: ""But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.""Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk that those imposed by the U.S, saying that while easing U.S. sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for longterm, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.The latest round discussions also touched on Venezuela, as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Belta said.Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given ""good advice"" on how to address the conflict, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were ""longtime friends"" with ""the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.""""Naturally, President Putin may accept some advice and not others,"" Coale said.","John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday. A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. The country has been repeatedly sanctioned for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125950210,imgsize-163798,width-400,resizemode-4/belarusian-leader-pardons-123-prisoners-in-exchange-for-lifting-of-some-sanctions.jpg"

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms.

Australia was rocked by one of its deadliest mass shootings in decades after a Pakistani-origin father and son opened fire at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 16, including gunman, during a Jewish festival.The shooting has been declared a ""terrorist incident"", with two Islamic State (IS) flags being recovered during subsequent raids, ABC news reported.Authorities identified the assailants as a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son. The father was shot dead by police at the scene, while the son was taken to hospital with critical injuries. Police said the father legally owned six firearms, believed to have been used in the attack.Australian PM Anthony Albanese has proposed ""tougher gun laws"" saying, ""The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.""The two suspected gunmen behind were identified as a father and his son, authorities said. The 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, was critically injured and remains hospitalised, CBS news cited New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon saying.Moreover, investigators believe that the duo had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group. Two IS flags were recovered from their car parked near Bondi Beach, with footage from the scene showing one flag placed on the vehicle’s bonnet, ABC news cited senior officials saying.Australia’s domestic intelligence agency ASIO had previously examined Naveed Akram about six years ago due to his close links with a Sydney-based IS terror cell. He was reportedly connected to Isaak El Matari, an IS operative arrested in 2019 and later jailed for plotting an insurgency in Australia. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess confirmed that one of the attackers was known to the agency, though not assessed as an immediate threat at the time.The shooting unfolded on a Sunday afternoon at Bondi Beach, where more than 1,000 people had gathered to celebrate Hanukkah. Armed with long-barrelled guns, the attackers indiscriminately targeted crowds at the popular tourist hotspot.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Australian government and accused it of ""pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism"" in the period leading up to the shooting.""Antisemitism is a cancer that spreads when leaders are silent and do not act,"" AFP quoted him saying.Armed with long-barrelled guns, the father-and-son attackers opened fire on the packed tourist hotspot, triggering scenes of panic as families and visitors ran for safety, leaving behind belongings scattered across the sand.As shots rang out, some people hid in nearby shops and buildings, while others sought cover behind beach facilities. Social media footage showed moments of bravery amid the terror, including a bystander who confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled a weapon away. Police quickly responded, shooting dead the older attacker at the scene, while his son was critically injured.By the time the area was secured, the beachfront was littered with discarded shoes, blankets and picnic items, stark reminders of the sudden violence that shattered a festive afternoon.Australian authorities declared the act a ""terrorist incident"", with PM Anthony Albanese condemning it as ""pure evil"".""What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations,"" AFP quoted Albanese saying.""It is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,"" he added.","Authorities identified the assailants as a father and his 24-year-old son.

"Merriam-Webster’s picks ‘slop’ as word of 2025, in vogue due to AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/merriam-websters-picks-slop-as-word-of-2025-in-vogue-due-to-ai/articleshow/125993955.cms,".





Washington: Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called “slop”. The word’s proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster’s 2025 word of the year. “It’s such an illustrative word,” said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster’s president ahead of Monday’s announcement. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.”“Slop” was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence”. In other words, “you know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,” Barlow said.AI video generators have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now — and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend US military actions in Venezuela.The Canadian animated show “Franklin” teaches about kindness, empathy and inclusivity — but in Hegseth’s hands, its main character became a tool to promote violence. The word “slop” evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew.To select the word of the year, the dictionary’s editors review data about which words have risen in searches and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year. “We like to think that we are a mirror for people,” Barlow said.","Merriam-Webster names'slop' as its word of the year for 2025.

Drug addiction to homeless: Meet Nick Reiner







What began as an awkward meltdown at a Hollywood Christmas party reportedly ended in one of the industry’s most horrifying family tragedies.Just hours after a volatile blow-up at Conan O’Brien’s holiday gathering, Rob Reiner’s troubled son Nick allegedly turned on the two people who had spent decades trying to save him. Friends say the famed director left the party shaken and fearful after Nick’s erratic behavior alarmed guests and reignited long-running fears about his spiraling mental health and relapse into drugs.By the next day, police say those fears had turned into a nightmare, with Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, found brutally slain inside their Los Angeles home.The police alleged that their son Nick Reiner, the 49-year-old, murdered his parents on Sunday at their Los Angeles mansion after a “very loud argument’’ at the party on Saturday, pals said. He is accused of fatally slitting their throats and stabbing them multiple times.The argument at the party reportedly erupted because Nick, who had at least 17 stints in rehab since age 15, was back on drugs and refused yet another course of treatment, sources told The Post. “Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous,’’ a source told People magazine. Friends said Rob and Michele left the gathering terrified of what their son might do next.A lifelong family friend who lives near the Reiner home told The Post, “They had had an argument at Conan’s holiday party, and Rob had been telling people that they’re scared for Nick and scared that his mental state was deteriorating.’’ The neighbour added, “Nick was supposedly off drugs,” but then talk surfaced that he was “not so much off them.” At his lowest point, he was “badly addicted to a combo of opiates and heroin,” the neighbour said.Another friend said, “I know [the parents] wanted him to get help, go to rehab, but he wanted to get help while at home — he did not want to get treatment at a facility. And I know they have argued about that for years.’’Nick’s sister, Romy, 28, a magazine writer and aspiring actress, discovered their parents’ bodies at around 3.40 pm on Sunday. She told investigators that her brother “should be a suspect’’ because he is “dangerous,’’ sources said. He was arrested hours later and charged with murder. He was held without bail and placed on suicide watch.Nick’s previous public outburst came months earlier at the Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica Canyon, where he screamed at his father in front of other diners.Rob and Michele also had a son, Jake, 34, who worked as a TV reporter in Houston and hosted a podcast on the LA Dodgers. Rob had previously been married to former sitcom star Penny Marshall and adopted her daughter, Tracy Marshall Reiner. Tracy, 61, told NBC News on Monday, “I came from the greatest family ever. I don’t know what to say. I’m in shock.”The last public appearance of the family came on Sept. 9, when Nick, Romy, Jake and their parents walked the red carpet at the Spinal Tap II: The End Continues premiere at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles.Nick had battled drug addiction for more than half his life, at times ending up broke and homeless. In 2015, he founded an environmental non-profit called Save Malibu, but it did not last a year.A cast member on his semi-autobiographical 2015 film Being Charlie, which Rob directed to help his son, said, “These poor people did everything to help this kid. [Nick’s] a nepo-baby, a spoiled kid to the tee.” Stunt performer Erik Audé told Page Six, “You could tell [Nick] was spoiled and Rob was just sick of his s–t. I just assumed, whether this is correct or not, this kid must be pushing all his buttons. Rob can’t do anything right. ”A family friend said, “This is not the first time their son has been violent. I know of another incident a few years back with Nick, but I won’t say more than that. I just never thought it would ever get to this point. It is such a nightmare.’’In 2018, Nick admitted on the Dopey podcast, “It’s not much of a story. I got totally spun out on uppers — I think it was coke and something else — and I was up for days on end. I started punching out some things in my guest house.”A former classmate of Nick’s told The Post, “instantly knew’’ he was the suspect when she heard the news. A security guard hired to patrol the Brentwood community told The Post that Nick had been living with his parents for at least a year. “You could tell something was a little off with him,’’ the guard, Trevor Taufahema, said. “He’s a strange individual, you know? I’m not sure who [the friend] was, but I’d always see [Nick] sneak off with him. I don’t know what they were doing.”The murders shocked the film-making community. Kathy Bates, who starred in Reiner’s 1990 film Misery, said, “I’m horrified hearing this terrible news. Absolutely devastated.” Fellow director Ron Howard tweeted, “He proved to be a superlative filmmaker, a supportive colleague and at all times a dedicated citizen.”","Nick Reiner, 49, is accused of murdering his parents, Rob and Michele, at their Los Angeles mansion on Sunday.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday at the White House in Washington, declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction, dramatically expanding the US government’s authority to fight the synthetic opioid blamed for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.The designation, unprecedented for a narcotic, signalled Trump’s intent to treat fentanyl not merely as a public health crisis but as a national security threat on a par with chemical warfare.The classification empowers the Pentagon to assist law enforcement and allows intelligence agencies to deploy against drug traffickers the tools normally reserved for countering weapons proliferation.""We're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,"" Trump said at a White House event honouring servicemembers tasked with helping to police the U.S. southern border with Mexico. ""They're trying to drug out our country.""""Illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic,"" Trump’s order said.Trump’s designation of drug cartels this year as foreign terrorist organisations opened the door to military action against them. Since early September, the Trump administration carried out more than 20 strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.Legal experts say the strikes may be illegal. There has been little or no proof made public that the boats were carrying drugs or that it was necessary to destroy them rather than stop them, seize their cargo and question those on board.A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Wednesday found that a broad swath of Americans oppose the U.S. military’s campaign of deadly strikes on the boats, including about one-fifth of Trump’s Republicans.Trump has repeatedly threatened strikes on land in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico to battle drug trafficking. In a sweeping strategy document published last week, Trump said his administration’s foreign policy focus would be on reasserting U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.Mexico is the largest source of U.S.-bound illicit fentanyl. Many of the chemicals used to manufacture the drug are sourced from China. The opioid is a leading cause of U.S. overdose deaths.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday at the White House in Washington, declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction.

Indian American political leaders have called for stronger gun safety measures following a deadly shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, that left two people dead and eight others injured. The attack took place on 14 December and prompted widespread condemnation and renewed debate over gun violence in the US.California Representative Ro Khanna described the incident as a “horrific mass shooting” and said repeated failures to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation continue to have deadly consequences. He added that Congress has debated gun reform for years without decisive action, despite broad public concern over mass shootings. Khanna said the Brown University attack once again shows the urgency of addressing gun violence at the federal level.Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal echoed those concerns, saying the frequency of mass shootings across the country should compel lawmakers to move beyond statements and towards concrete reforms. She said the US has seen too many such attacks in schools and public spaces, underscoring the scale of the problem.Jayapal added that legislative action is essential to reduce the risk of future violence and protect communities.Illinois Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi also expressed solidarity with the Brown University community, offering condolences to the victims and their families while urging Congress to take action to address gun violence. He said incidents like the Brown University shooting highlight the need for bipartisan efforts to reduce gun-related deaths and injuries. Krishnamoorthi added that protecting students and public spaces should remain a priority for lawmakers.The shooting occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack, adding to the significance of the moment for advocates of gun reform.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers. But let's take a look at how they're actually using these visas.""Schmitt first attacked Blue stronghold and Gavin Newsom's territory of California. He said that California's AG, Rob Bonta, accused the Trump administration of trying to ""shut out the skilled workers America depends on.""Schmitt said that California has been the site of some of the most ""egregious H-1B abuse.""He used the example of Southern California Edison: Hundreds of US tech workers were laid off and then forced to train their H-1B replacements just to receive their severance package.One laid-off American worker said: ""They told us they could replace one of us with three, four, or five Indian personnel and still save money. They said, we can get four Indian guys for cheaper than the price of you.""Eric then took aim at Democratic Tony Ever's Wisconsin. The Republican claimed that motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has been sued in federal court for partnering with Indian outsourcing firms to lay off Wisconsin IT workers and force them to train their H-1B replacements.Like other Blue strongholds, Eric said that multiple major companies in Connecticut have fired American tech workers in high numbers and forced them to train their H-1B replacements.Eric claimed that one laid-off American in Connecticut was forced to train 10 additional workers back in India via web conferencing.Schmitt said that Illinois is ""another plaintiff."" He claimed that Illinois' Democratic senator Dick Durbin has been pushing for H-1B reform for decades.The US workers who were fired in the state put American flags outside their cubicles in protest before they left.Eric said that New Jersey is ""home to Toys ""R"" Us, which brought in H-1B workers from India to shadow employees for weeks (even following them to the restroom) so the foreign workers could create manuals on how to do the jobs themselves. Then the Americans were laid off.""Eric said that Microsoft recently announced mass layoffs while applying for thousands of H-1B visas in the Blue stronghold.Schmitt claimed that Minnesota's largest employers have laid off hundreds of IT workers and outsourced them to India. He also accused Oregon's Attorney General of using H-1Bs to fill the position of ""intern"".Schmitt ended by saying: ""The H-1Bs were sold as a way to keep America 'globally competitive.'

US President Donald Trump announced Monday (local time) his plan to classify fentanyl as a ""weapon of mass destruction"" to strengthen his campaign against drug smuggling Trump made this announcement in the Oval Office while presenting medals to US troops who patrolled the US-Mexican border.""There's no doubt that America's adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans. If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars,"" Trump said.The president drew parallels between current fentanyl smuggling and historical events. Fentanyl has claimed nearly 330,000 American lives in the five-year period ending in April.""You can look throughout history. Look at China, when they were loaded up with drugs, they were suffering greatly, and others were able to take them over. And other countries also, they're trying to drug out our country,"" Trump said.The specific implications of the new classification were not immediately detailed, though it could lead to harsher criminal penalties for traffickers.Trump acknowledged that fentanyl, which can be lethal in small doses, has legitimate medical uses. The drug is commonly smuggled through the Mexican border or international mail and shipping systems.The announcement follows Trump's October meeting with Xi Jinping, who made commitments to combat fentanyl trafficking.

FBI foiled a suspected New Year's Eve terror plot in California, releasing surveillance footage of the extremists just before their arrest.Four alleged members of a far-left pro-Palestinian anti-government group called the Turtle Island Liberation Front were apprehended last week while travelling east of Los Angeles to test improvised explosive devices (IEDs), officials said.The group is suspected of planning coordinated bomb attacks at at least five locations across the region.US Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that authorities prevented ""far-left"" extremists from executing ""a massive and horrific terror plot"".The suspects were identified as: Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41.The quad face charges, including conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device, according to a complaint filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California.Officials said the group travelled to the desert with ""precursor chemicals"" on December 12, intending to build bombs. A surveillance plane captured their movements, and the FBI and Los Angeles SWAT team arrested the quartet without incident.The plot reportedly targeted two logistics centres at midnight on New Year's Eve. The group also allegedly discussed attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and vehicles in January or February.One of the extremists, Carroll, allegedly said: ""That would take some of them out and scare the rest of them.""LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell praised the coordinated effort. ""The successful disruption of this plot is a powerful testament to the strength of our unified response,"" he said, adding that collaboration with allied agencies ""prevented a potential tragedy and reaffirmed our shared commitment to safeguarding our communities"".The FBI has said the investigation is ongoing to identify any additional suspects connected to the plot.","Four alleged members of a far-left pro-Palestinian anti-government group were apprehended last week.

A 32-year-old Florida physician and mother of two was found dead inside a freezer at a Dollar Tree store in Miami, a day after she entered the shop, according to police and local media reports. The woman, identified as Helen Massiell Garay Sanchez, was discovered by a store employee on Sunday morning. Authorities have said her death is being treated as unexplained, with investigations continuing into how and why she entered the restricted area where her body was found.Miami Police said officers were called to the Dollar Tree store on Southwest 8th Street around 8 a.m. on Sunday after an employee reported finding an unresponsive woman inside a freezer located in an employees-only area. Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene. The store was closed for several hours while police conducted their investigation.According to investigators, Garay Sanchez entered the Dollar Tree on Saturday evening shortly before the store closed. Surveillance footage reviewed by police shows she did not make any purchases. Authorities say she then accessed a restricted area not open to customers, where the freezer was located, and remained there overnight.Her body was discovered the following morning when an employee opened the store.Police have said there is no evidence of foul play at this stage. Investigators stated that Garay Sanchez was not forced into the freezer and was not an employee of the store. Her death has been classified as unclassified pending further examination, and officials have not released a cause of death.Garay Sanchez was originally from Nicaragua and worked as a physician specialising in anaesthesiology, with a focus on congenital heart disease, according to a GoFundMe page organised by her family. She was described as a devoted doctor whose work helped children and families, as well as a loving mother to two young children who live in Nicaragua.Authorities are continuing to review surveillance footage, speak with witnesses and examine whether personal or mental health factors may have played a role, according to local reports. Miami Police said further details would be released once the investigation progresses.A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to help return Garay Sanchez’s body to Nicaragua for funeral services. As of Monday, several thousand dollars had been raised to support the family.","Helen Massiell Garay Sanchez, 32, was found dead inside a freezer at a Dollar Tree store in Miami on Sunday morning.

Minnesota Democratic leader Tim Walz criticised federal immigration enforcement after Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s son was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents while returning from a shopping trip, calling the encounter “racial profiling”.In a post on X, Walz said: “Congresswoman Omar’s son was pulled over by ICE while he was following the law, on his way home from Target. This isn’t a targeted operation to find violent criminals, it’s racial profiling.”Omar told Minneapolis broadcaster WCCO that her son, whom she did not name, was pulled over on Saturday after leaving a Target store. “Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [ICE] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,” she said. She added that he “always carries” his passport with him.Earlier the same day, ICE agents reportedly entered a mosque where her son had been praying but left without incident. Omar said she warned him to be careful because federal enforcement appears focused on areas with young Somali men. “They are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,” she said.The stop comes amid “Operation Metro Surge”, a federal effort targeting undocumented Somalis and Latinos in the Twin Cities area.Omar is the first Somali American in Congress. She criticised the operation as racial profiling and accused President Donald Trump of inciting hate against Somalis and herself. She said: “I had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in. ”Omar sent a letter to Homeland Security officials describing the enforcement as involving “blatant racial profiling, an egregious level of unnecessary force, and activity that appears designed for social media rather than befitting a law enforcement agency.”","Minnesota Democratic leader Tim Walz criticised federal immigration enforcement.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

US Clears $686 Million F-16 Upgrade For Pakistan, Sparking Major Strategic Ripples Across South Asia





The United States has approved a major arms deal worth $686 million to sell advanced technology and support for F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, Dawn reported citing a Defense Security Cooperation Agency letter to US Congress.The deal would “support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations,” the letter said.The package covers Link-16 systems, encryption gear, upgraded avionics, training, and full logistical support, the Pakistani news outlet reported.“It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter said.Additionally, it said that the deal would allow “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns.”The deal will also supply Pakistan with engineering, technical, and logistics assistance from both the US government and contractors, along with studies, surveys, and other supporting program and logistical services.This comes only weeks after a major defence boost for India, with the United States approving a potential $93 million arms sale intended to “strengthen homeland defense and deter regional threats.” The package includes the Javelin Missile System and associated equipment valued at $45.7 million, along with 216 M982A1 Excalibur tactical rounds priced at $47.1 million.""The State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to India of Javelin Missile System and related equipment for an estimated cost of $45.7 million.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"
Where is Aung San Suu Kyi? Son Kim Aris fears for her life amid detention; shares chilling health details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/where-is-aung-san-suu-kyi-son-kim-aris-fears-for-her-life-amid-detention-shares-chilling-health-details/articleshow/125988077.cms,"Aung San Suu Kyi (File photo) and Kim Aris (AP image)





Kim Aris, son of Myanmar’s detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi , fears he may not even learn if his mother has passed away due to her failing health. He has had no direct contact with her since the 2021 military coup.In an interview with Reuters, Aris said that he has not seen or heard from his 80-year-old mother in years and has only received sporadic, secondhand updates on her heart, bone and gum problems.""She's got ongoing health issues. Nobody has seen her in over two years. She hasn't been allowed contact with her legal team, never mind her family,"" he said. ""For all I know, she could be dead already.""Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges including incitement, corruption and election fraud, all of which she denies.Aris said he believes she is being held in the capital Naypyitaw and has last heard from her in a letter two years ago, in which she described the extreme summer and winter temperatures in her cell.Myanmar has remained in turmoil since the 2021 coup, triggering armed conflicts across the country. The military plans to hold elections later this month, a move widely criticised by foreign governments as an attempt to legitimise military rule.Aris said he is urging foreign governments, including Japan, to put more pressure on the junta and draw attention to his mother’s situation.""Because of the upcoming elections that the military are trying to stage, which we all know are completely unfair… I need to use this small window of opportunity,"" he said.While rejecting the credibility of the polls, Aris said the elections could still offer a narrow opening for his mother’s release or transfer to house arrest.Explaining his assessment of the junta’s intent, he said: ""I imagine (Myanmar junta leader) Min Aung Hlaing has his own agenda when it comes to my mother. If he does want to use her to try and appease the general population before or after the elections by either releasing her or moving her to house arrest, then at least that would be something,"" he added.Aris also reflected on the international perception of Suu Kyi, saying, ""In the past, when my mother was held in higher regard by the international community, then it was much harder for people to ignore what's happening in Burma. But since her position was undermined through the crisis in Rakhine, that's no longer the case.""Aris emphasized that he is advocating for this cause due to his family duty.""I think she'd be incredibly sad that I've had to do this. She's always wanted me to not have to get involved. But I don't really have a choice at the moment. I am her son after all. And if I'm not doing it, I can't expect anybody else to do it,"" he said.","Kim Aris fears he may not even learn if his mother has passed away due to her failing health.

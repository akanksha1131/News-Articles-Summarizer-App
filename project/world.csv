What is Silk Road?



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned the creator of the Silk Road dark web marketplace Ross William Ulbricht and called his sentence ""ridiculous.""Trump criticised the severity of Ulbricht's sentence and said that ""the scum"" that worked to convict him were some of the ""same lunatics"" who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against him.""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.""The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!"" he added.This clemency fulfils Trump's campaign pledge. During his address at the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington, DC, in May 2024, Trump committed to reducing Ulbricht's sentence upon taking office, reported CNN.""If you vote for me, on Day 1 I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,"" Trump said at the time. ""He's already served 11 years. We're going to get him home.""Ulbricht had been serving a life sentence for establishing what the Justice Department considered ""the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.""The Silk Road operation ended in October 2013 when the FBI arrested Ulbricht after he reportedly revealed his email address online. A court found him guilty in February 2015 of multiple offences including money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking.Ulbricht's arrest in 2013 ended the operations of what law enforcement officials identified as an unprecedented digital marketplace. This platform enabled approximately 4,000 drug vendors to transition from street-level trading to online operations, reaching over 100,000 customers across multiple nations, including Argentina, Australia, the United States and Ukraine, Guardian reported.During his three-year management of Silk Road, Ulbricht accumulated $18m in bitcoins through commission fees from the platform, which featured extensive product listings categorised under ""Cannabis"", ""Psychedelics"" and ""Stimulants"". Operating under the pseudonym ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" – a character from The Princess Bride – he facilitated drug transactions exceeding $183m in value. Law enforcement officials reported that several fatalities were linked to substances purchased through the Silk Road platform.The Silk Road platform evolved into the Internet's most advanced criminal marketplace, functioning as an extensive black-market exchange where users regularly traded illegal drugs and various unlawful goods and services. During its operational period, Silk Road facilitated thousands of drug dealers and illegal vendors in distributing vast quantities of drugs and other illicit items to over 100,000 customers, whilst enabling money laundering of hundreds of millions in illegal proceeds, US justice department said in a statement.Ulbricht intentionally ran Silk Road as a platform for anonymous illegal trade beyond law enforcement's reach. He implemented two primary anonymisation methods: operating on the ""Tor"" network, a specialised Internet infrastructure concealing users' IP addresses, and incorporating a Bitcoin payment system to obscure user identities and locations during transactions.As of September 23, 2013, Silk Road's homepage featured approximately 13,000 controlled substance listings under categories including ""Cannabis,"" ""Dissociatives,"" ""Ecstasy,"" ""Intoxicants,"" ""Opioids,"" ""Precursors,"" ""Prescription,"" ""Psychedelics,"" and ""Stimulants."" Between November 2011 and September 2013, law enforcement conducted over 60 undercover purchases of illegal substances from vendors across multiple countries, including the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, and France.Six documented overdose deaths worldwide have been connected to Silk Road's narcotics trade. These included Jordan M., a 27-year-old Microsoft employee found deceased at his computer whilst logged into Silk Road, and two 16-year-olds, Preston B. from Perth, Australia, and Alejandro N. from Camino, California, who died from synthetic LSD purchased on the platform. Additional casualties included Bryan B., aged 25, from Boston, Massachusetts, Scott W., aged 36, from Australia, and Jacob B., aged 22, from Australia.","US President Donald Trump pardoned the creator of the Silk Road dark web marketplace Ross William Ulbricht and called his sentence ""ridiculous"" Trump said that ""the scum"" that worked to convict him were some of the ""same lunatics"" who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against him.

"'They treat us very, very badly': Trump plans to hit European Union with tariffs, 10% rate on China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-treat-us-very-very-badly-trump-plans-to-hit-european-union-with-tariffs-10-rate-on-china/articleshow/117441495.cms,"‘You can't get fairness unless you do that’

European Union’s response

Tariff policies under Trump 2.0

US President Donald Trump has warned of slapping tariffs on the European Union with plans for a 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports, starting on 1 February.Speaking at the White House a day after he was sworn in as the President, Trump argued that the measures are necessary to address trade imbalances and combat fentanyl trafficking .""They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs,"" Trump accused the EU.""You can't get fairness unless you do that.""Earlier, Trump also targeted the EU for indulging in unfair trade practices alleging that the latter did not import enough American products, in response to which, he would be imposing duties or urge for increasing oil and gas purchases to ‘straighten that out.’Turning to China, Trump linked his tariff threat to the country’s alleged role in fentanyl trafficking, which he claimed was fuelling illegal activity in Mexico and Canada.“Probably February 1st is the date we’re looking at,” he stated when asked about the timeline for implementing the 10 per cent duty.Previously,during his campaign, Trump had threatened to impose tariffs of up to 60 per cent on the Asian giant.On Monday, he also talked about a telephonic conversation with Xi Jinping, “The call was a very good one for both China and the USA. It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects.”The US president once again brought up the tariff issue, on Tuesday, threatening to impose potential 25 per cent tariffs on major trade partners Canada and Mexico, alleging that the two nations failed to curb illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the US.EU economy commissioner Ursula von der Leyen expressed readiness to negotiate with Washington while highlighting that Europe would stand firm in protecting its interests.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, von der Leyen said, “We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values.”On Monday, Trump also signed an executive order directing US agencies to review trade practices, deficits, and currency manipulation, signalling a broader shake-up of the country’s trade policies.""Tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,"" he said.The investigations could pave the way for additional tariffs, further unsettling global markets.While Europe appears most concerned about Trump’s trade agenda, a survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations suggested countries like Brazil, India, and Turkey are optimistic about his potential impact on their economies and global peace.","US President Donald Trump has warned of slapping tariffs on the European Union with plans for a 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports, starting on 1 February.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he likes ""very competent people"" coming into the country and noted that he is not just talking about engineers, but also about people at all levels during a joint news conference at the White House.The US President expressed a balanced view on H-1B visa programme during a joint news conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman.""I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do. But I don't want to stop -- and I'm not just talking about engineers, I'm talking about people at all levels,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.A notable divide exists within Trump's support base regarding the H-1B visa system. Whilst Elon Musk of Tesla advocates for the programme as a means to recruit qualified tech professionals, other supporters contend it diminishes job opportunities for American workers.Trump highlighted his familiarity with the H-1B programme, citing his personal experience in utilising it for various positions including Maître d', wine specialists, and high-calibre waiters. He emphasised the technology sector's crucial need for engineers, specifically mentioning the requirements of business leaders like Larry and Masa.""We want competent people coming into our country. And H-1B, I know the programme very well. I use the programme. Maître d', wine experts, even waiters, high-quality waiters -- you've got to get the best people.

Pardons to January 6 rioters divides Republicans to defend Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pardons-to-january-6-rioters-divides-republicans-to-defend-donald-trump/articleshow/117441145.cms,"President Trump signs executive order pardoning about 1,500 defendants charged in Jan 6 attack on US Capitol (AP photo)

Republican senators struggled to defend President Donald Trump 's decision to commute and pardon hundreds of January 6 protesters, including those charged and convicted of crimes against police officers, just hours after he took office on Monday.The move put Republicans in the awkward position of having to either defy Trump or defend releasing prisoners who attacked the very officers who protect the Capitol.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, who previously warned against giving a blanket pardon to the rioters, said, ""I just can't agree"" with Trump's decision, adding that it ""raises a legitimate safety issues on Capitol Hill."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped questions about the pardons, saying, ""We're looking at the future, not the past,"" as reported by CNN.Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said he was still digesting the ""details"" of the pardons and commutations but emphasized that attacking a police officer is a ""very serious issue"" that should be punished. ""I think we need to continue to say we are a party of law and order,"" Lankford said.Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Bill Cassidy, R-La., Republicans who voted to convict Trump after his second impeachment trial in 2021, also objected to his decision. Murkowski expressed concern about the message the pardons send to the US Capitol Police officers who protect lawmakers every day, while Cassidy stated, ""I'm a big 'back-the-blue' guy. I think people who assault police officers — if they do the crime, they should do the time.""When asked Tuesday whether he believed it was never acceptable to assault a police officer, Trump replied, ""Sure."" Pressed on a specific case of an individual who drove a stun gun into the neck of a police officer but received a pardon, Trump said he didn't know but would ""take a look at everything."" He also claimed to be ""the friend of police more than any president that's ever been in this office.""Even Vice President JD Vance said few days before taking office that those who committed violence on January 6 ""obviously"" shouldn't be pardoned. When asked why Vance's assertion was wrong, Trump said, ""Well, only for one reason: They've served years in jail. They should not have served — excuse me — and they've served years in jail. … These were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate.""Most Republicans wouldn't weigh in on whether Trump had made the right decision, arguing that it was the president's prerogative, not Congress', to issue pardons. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., echoed this sentiment, with Johnson stating, ""It's not my place. It's the president's sole decision, and he made a decision so I stand with him on it.""When repeatedly asked about the pardons for individuals who attacked officers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., largely redirected the discussion to Biden's pardons, even as he agreed that January 6 was ""no question"" a ""riot."" He said, ""I have my personal feelings on it, but the American people have chosen to move on, and President Trump, it's his prerogative to do this. … I get what you're saying about the violent crime; however, that is still the president's prerogative, just like it was Joe Biden's prerogative.""Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., would only say, ""I'm grateful President Trump is the president of the United States"" when asked for his reaction to the pardons.The controversy is centred around US President Trump granting clemency to over 1,500 participants of the January 6 Capitol incident, encompassing leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations on his Day 1 in office. The presidential pardons cover individuals found guilty of grave offences, notwithstanding resistance and documented proof of aggressive encounters.The extended siege, lasting seven hours, caused injuries to more than 140 law enforcement personnel and resulted in the loss of life for four Trump supporters and five police officers, through both immediate and subsequent circumstances. The ensuing probe by the FBI and Justice Department evolved into the most extensive criminal investigation ever conducted in US history, with charges filed against more than 1,580 persons and successfully securing roughly 1,270 guilty verdicts.","Republican senators struggled to defend President Donald Trump's decision to commute and pardon hundreds of January 6 protesters, including those charged and convicted of crimes against police officers.

Musk machinations: How the billionaire helped boot Vivek Ramaswamy from DOGE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-machinations-how-the-billionaire-helped-boot-vivek-ramaswamy-from-doge/articleshow/117432493.cms,"Ramaswamy, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2024, has signaled plans to run for governor of Ohio. (AI image for representation only)

Driving the news

Barely two months after its inception, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a pet project of President Trump, is seeing a high-profile shakeup. Vivek Ramaswamy , the biotech entrepreneur turned Republican politician, has been forced out as co-chair of the advisory group.

), a pet project of President Trump, is seeing a high-profile shakeup. , the biotech entrepreneur turned Republican politician, has been forced out as co-chair of the advisory group. According to a Politico report, Ramaswamy's departure wasn’t entirely voluntary and reflects the outsized influence of his former partner at the helm: Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The advisory group, tasked with cutting federal bureaucracy and modernizing government operations, was announced by Trump as a centerpiece of his promise to streamline Washington.

Poll Where Would You Like Elon Musk to Contribute More? Politics Tech and Business

The power behind the throne

While Trump himself is the public face of the initiative, insiders describe Musk as the real force behind DOGE’s operations—and its controversies. Musk’s preference for bold, sweeping reforms has already clashed with Washington’s status quo. And when it came to Ramaswamy, Musk made it clear he no longer believed the biotech executive fit into the group’s plans, the Politico report said.

According to three sources familiar with Musk’s thinking, the tech mogul had grown increasingly frustrated with Ramaswamy’s attempts to balance his role at DOGE with a budding gubernatorial campaign in Ohio. Musk reportedly viewed the dual focus as untenable, with one source describing Musk’s sentiment as: “You can’t have one foot in DOGE and the other in politics.”

“Musk has an iron grip on DOGE,” a Republican strategist close to Trump’s team told Politico. “And when he decided Ramaswamy wasn’t a fit, it was only a matter of time.”

The fallout illustrates Musk's expanding influence in Trump’s orbit as the tech mogul takes a leading role in shaping the agenda of DOGE.

Ramaswamy’s departure also highlights tensions within Trump’s team, echoing the power struggles and infighting that characterized the former president’s first term.

Musk's influence has already raised concerns among critics, including former President Joe Biden, who warned of a “burgeoning oligarchy of tech billionaires” in Trump’s administration.

The big picture

DOGE is Trump’s latest attempt to bring private-sector efficiency to government, an idea that has historically faced skepticism and resistance. The advisory group is tasked with ambitious goals: cutting three-quarters of federal government jobs, eliminating entire agencies, and modernizing federal technology. Musk has championed the initiative’s lofty $2 trillion cost-cutting target, though he recently tempered expectations, admitting that even $1 trillion might be a challenge.

Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur-turned-politician, was expected to bring his expertise and conservative vision to DOGE. However, his blunt communication style and polarizing views quickly alienated key members of Trump’s circle. His December post on X (formerly Twitter), criticizing the US for “venerating mediocrity over excellence” and attributing tech companies’ preference for foreign H-1B visa holders to cultural failings, drew sharp backlash.

“They wanted him out before the tweet—but kicked him to the curb when that came out,” said a source to Politico.

The tweet compounded pre-existing frustrations within Trump’s team, with one Republican strategist summarizing, “Ramaswamy just burned through the bridges, and he finally burned Elon.”

Zoom in

What they are saying

A Trump spokesperson, Anna Kelly, praised Ramaswamy’s contributions, saying he “played a critical role in helping us create DOGE” and attributed his exit to his gubernatorial ambitions.

Ramaswamy, for his part, struck a conciliatory tone, posting a photo of himself shaking hands with Musk and captioning it “A new dawn.” Sources close to him claim the two men are now on good terms.

A Republican insider familiar with Musk’s thinking noted that the tech titan believed Ramaswamy’s gubernatorial campaign would distract from DOGE’s work.

Privately, however, the reactions have been less diplomatic. A cheeky meme circulating among Republican staffers depicted Musk as Josef Stalin and Ramaswamy as a Soviet official erased from history—a nod to Musk’s growing dominance in DOGE.

Even Ramaswamy’s allies admit the timing of his departure is awkward. As one source put it, “He wanted to notch some early wins at DOGE before announcing his gubernatorial bid. Now, it looks like he’s been pushed out, even if that’s not the full story.”

Between the lines

What’s next

Ramaswamy’s departure leaves Musk with near-total control of DOGE, a development that both excites his allies and alarms his critics. While Trump continues to tout the group as a cornerstone of his second-term agenda, DOGE’s ambitious goals have already encountered significant legal and logistical challenges.

The lawsuits against DOGE are mounting, with unions, watchdog groups, and public interest organizations questioning the group’s authority and transparency. Critics argue that the initiative is more about consolidating power than delivering results, pointing to similar advisory committees in past administrations that promised bold reforms but failed to deliver.

Still, Musk remains undeterred. During a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration, the billionaire couldn’t contain his enthusiasm, declaring, “Man, I can’t wait. This is going to be fantastic.”

Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is now pivoting to a new challenge: running for governor of Ohio. For Ramaswamy, the move marks a calculated shift toward political aspirations, but the way his exit unfolded—a mix of personal missteps and strategic sidelining by Musk—adds an air of controversy to his departure.

Ramaswamy’s gubernatorial campaign will likely focus on leveraging his business credentials and conservative bona fides, but his sudden exit from DOGE could become a liability. Democrats in Ohio have already begun framing him as a political opportunist, and his critics within the Republican Party may seize on the controversy to question his judgment.

The broader implications for Trump’s administration are equally significant. DOGE’s struggles could foreshadow the kind of dysfunction that plagued Trump’s first term, while Musk’s outsize role may further polarize public opinion.

As one Republican strategist put it, “If DOGE fails, it won’t be because of the lawsuits. It’ll be because no one could figure out how to work together.”

Elon Musk ’s growing influence in US President Donald Trump ’s second-term administration is already shaking things up—and creating casualties.Musk’s growing influence in Trump’s orbit has been on full display in recent weeks. As the co-leader of DOGE, Musk now enjoys unparalleled access to the administration. As per a New York Times report, Musk has a White House email address and is expected to receive office space in the West Wing.The Tesla CEO's proximity to power has raised eyebrows, particularly given his controversial reputation and history of clashes with government officials. Critics argue that Musk’s influence could lead to policies favoring tech billionaires while sidelining public accountability.“Less than a day into Trump’s second term, and we’re already seeing the rise of a tech oligarchy,” said a former Biden administration official.The tension between Musk’s vision for government and traditional Republican values has already surfaced. For instance, Musk’s support for immigration visas that bring skilled foreign workers to the US has put him at odds with figures like Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who criticized Musk for undermining the “America First” agenda.Ramaswamy’s departure underscores broader challenges facing DOGE. While the group’s goals have been touted as transformative, its structure as a non-department with no formal authority raises questions about its ability to implement change.Lawsuits from watchdog groups, unions, and public interest organizations have already been filed, alleging that DOGE violates federal advisory committee laws. Critics point to the group’s lack of transparency and accountability, warning that its grandiose plans may amount to little more than political theater.Advisory committees like DOGE often struggle to deliver on their promises. For example, a similar effort under President Ronald Reagan delivered its report 18 months late, and most of its recommendations were never implemented.(With inputs from agencies)","Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur turned Republican politician, has been forced out as co-chair of the DOGE advisory group.

Trump Inauguration: Why Melania Trump had her face hidden by a hat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-inauguration-why-melania-trump-had-her-face-hidden-by-a-hat/articleshow/117427701.cms,"First lady Melania Trump stands for a benediction during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.

Melania's hat stops Donald Trump kissing her at inauguration ceremony

The millinery, more than any other element of Melania Trump ’s inauguration ensemble, captured attention and sparked conversation. The wide-brim navy hat obscured much of her face, giving her an aura of inaccessibility and mystery. As Professor Nichola Gutgold, author of Electing Madam Vice President: When Women Run, Women Win, remarked in an email to CNN, “(With) her face half hidden by her hat, Melania remains aloof.” This air of detachment, coupled with the ensemble’s structured elements, conveyed a subtle defensiveness and a slight combative edge—an aesthetic that has become emblematic of Trump’s style evolution.During her first term as first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style. Initially soft and nostalgic—recall her Jackie Kennedy-inspired baby-blue Ralph Lauren ensemble at her first inauguration—her wardrobe evolved into one characterized by structured silhouettes and military-inspired detailing. Khaki dresses, sharply tailored navy suits, and outfits in muted grays became staples. These choices featured cinched waists, hard shoulders, and longer hemlines, evoking an image of restraint, power, and control.This shift was no accident. According to Kate Bennett, a former CNN White House correspondent and author of Free, Melania: The Unauthorized Biography, Trump’s clothing choices mirrored her guarded public persona . “Her silhouettes became long-sleeved, cinched waists, hard shoulders, longer hemlines, like almost a military-esque vibe,” Bennett noted. “I think that’s because it felt like armor … because she underwent four years of really intense scrutiny.”The scrutiny was indeed unparalleled. As the spouse of one of the most polarizing political figures in modern history, Melania Trump often found herself the subject of public and media examination, her every word, action, and outfit dissected. Unlike past first ladies who leaned into relatability or accessibility to counteract such pressures, Trump seemed to respond by retreating further into a private cocoon, using fashion as a literal and metaphorical barrier.Her hat at the 2025 inauguration epitomized this strategy. It recalled the other iconic broad-brimmed hat she wore during the state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018—a piece that also conveyed control and authority while maintaining an air of elegance. The choice of such millinery, both then and now, underscores her preference for styles that create boundaries between herself and the public.This intentional use of fashion as a form of armor aligns with the broader themes of her public life: elusive, impenetrable, and unwaveringly private. While her outfits may adhere to the highest standards of craftsmanship, they resist offering any real insight into her thoughts or emotions. Instead, they reinforce the idea that Melania Trump is a figure meant to be observed, not fully known—a paradoxical blend of visibility and concealment.By the time of her husband’s second inauguration, her style had cemented itself as a deliberate form of self-presentation. Each tailored coat, each structured dress, and each sweeping hat spoke volumes—not about who she is, but about the image she wished to project. Detached yet formidable, she continues to redefine the role of first lady, using sartorial choices to navigate public life on her own terms.","During her first term as first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style.

Watch: Trump pardons roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters

President Donald Trump addressed his decision to pardon and commute sentences of approximately 1,500 defendants linked to the January 6 Capitol incident in 2021, including those convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers.As one of his initial presidential actions, he commuted 14 prisoners' sentences and pardoned all others convicted of offences related to the 2021 riot, by signing an executive order. He also instructed the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments connected to this extensive federal investigation.""They've served years in jail,"" Trump said in response to questions from reporters at the White House about why he pardoned violent offenders. ""They should not have served, and they've served years in jail. And murderers don't even go to jail in this country.""""We pardoned people that were treated unbelievably poorly,"" he added.The pardons encompassed individuals convicted of violent attacks against police officers during the January 6, 2021 Capitol incident, when Congress was certifying Joe Biden 's electoral victory. These pardons extended to people who possessed weapons such as stun guns, batons and hatchets.Regarding the Oath Keepers, a far-right organisation, the President described their sentences as ""ridiculous and excessive"" and stated, ""these were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate."" Several Oath Keepers faced seditious conspiracy convictions related to January 6.The President also addressed various policy matters, including potential Russian sanctions, proposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, and immigration policies.

Elon Musk to buy TikTok? What President Donald Trump after 75-days ban delay order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-to-buy-tiktok-what-president-donald-trump-said-to-save-app-in-us/articleshow/117440892.cms,"Donald Trump open to idea of Musk buying TikTok

What does TikTok's future look like under Trump administration?

US President Donald Trump has expressed openness to tech billionaire Elon Musk , owner of social media platform X , acquiring the Chinese-owned app TikTok.Trump's comments come amidst ongoing legal challenges faced by TikTok in the United States, with a law mandating the company's divestment from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a nationwide ban.When asked about possibility of Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, buying the popular social media platform Trump told reporters, ""I would be if he wanted to buy it,"" as quoted by AFP.In one of his first acts upon returning to office, Trump ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing the law that would have effectively made TikTok illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before his second term began. The executive order directed the attorney general to delay the implementation of the law.Trump also suggested a potential 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and ByteDance as a way to save TikTok's US operations, although he did not provide specifics on how this arrangement could be achieved.The TikTok ban was enacted due to concerns over the Chinese government's potential exploitation of the app for espionage or covert influence on US public opinion through data collection and content manipulation.When asked if his phone had TikTok installed, which is banned on US government devices, Trump responded, ""No, but... I think I'll get it right now.""TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of users unable to access the app. However, with the tacit cooperation of its server provider, Oracle , TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday, crediting Trump's commitment to saving the app for making the reversal possible.Despite the restoration of service, Apple and Google have not yet made the app available in their app stores, preventing new users from downloading TikTok and existing users from receiving updates. Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to $5,000 per user if the app is accessed.Musk has been openly opposed to TikTok ban claiming it goes against freedom of speech . ""I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change,"" Musk had said on Sunday, soon after TikTok was back online after a brief shutdown.Last week, a report suggesting that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok.","US President Donald Trump has expressed openness to tech billionaire Elon Musk acquiring the Chinese-owned app TikTok.

Trump's Savage 'Eyeroll' After 'Woke' LGBTQ+ Plea By Washington Cathedral Bishop | Watch

Donald Trump SLAMS sermon, after Bishop pleads for immigrants, transgender rights

During President Donald Trump 's inaugural prayer service on Tuesday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde , leader of the Episcopal diocese of Washington , made a direct plea to the president to ""have mercy"" on gay, lesbian, transgender children, as well as immigrants in the country. This appeal came just a day after Trump issued several executive orders focused on transgender rights and immigration.""I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,"" Budde said. ""There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives.""Budde also addressed Trump's promise to enact mass deportations and turn away refugees and asylum-seekers, saying, ""I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here.""Trump, seated in the front pew, occasionally looked down, while Vice President JD Vance glanced at his wife before seemingly raising his eyebrows in surprise.Meanwhile, when asked by a reporter later what he thought of the service, Trump responded, ""Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting was it? I didn't think it was a good service, no. They could do much better.""The direct appeal to Trump at the start of his first full day as president was a remarkable moment at an event that has not historically been political, according to many. They saw Budde's candid sermon as a sign of the alarm in Washington and beyond over his immigration agenda and blitz of executive actions focused on gender identity. Budde was flooded with messages of support from people hailing her ""courage"". ""Wow. A bishop just called out Trump and Vance to their faces at church,"" said a podcast cast host on X. A man with Democrat in his also praised the bishop and said, ""HAHAHA! Trump is FURIOUS after being called out by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde,"" adding, "" Trump’s fragile ego has been badly damaged!""Meanwhile, Rep Mike Collins was irked by the sermon and said, ""The person giving this sermon should be added to the deportation list."" Other people also jumped on social media to oppose the bishop's action. ""The bishop embarrassed herself and it made Trump look like a leader,"" said an attorney and radio broadcaster according to his X profile.In an interview, Budde explained that she decided to speak to him directly because ""of the fear that I have seen and experienced among our people -- people that I know and love, both within the immigrant community and within the LGBTQ community, and how terrified so many are.""Bishop Budde, aged 65, holds the distinction of being the first female spiritual leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, a position she has maintained since 2011.Prior to her Washington appointment, she served as rector at St. John's Episcopal Church in Minneapolis for close to twenty years. She completed her education at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, and spent her formative years between New Jersey and Colorado. The diocese under her leadership, encompassing the National Cathedral, had arranged for a prayer service to be held the day following the inauguration, irrespective of the election results. She confirmed her commitment to deliver the sermon, regardless of who emerged victorious.","Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde urged President Trump to show compassion towards gay, lesbian, transgender children, and immigrants.

Attorneys general from 18 Democratic-led states sued President Trump on Tuesday to block an executive order that refuses to recognise the US-born children of unauthorised immigrants as citizens, the opening salvo in what promises to be a long legal battle over the Trump administration’s immigration policies.The complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts was joined by the cities of San Francisco and Washington, DC. The states view Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship as “extraordinary and extreme,” said New Jersey attorney general Matthew Platkin, who led the legal effort along with the attorneys general from California and Massachusetts. “Presidents are powerful, but he is not a king. He cannot rewrite the constitution with a stroke of the pen.”The lawsuit followed a pair of similar cases filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, immigrant organisations and an expectant mother in the hours after Trump signed the executive order.The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.","Attorneys general from 18 Democratic-led states sued President Trump on Tuesday to block an executive order that refuses to recognise the US-born children of unauthorised immigrants as citizens.

Danielle Hegseth (Dietrich) who was married to Pete's brother alleged that Pete Hegseth made his second wife ""fear for her safety"" during their marriage between 2010 and 2010.The second wife in question is Samantha Deering who refuted the allegations.Samantha said there was no physical abuse in her marriage.“There was no physical abuse in my marriage,” she said, according to NBC. “This is the only further statement I will make to you, I have let you know that I am not speaking and will not speak on my marriage to Pete. Please respect this decision.”Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Pete Hegseth, also rejected the allegations.“Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse, she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview.

Donald Trump had to fight both of them as Joe Biden was initially the presidential candidate until he was forced t0 bow out in favor of Kamala Harris.

She took a deep breath and looked tense.Body language expert Blanca Cobb noted that during Donald Trump's inauguration speech, Biden and Harris did not clap.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Inauguration ceremony

Economic and strategic significance

Challenges in Balochistan

Future prospects

Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province , officially became operational on Monday, marking a significant milestone in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.The inaugural ceremony at Gwadar International Airport witnessed the arrival of a Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi. Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.

A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively. Failure to pay the fines would result in additional six months jail time for Khan and three months for his wife.","Imran Khan condemned court's verdict in Al-Qadir Trust case, vows to 'fight till last ball' Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online.

In June 2020, the airline was banned from flying to the European Union, UK, and US after one of its Airbus A-320 planes crashed in Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was blamed on human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and it was later revealed that a significant number of pilots had dubious or fake licences.In 2016, a PIA plane caught fire after one of its engines failed during a flight from the remote north to Islamabad, killing over 40 people.In November, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted the ban on PIA, citing “sufficient confidence” in the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s oversight. However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback.

PM Sharif hopes to create 'lasting opportunities'

Pakistan has agreed to an unprecedented ten-year plan with the World Bank which will see $20 billion (€19.4 billion) worth of loans for the country's cash-strapped economy.The South Asian nation has been teetering on the brink of economic crisis for several years and is currently subject to a $7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout program.Political instability and catastrophic flooding in 2022, which temporarily submerged up to a third of the country, put the struggling economy under additional strain.Now it is hoped that the new "" Country Partnership Framework "" (CPF) announced with the World Bank overnight will see increased investment in private-sector growth and climate resilience from 2026 onwards.""We are focused on prioritizing investment and advisory interventions that will help crowd-in much needed private investment in sectors critical for Pakistan's sustainable growth and job creation,"" said Zeeshan Sheikh, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation Country Manager for Pakistan in a statement.He added that particular areas of focus include ""energy and water, agriculture, access to finance, manufacturing and digital infrastructure.""Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the plan, which he said was the first of its kind, in a post on social media, saying:""[The] CPF reflects the World Bank's confidence in Pakistan's economic resilience and potential.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's leftist government asked former presidents, including the once-powerful Rajapaksa brothers, on Tuesday to immediately vacate luxury government bungalows as part of a new austerity drive.The government has decided to convert the stately homes into upmarket boutique hotels or museums, Information Minister Nalinda Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.He said the state would pay former leaders rent totaling $107 a month, as they are entitled to under a 1986 law, instead of providing government housing.Jayatissa noted that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was occupying a government house with a monthly rental value of $16,500 (4.6 million rupees), which is more than 150 times his official entitlement.""The government will not provide housing for ex-presidents or their widows in future,"" Jayatissa said.""They will only receive a rent allowance equivalent to one-third of their pension, which is 30,000 rupees.""There was no immediate comment from Mahinda Rajapaksa, but a local media report said he was willing to vacate if given written notice.Jayatissa said the former leader could take Tuesday's public statement as his notice and vacate the premises immediately.Media reports said Rajapaksa, as prime minister in 2021, had spent some 800 million rupees of government money refurbishing the house he currently occupies as a former president.His younger brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to step down from the presidency in July 2022 over allegations of economic mismanagement and corruption, is also occupying a state mansion.Two other former presidents, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena, are living in government housing in Colombo's fashionable diplomatic quarters.Many of the houses were built during British colonial rule for top civil servants from London.Current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.The new government drastically reduced the number of security personnel assigned to former leaders last month, a move that authorities said saved more than 1,200 million rupees ($4.3 million) annually for taxpayers.The security of the two Rajapaksa brothers cost the state more than 1,017 million rupees ($3.63 million) last year, the government said.They ruled Sri Lanka for a decade until 2015 and again from November 2019 to July 2022.Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to step down in 2022 as Sri Lanka faced its worst economic meltdown, with foreign reserves plummeting and the nation running out of dollars to finance imports of essentials such as food, fuel and medicines.The number of bodyguards allocated to all former leaders has been reduced to a maximum of 60 since late December.","Sri Lanka's leftist government has asked former presidents to vacate luxury bungalows.

ISLAMABAD: The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions to investigate the events of May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024. Formal talks between the two sides commenced on December 23 of last year, aiming to ease the ongoing political tension and instability caused by PTI's protests against alleged electoral rigging and the arrests of its members and leaders.PTI presented its charter of demands during the third round of talks held on Jan 16, giving the government a seven-day timeline to set up two judicial commissions to probe the incidents of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024.The key demand has become a sticking point, as the government has yet to agree to form the commissions. In response, PTI's incarcerated leader Imran Khan has instructed his party to withdraw from the talks if the demand is not fulfilled.PTI chief Gohar Ali Khan told the media on Monday outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail that Khan had directed the negotiating team to withdraw from talks if the judicial commission was not formed within seven days.Khan, 72, has been lodged at the Adiala Jail since mid-2023 in multiple cases.Emphasising that the establishment of the judicial commission was critical for a meaningful dialogue, Gohar said if the government did not move forward on forming the commissions, there was no point in continuing the negotiations.Gohar said there wouldn't be a fourth round of talks if the commissions were not constituted. However, he added that the PTI team would wait for seven days for a response from the government side.On May 9, 2023, violent protests erupted after the arrest of Khan by paramilitary Rangers from the premises of the Islamabad high court. His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), and the ISI building in Faisalabad. Khan had said he was implicated in the May 9 cases as a result of a ""well-orchestrated plan"" to ""harass"" him for political reasons.On November 13 last year, Khan issued a ""final call"" for nationwide protests on November 26, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th constitutional amendment. Responding to his call, thousands of PTI workers reached Islamabad but faced a crackdown by police, which forcibly dispersed them while arresting more than 1,400.Meanwhile, the government's negotiation committee was mulling over extending its seven-day deadline by another week to submit its response to the PTI demands, said senator Irfan Siddiqui , the spokesperson for the government's negotiation committee.""Currently, the seven parties, included in the government committee, are in the process of mutual consultation and seeking guidance from their respective leaderships,"" Senator Siddiqui posted on X on Monday, adding that ""it may take another week to prepare the final response"".His statement came against the backdrop of several reports that claimed that the government side's response was ready and it had decided not to constitute a judicial commission on the May 9 incident.Siddiqui refuted the reports, terming them ""baseless"" and asserting that there was no truth in the news.PTI has earlier announced to conclude the talks by January 31, however, the deadline is unlikely to be met due to the current differences over the core demands.","The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions.

Taliban say 2 Americans held in Afghanistan were freed in a prisoner exchange,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-say-2-americans-held-in-afghanistan-were-freed-in-a-prisoner-exchange/articleshow/117427894.cms,"This family photo shows Ryan Corbett holding rabbits with his daughter Miriam and son Caleb in Kabul, Afghanistan in 2020. (Credits: AP)

ISLAMABAD: A prisoner swap between the United States and Afghanistan's Taliban freed two Americans in exchange for a Taliban figure imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials said Tuesday.The deal came as Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, handed power over to returning President Donald Trump. The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the ""normalization"" of ties between the US and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize their rule.The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008.The family of Ryan Corbett, one American held by the Taliban, confirmed he had been released in a statement. Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the US-backed government, was detained by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.""Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,"" the family's statement said. They thanked both Trump and Biden, as well as many government officials, for their efforts in freeing him.Corbett's family also praised the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar ""for their vital role in facilitating Ryan's release, and for their visits to Ryan as the United States' protecting power in Afghanistan."" Energy-rich Qatar, which hosted negotiations between the US and the Taliban over the years, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Both CNN and The New York Times, relying on anonymous US officials, identified the second American released as William McKenty, though no other details have emerged about his identity or what he was doing in Afghanistan.Mohammed, 55, was a prisoner in California after his 2008 conviction. The bureau of prisons early Tuesday listed Mohammed as not being in their custody.Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal, deputy spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said Mohammed had arrived in Afghanistan and was with his family. There were no immediate plans to celebrate or mark his freedom, Takal added.Mohammed was detained on the battlefield in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province and later taken to the US. A federal jury convicted him on charges of securing heroin and opium that he knew were bound for the United States and, in doing so, assisting terrorism activity.The Justice Department at the time referred to Mohammed as ""a violent jihadist and narcotics trafficker"" who ""sought to kill US soldiers in Afghanistan using rockets."" He was the first person to be convicted on US narco-terrorism laws.Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban have denied they have Habibi.Habibi's family welcomed the exchange and said they were confident the Trump administration would make a ""greater effort"" to free him, expressing their frustration with the Biden team.""We know they have evidence my brother is alive and in Taliban hands and it could have been influential in encouraging the Taliban to admit they have him,"" Habibi's brother Ahmed said in a statement shared by the nonprofit Global Reach. ""The Biden NSC (National Security Council) refused to use it. We know Trump is about results and we have faith he will use every tool available to get Mahmood home.""Officials in Washington did not respond to requests for comment early Tuesday after Trump's inauguration the day before.The Taliban called the exchange the result of ""long and fruitful negotiations"" with the US and said it was a good example of solving problems through dialogue.""The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalization and development of relations between the two countries,"" it said.The Taliban have been trying to make inroads in being recognized, in part to escape the economic tailspin caused by their takeover. Billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.","The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed.

Deporting Uyghurs against international law



No safety in Southeast Asia



Police say Lim Kimya's killing not political



Close ties between Bangkok and Phnom Penh alarm activists



Will Thailand become safer by joining UNHRC?



The recent fatal shooting of a Cambodian dissident in Thailand, combined with possible deportations of Uyghur refugees has once again shone a spotlight on Bangkok's failure to protect dissidents and political refugees.Former Cambodian lawmaker Lim Kimya was gunned down on January 7 in Thailand's capital. He had only arrived in Bangkok earlier that day on a bus from Cambodia.Separately, there are reports of the Thai government preparing to send 48 Uyghurs who have been detained in Bangkok for over a decade back to China.""Both Lim Kimya's killing and the current predicament of the Uyghurs show that (...) Thailand is not a safe place for refugees,"" Patrick Phongsathorn, a senior advocacy specialist for Fortify Rights, told DW.The assassination of Lim Kimya and the alleged deportations are only the latest in the long line of violent or legally questionable incidents concerning migrants in Thailand.In November 2024, Thai authorities forcibly returned six opposition activists to Cambodia to face treason charges, despite them having a UN-recognized refugee status.In mid-2024, Bangkok also arrested Y Quynh Bdap, a Vietnamese ethnic minority rights activist, following an extradition request from Hanoi.A year earlier, Bounsuan Kitiyano, an exiled Lao political activist who also had UN refugee status, was killed in Thailand's northeastern Ubon Ratchathani province.Thai authorities have also deported Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group in China's northwestern province of Xinjiang that has faced persecution by Beijing. In 2015, Thailand repatriated 109 Uyghur detainees to China — a decision that was widely condemned.The latest reports focus on the alleged deportation of 48 more people who had remained in Thailand's prisons.Phongsathorn says sending the group back to China would be illegal.""The government would not only be breaking international law but also its own anti-torture legislation, which protects individuals from being deported to places where they face torture or persecution,"" Phongsathorn said.Other countries in the region seem to follow the same trend. In an email to DW, Amnesty International said it has also ""observed the alarming escalation of transnational repression"" in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.""Activists, human rights defenders, and political dissidents who fled their home countries in hopes of a safe haven ended up facing abductions, enforced disappearance, killings, and forcible returns to places where they could face human rights violations,"" said Chanatip Tatiyakaroonwong, Amnesty International's Thailand and Laos researcher.For example, Thai human rights activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit disappeared in Cambodia in 2020. A year earlier, three Thai activists, Chucheep Chiwasut, Siam Theerawut, and Kritsana Tupthai, went missing after reportedly being arrested in Vietnam. Their whereabouts remain unknown.In late 2018, the bodies of two anti-royalist Thai activists, Chatcharn Buppawan and Kraidej Luelert, were found stuffed with concrete on the banks of the Mekong River.Amnesty's Chanathip said ""the identities of perpetrators remain unknown"" in most cases, ""despite the strong suspicion of state involvement given that the victims were all critics and dissidents.""Following the shooting of Lim Kimya in Bangkok, Thai Police Commissioner Pol Gen Kitrat Phanphet said the crime was ""not politically motivated but stems from personal conflicts."" Kitrat did not say how the police reached that conclusion.But Cambodian politician Sam Rainsy pointed the finger at the veteran ruler of Cambodia, Hun Sen, saying the ex-dictator was behind the killing.""Several dozen members of the opposition have been coldly assassinated,"" Rainsy said in an online post, adding he also faced multiple attempts on his life.On the day Lim Kimya was shot dead — which coincided with the anniversary of the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime — former prime minister Hun Sen, who in 2023 handed power to his son Hun Manet, called for a new law to label those attempting to topple his son's government as ""terrorists.""Lim Kimya's case is ""part of a long-standing and unchanging mistreatment"" that exiles and asylum seekers suffer in Thailand, Tyrell Haberkorn, a professor of Southeast Asian studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told DW.""What enables this to take place with impunity is an unwillingness to investigate or hold perpetrators to account,"" said Haberkorn.The governments of Thailand and Cambodia enjoy especially close ties. A 2024 report by Human Rights Watch attributed ""the intimidation and harassment, surveillance, and physical violence"" that Cambodian dissidents in Thailand face to Hun Sen's ties with former Thai Prime Minister Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha.In the aftermath of the Lim Kimya killing, Thai authorities need to determine ""whether there was collusion between elements of the Thai and the Cambodian political establishments,” Phongsathorn told DW.Despite its apparent failures in protecting dissidents, Thailand won its bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) last year. Its membership started on January 1 and is set to last three years.""Thailand's human rights performance will be under increased scrutiny, and the Thai state and government will be held to a higher standard as a member of the UNHRC,"" said Phongsathorn.However, it remains unclear how this would affect the alleged agreements with other governments ""regarding transnational repression,"" Phongsathorn added.While the UNHRC does not obligate its members to take any specific actions, the Thai government ""should use its membership term as an opportunity to take leadership in enhancing the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, both in Thailand and across the region,"" said Chanatip.",Former Cambodian lawmaker Lim Kimya was gunned down on January 7 in Thailand's capital.

As the political deputy at the Foreign Ministry, he stated there was no valid reason to deny education to females.The current Taliban administration has restricted female education beyond year six. Reports from September indicate that medical training and courses for women have also been halted, though authorities have not officially confirmed this restriction, AP news agency reported.The healthcare system in Afghanistan requires female medical professionals to treat women and girls. Stanikzai, speaking in a video posted on his official X account, emphasised that denying rights to half the population contradicts Islamic law and represents personal preferences rather than religious doctrine.Stanikzai, who previously led Taliban negotiations for foreign troop withdrawal, has advocated for women's education before. His recent statement, however, marks his first direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada for policy change.Crisis Group analyst Ibraheem Bahiss noted that while Stanikzai has consistently supported girls' education, his latest statement more explicitly challenges current policies and their legitimacy.At a recent conference in Islamabad, Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders to confront the Taliban regarding female education. The UN maintains that international recognition remains unlikely while restrictions on women's education, employment and movement persist.Whilst no nation officially recognises the Taliban government, some countries are establishing diplomatic connections. Russia has strengthened its ties, and India continues to develop relations with Afghan authorities, as evidenced by the recent meeting in Dubai between Indian diplomat Vikram Mistri and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",Sher Abbas Stanikzai is the political deputy at the Foreign Ministry.

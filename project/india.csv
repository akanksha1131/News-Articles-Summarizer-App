NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday took aim at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, contrasting his foreign-policy record with the achievements of the Chola dynasty he had praised a day earlier.On Sunday, PM Modi visited the Brihadisvara Temple in Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Ariyalur district, for the Aadi Thiruvathirai festival celebrating Emperor Rajendra Chola I’s birth anniversary.Calling the Chola era (roughly 300 BCE–1300 CE) “a golden age of cultural brilliance, strategic vision and naval prowess,” he released a commemorative coin, performed a symbolic pouring of Ganga water, and hailed Tamil Nadu as a guardian of living heritage.He also noted that since 2014 India has repatriated more than 600 artefacts, including 36 from Tamil Nadu.Congress MP Manickam Tagore, in a post on X, said, ""Cholas never had a failed intelligence system — unlike your government, Modi ji.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former home minister P Chidambaram has raised several questions about the Union government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor In an interview with news outlet The Quint, Chidambaram said the government has not provided enough information and accused it of being unwilling to share key details.""Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?"" he asked, referring to the April 22 attack in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.Chidambaram also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information. ""We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that give you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?"" he said.Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Chidambaram responded, ""I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised...The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so. ""He also questioned the role of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the investigation. ""They are unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks.

What is the Special Intensive Revision (SIR)?

Why SIR became a flashpoint in Parliament

Supreme Court steps in

Massive participation or mass fraud?

35 lakh voters untraceable

Online, SMS, and volunteer outreach used to reach every voter

Claims and objections window opens August 1

EC says all major political parties consulted

From Bihar to the nation: A wider SIR looms



Concerns about due process and transparency

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A political and legal battle is underway over the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. What was intended as a technical exercise to improve the accuracy of voter lists has escalated into a flashpoint in both Parliament and the Supreme Court, with opposition parties alleging disenfranchisement and voter fraud, while the poll body insists it is a necessary step to uphold electoral integrity.The Supreme Court is set to hear a petition today challenging the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, as the Opposition intensifies its attack on the government over the exercise. Led by the Congress, opposition parties have accused the Centre of using the revision process to target voters just months before the state heads to elections. The row over SIR has gained fresh momentum in Parliament as well, with protests disrupting proceedings of the House over the past week.The Election Commission of India (ECI) launched the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar on June 24. As per the centre, the objective was to update and clean up the electoral roll through house-to-house verification by Booth Level Officers (BLOs). The last such exercise in the state was conducted in 2003. With Bihar undergoing rapid urbanisation, youth enrolment, and internal migration, the ECI said the revision was crucial for ensuring accurate rolls ahead of state elections.While the Monsoon session was set to debate Operation Sindoor, the SIR exercise quickly became a parallel point of contention. INDIA bloc MPs have submitted multiple notices demanding a discussion on the matter, alleging that the SIR was being used to remove genuine voters from rolls. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju clarified that the Operation Sindoor debate would take priority, pushing SIR-related discussions to a later date — a decision that drew strong reactions from the Opposition.The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of pleas challenging the SIR. Petitioners argue that the exercise lacks legal safeguards and risks disenfranchising large swathes of the population. The lead petitioner, NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), claimed the exercise is ""arbitrary"" and violates Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The court has also questioned the exclusion of Aadhaar and ration cards as valid ID for voter verification.According to the EC, the SIR saw over 7.24 crore of Bihar’s 7.89 crore electors participate, a turnout rate of nearly 92%. However, multiple affidavits and field reports challenge this figure, suggesting enumeration forms were uploaded en masse by BLOs without voter consent. ADR and other petitioners claimed that even dead people were shown to have submitted forms, raising concerns of systemic fraud to meet internal targets.In its latest press note dated July 27, the Election Commission clarified the status of the 35 lakh voters flagged as missing. According to the ECI, many were found to have moved to other states or union territories, some were deceased, others did not submit their enumeration forms, and a few were simply not willing to register. The Commission emphasised that their exact status will be confirmed only after scrutiny by EROs and AEROs by 1 August. Importantly, all genuine electors can still be added during the claims and objections period starting 1 August.Over 5.7 crore SMSes were sent to registered mobile numbers, 29 lakh forms were submitted digitally, and BLOs made multiple home visits. Volunteers also assisted senior citizens, PwDs, and vulnerable groups in accessing forms and filing appeals, with training provided for redressal mechanisms.The EC has said that no name will be deleted without a “speaking order” and due notice. The draft rolls will be published on August 1, and electors or parties can file claims or objections till September 1. Appeals can be made to the District Magistrate or CEO if needed.In a detailed affidavit to the Supreme Court, the ECI defended the SIR as essential for removing ineligible voters and ensuring free and fair elections. Citing Articles 326 and provisions of the Representation of People Act, the Commission insisted it was fulfilling its constitutional duty. EC also claimed all major political parties were consulted and that over 1.5 lakh Booth Level Agents were deployed. However, the ADR contested that no political party had asked for a complete overhaul.In its June 24 directive, the ECI announced that SIR will eventually be conducted nationwide. With 96.88 crore voters in India, even a small error rate could affect millions. ANI said the findings in Bihar have heightened concerns about systemic issues that could emerge in other states, especially where similar migration patterns exist. The draft electoral rolls will be published on August 1, with a window for objections open until September 1.Critics say the SIR is being conducted in a way that violates procedural fairness. ADR’s affidavit to the court alleged that forms were submitted by BLOs without physical verification, and that there were no proper channels for redress. The EC has argued that appeals can be made under Section 24 of the RP Act, but complainants say awareness and accessibility are limited. With conflicting narratives and high stakes, the SIR has now evolved from a bureaucratic exercise to a national controversy.","The Supreme Court is set to hear a petition challenging the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

Justice Verma Removal Case Sparks BJP-Congress Face-Off Amid VP Jagdeep Dhankhar’s Shock Resignation

LS Speaker may write to CJI this week for panel members’ names

NEW DELHI: Facing removal motion in Parliament for sacks of cash found at his official residence in Delhi, Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court while seeking quashing of the in-house inquiry report and then CJI's recommendation for stripping him of judgeship.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih is scheduled to hear his petition on Monday. In the petition, his name is described as ""XXX"". Such camouflage is used in records of SC and HCs to hide the identity of petitioner women who were sexually harassed or assaulted. It is also used to prevent revealing the identity of juveniles, and minors in matrimonial custody battles. SC has in many judgments asked all courts not to reveal the names of rape survivors in judgments.Justice Varma's plea - titled ""XXX vs Union of India"" - is the 699th civil writ petition filed in SC this year. While the Centre is the first respondent, SC itself is the second respondent. It was filed on July 17, and after the advocate on record rectified defects pointed out by the registry, SC registered the petition on July 24.Interestingly, while the petition ""XXX vs Union of India"" is listed at serial number 56 before the bench headed by Justice Datta, another petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, seeking registration of FIR against Justice Varma to unravel the mystery behind the cash, its burning and subsequent disappearance, is listed at serial number 59 before the same bench on Monday.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha has admitted a notice for removal against Justice Varma signed by more than 150 MPs. The LS speaker is likely to write this week to CJI B R Gavai seeking names of an SC judge and an HC chief justice, who would be part of an inquiry committee under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968.The speaker will nominate a distinguished jurist to complete the composition of the three-member committee headed by the SC judge. Repatriated to the Allahabad HC from the Delhi HC after the 'cash-in-kothi' controversy, Justice Varma in his petition has challenged the validity of the in-house inquiry report finding him guilty of the unaccounted cash at his residential premises and requested SC to declare the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's May 8 recommendation to the President and the PM for his removal as unconstitutional.","Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court.

"TCS layoffs: 12,000 employees to lose their jobs; Tata Consultancy Services plans 2% workforce cut over the year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-to-lay-off-around-12000-employees-tata-consultancy-services-plans-2-workforce-cut-over-the-year-what-you-should-know/articleshow/122934599.cms,"Tata Consultancy Services plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 2%, impacting over 12,000 employees due to economic uncertainties and AI-driven technological changes. The company will provide affected staff with severance benefits, outplacement services, and extended insurance coverage.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits.

Fertility scam busted: 8 held in baby-selling scam in Hyderabad; clinic run by mother-son duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fertility-scam-busted-8-held-in-baby-selling-scam-in-hyderabad-clinic-run-by-mother-son-duo/articleshow/122937391.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: An illegal surrogacy and baby-selling racket operating out of a fertility clinic in Hyderabad was busted Sunday, leading to the arrest of eight individuals, including the clinic’s owner and fertility specialist, Dr A Namratha.A detailed investigation revealed that Namratha, 64, was running a large-scale scam through clinics located in Vijayawada, Secunderabad, Visakhapatnam, and Kondapur. She allegedly collected between Rs 20–30 lakh from each client under false pretenses, police said.Police further disclosed that Namratha’s son, an advocate by profession, managed the clinic’s financial operations from the same premises. He also reportedly intimidated clients who raised objections.Authorities, as cited by PTI, added that over 10 previous cases had been registered against the accused at various police stations across Andhra Pradesh. Despite the medical and health department cancelling the clinic’s registration earlier, it continued operations using the name of another certified doctor on official documents.The clinic at Gopalapuram in Hyderabad was sealed with assistance from the medical department.The racket resurfaced after a couple, who believed their child was born through surrogacy, discovered through a DNA test that the baby was not biologically theirs. Alarmed, the couple approached the police.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North Zone–Hyderabad) S Rashmi Perumal told PTI that Dr Namratha, along with her associates and agents, targeted vulnerable women—particularly those seeking abortions—and persuaded them to continue their pregnancies in exchange for money or other inducements. These newborns were then passed off as surrogate babies, misleading clients into believing they were their biological children.According to the police, the victim couple had approached Namratha’s clinic in August 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. After initial tests, they were advised to opt for surrogacy. They were then referred to the clinic’s Visakhapatnam branch for specimen collection and were told the clinic would arrange a surrogate and handle the embryo transplant.Over the course of nine months, the couple made several payments totaling more than Rs 35 lakh. In June 2025, they were informed that a baby boy had been delivered via C-section in Visakhapatnam. The child was handed over to them along with documentation falsely listing them as the biological parents.""The baby was not shown as a child born to a surrogate, which drew their suspicion. Later, the couple went in for DNA test which revealed that the child’s DNA did not match theirs,"" said Rashmi.When the couple sought clarification from the clinic, they were denied documentation and threatened, prompting them to file a police complaint.In the current case, police traced the baby’s biological parents, originally from Assam and residing in Hyderabad, through agents. They had reportedly been paid a small amount after giving up the child.

But when they did the DNA test it was revealed as not matching with theirs.""

"Varma row: Ignoring RS notice illegal, says Congress; 'petty mindset'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ignoring-rajya-sabha-notice-illegal-says-congress/articleshow/122941330.cms,"Abhishek Manu Singhvi

NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"", Congress on Saturday said the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma in Rajya Sabha in favour of the one submitted in Lok Sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue, stemming from its ""insecurity"" that the opposition had scored on corruption by moving first in the upper house. LS notice is bipartisan signed by 152 MPs, while the one in RS is exclusively signed by opposition members.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi slammed the announcement by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju , alleging it was now clear that former RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar's belated independent act on the Varma issue riled the Modi government and resulted in his ouster. With Rijiju saying that the RS had not ""admitted"" the notice, Singhvi said Dhankhar mentioned the notice in the House in detail on Monday talking about it meeting legal and numerical requirements, which was tantamount to admitting it. The Congress MP asked the government if RS should be giving long judgments like a judicial court to show ""admission"".Interestingly, Singhvi, a senior lawyer, alleged BJP MPs signed a blank paper in the room of defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, which was likely an ""impeachment notice against Dhankhar"". He warned that the government may be committing a major violation by constituting the statutory committee to probe Varma exclusively on the LS notice.","Abhishek Singhvi accuses BJP of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"" He says the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma in Rajya Sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122941387,imgsize-905370,width-400,resizemode-4/122941387.jpg"

Oppn plans to point to big terror attacks under ‘PM Modi’s watch’

GANGAIKONDA CHOLAPURAM/NEW DELHI: A day ahead of the parliamentary debate on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor , PM Narendra Modi on Sunday reasserted that the precision strikes on terror dens in Pakistan was India's message that there are no safe havens for terrorists and their masters.India places the highest priority on its national security and the operation has created a new awakening and a new self-confidence across the country, Modi said at an event in Tamil Nadu's Gangaikonda Cholapuram to honour Chola emperor Rajendra Chola.The world witnessed India's firm and decisive response to the threat against its sovereignty during Operation Sindoor and it has sent a clear message, there is no safe haven for terrorists and enemies of the nation, he said, setting the tone for the govt's response for the debate in Parliament, starting in Lok Sabha on Monday.The upcoming discussion in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the attack and the operation comes as a significant opportunity for the govt to reaffirm its strong stance on national security and counter-terrorism.The debate - after a first week of disruption of Parliament's Monsoon session - is likely to be a fiery one between the ruling alliance and the opposition as they prepare to lock horns over the issues steeped in national security and foreign policy imperatives.The two sides have consented to a marathon 16-hour debate in each House, which invariably stretches longer in practice. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh is likely to initiate the debate immediately after the question hour in Lok Sabha.Sources said home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will be speaking on the issues amid indications that the PM may make an intervention to convey his govt's ""robust"" stand against terrorism Leaders of opposition in LS and RS - Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge - may lead the charge against the govt along with Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav, besides a host of others. Congress , however, plans to attack the govt and particularly PM Modi on what BJP has claimed to be their calling card over a decade, and have used incessantly to target Congress over national security.More than Operation Sindoor, the opposition would be looking to hammer home that the country has been extremely unsafe from cross border threats, pointing to repeated big terror attacks under Modi's watch, from Uri to Pahalgam. This will also put Shah in the oppositions crosshairs.It is here that the opposition plans to undercut Modi's claim on national security. As has been seen since the terror attack, Congress and opposition have been pointing to the fact that the terrorists singled out the tourists by religion to execute them - a point that the opposition would have been reluctant to touch in the past for fear of polarisation.Congress ahead of the debate raised the issue of US President Donald Trump's claims of halting Operation Sindoor. Party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said since May 10, Trump has claimed ""26 times"" that he stopped the operation by ""threatening to cut off trade with India, and claimed that five fighter jets may have been shot down"".Ramesh on X said ""even though Congress had been demanding a special two-day session of Parliament immediately after Operation Sindoor was abruptly halted that demand was ignored.

Individual farmers from villages where land is being 'pooled' - those so far not associated with farm organisations - are now turning towards them to oppose the scheme.The policy aims to pool over 40,000 acres of farmland to promote planned urban development. It's a land-for-land scheme, where landowners voluntarily give up land and are given developed residential and commercial plots in exchange.SKM's green light to its Punjab chapter to hold tractor rallies on July 30 in villages that are likely to be brought under land-pooling scheme has come as a boost to forces opposing the scheme.

The premature delivery was triggered by a cervical pessary procedure performed without informed consent.This procedure set off a chain of events that ended in the baby developing gangrene. According to district consumer disputes redressal commission, Chennai (North), the premature insertion done without adequate testing or emergency justification led to complications including abdominal pain, bleeding, and ultimately, preterm delivery at just 24 weeks.The baby, born with low birth weight and no spontaneous breathing, suffered from poor blood circulation. During post-delivery care and transfer to NICU, swelling and blackened fingertips developed early signs of gangrene.The commission held that the hospital and gynaecologist failed to monitor and manage the baby's fragile postnatal condition, and could not explain how the circulatory failure that caused the gangrene occurred. The cervical pessary procedure was deemed the starting point of a sequence that resulted in the injury.The child's mother was undergoing fertility treatment and was 22 weeks pregnant when the device was inserted, despite a medical scan showing only a 9% risk of spontaneous preterm birth. A pessary is inserted into the vagina to support the cervix and to delay premature labour in high-risk pregnancies.However, the anomaly scan done on July 4, 2023, merely advised progesterone or cerclage ""after discussion with the obstetrician"". Instead, the gynaecologist at Srinivas Priya Hospital inserted the pessary on the same day without waiting, without mandatory antenatal tests, and without documented prior consent.The commission ruled that the hospital and the gynaecologist failed to justify the emergency nature of the procedure or explain why informed consent was bypassed.

MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Amid speculation about an alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS for the civic polls, Raj Thackeray made a rare visit to Matoshree, Uddhav Thackeray's residence, to wish his ""big brother"" on his 65th birthday. Uddhav welcomed Raj with a hug, while the latter presented him a bouquet of red roses. After the courtesies, the cousins spoke for close to 20 minutes. Raj also paid tributes to his late uncle Bal Thackeray's memorial chair on the first floor at Matoshree.Since parting ways with Shiv Sena two decades ago, Raj has visited Matoshree just a couple of times, the last time in 2019 to invite Uddhav to his son's wedding.In what's seen as a snub to deputy CM and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde, Raj later referred to Uddhav as ""Shiv Sena chief"" on X.While political observers said the two cousins meeting second time in less than a month is an indication of a political reunion for the local body polls slated for Nov-Dec, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis downplayed it, terming the visit purely personal.""Raj Thackeray met Uddhav on account of his birthday. I don't think one should see a political angle in everything,"" said Fadnavis, while speaking to reporters in Nagpur.Responding to an earlier remark on the possibility of the alliance by Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut that ""whatever is in the mind of Maharashtra will ultimately happen"", Fadnavis said, ""I feel there is something only in the mind of certain leaders. Else, what's in the mind of Maharashtra we got to know during [assembly] polls.""Speaking briefly to the media after Raj's visit, Uddhav appeared visibly emotional. ""I am very happy. I am overwhelmed...,"" he said, declining to elaborate.Later, Raj said in a post on X: ""On the occasion of my big brother, Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray's birthday, I visited Matoshree, the residence of the late Balasaheb Thackeray, to extend my best wishes."" Raj's reference to Uddhav as Shiv Sena chief was also a snub to deputy chief minister Ekanth Shinde, who is president of the Shiv Sena officially recognised by the Election Commission (EC) after the party split.Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and MLC Ambadas Danve and MNS netas Bala Nandgaonkar and Nitin Sardesai were among those present during Raj's visit to Matoshree, which was decked up with flowers and banners to mark Uddhav's birthday. At midnight, Uddhav cut a cake with wife Rashmi and son Aaditya amid sloganeering in a room packed with Sainiks.""All together, No problem at all!"" Raut said in a post on X, sharing a group photo with Raj and Uddhav.""Both the brothers did it without saying a word. This is the beginning of the future. This incident united the divided Maharashtra, there cannot be a happier day like today. Therefore, today is a day of joy and inspiration for the Marathi people,"" Sena (UBT) MLA Bhaskar Jadhav said.Political observers said Raj's visit to Matoshree was a reciprocal step to Uddhav's comments that the two cousins had ""come together to be together"" during the July 5 'victory rally' in Mumbai after state govt withdrew its decision to introduce Hindi from classes 1 to 5.""At the July 5 rally itself Uddhav had said that the two cousins have come together to stay together. Later too, Uddhav made it clear that an alliance was on the cards in his interviews and speeches. So, Raj seems to have taken a step forward by visiting him,"" said a political observer. ""Raj going to Matoshree also has sentimental value for Shiv Sainiks; it is a kind of homecoming. In fact, it has more optical and sentimental value than the two cousins coming together at the rally at Worli's NSCI Dome. In the minds of the Sainiks, Matoshree has sanctity and Raj going there is also an acceptance on his part of Uddhav as a big brother and Sena (UBT) president.

300 trekkers rescued from forest in 7hr operation at Malshej Ghat as Kalu river rises,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/300-trekkers-rescued-from-forest-in-7hr-operation-at-malshej-ghat-as-kalu-river-rises/articleshow/122940110.cms,"300 trekkers rescued from forest in 7hr operation at Malshej Ghat as Kalu river rises

PUNE: In a seven-hour operation on Saturday, forest staffers and locals rescued 300 trekkers, including 100 women, after they were left stranded in the forest at Malshej Ghat where the level of the Kalu river increased because of rainfall measuring 200mm in three hours.The incident happened at Waghachi Wadi on the Thane-Pune border, about 150km from Pune city, near the Kalyan-Ahilyanagar highway. The rescue effort commenced at 3pm and continued until 10pm, successfully bringing to safety the trekkers — mostly from Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.Officials from Thane and Junnar forest divisions, who were part of the rescue effort, said most trekkers had arrived early in the morning and had not anticipated the heavy showers or rise in the river water.The state disaster management cell and the district administrations informed the rescuers about the incident after receiving calls for help. The operation was particularly difficult, as locals had to swim through the gushing water to secure ropes and harnesses to trees and use a zipline to transport individuals across the river.Local resident of Morushi village Bhaskar Mengal (24), who was amongst the first to respond to the crisis, said, ""There was no way to reach the trekkers other than to swim through the gushing and rising water.I swam across the river to tie ropes and harness to the trees. The tourists were scared and I had to calm them down. We first rescued the women after explaining how to use a zipline to cross the river and allaying fears about a fall. We sent them across one by one. Later, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.""Range forest officer of Tokavade forest range in Thane district Rajvardhan Bhosale told TOI that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest on Saturday morning without consulting the villagers. They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to the situation where the river's water level suddenly rose within a few hours. The area is treacherous and risky for outsiders,"" he added.Meanwhile, Pokla said, ""The stranded trekkers panicked and were hesitant to follow our instructions as it started to turn dark. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.""Forest officials said tourists prefer to approach the Kalu river waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, the zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes.Junnar division's assistant forest officer Smita Rajhans said, ""Visitors from Maharashtra and other states flock to Junnar and surrounding areas for monsoon treks after watching videos on social media. They often disregard their safety and forget to hire locals for guidance. They attempt adventurous activities in dense forest zones leading to difficult situations.""Kalu WaterfallKalu Waterfall is situated in Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil — which is part of the Malshej Ghat region. It is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, during monsoon. The river cascades from a height of 1,200ft, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and district.However, locals have been voicing concerns about protocol at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents. Visitors are compulsively drawn to the site after watching videos on social media.","300 trekkers rescued from forest in 7hr operation at Malshej Ghat as Kalu river rises.

Delhi HC rejects bail of suspected Isis member in arms case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-rejects-bail-of-suspected-isis-member-in-arms-case/articleshow/122940060.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi HC has rejected the bail plea of a suspected Isis member accused of procuring arms and ammunition for the proscribed outfit and using social media to promote its objectives. In a recent order, a bench of justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar upheld a trial court detention order, stating it was not mechanical in nature. HC said accused Mohd Rizwan Ashraf could not be released due to the ongoing investigation, as releasing him and others at a crucial stage would impede the probe.""This court is satisfied that the trial court applied its mind to the grounds set forth. The trial court categorically observed the investigation progressed substantially during remand extensions granted by it and the investigation was not stagnant. Order of the trial court extended custody not as a matter of routine but based on credible material outlining the investigative steps requiring completion,"" the bench observed.Ashraf was arrested by NIA in 2023 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) provisions. He challenged various orders of the trial court extending his custody, including on Feb 24, 2024, when his judicial custody was extended by 25 days.On the same day, the trial court dismissed his plea for default bail. Ashraf's counsel submitted the orders were passed by the trial court in a mechanical and perfunctory manner and did not indicate any individual assessment of his role. He argued NIA failed to demonstrate why Ashraf's continued detention was necessary for probe. However, HC said three accused persons, including Ashraf, were active ISIS and they were propagating the ideology of the organisation and trying to recruit youth for its objectives.""At the time when the remand orders were being considered, material was being unearthed to establish that the accused, including the appellant (Ashraf), were conducting recce at various Indian cities including, but not limited to, Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Surat for terrorist activities,"" it pointed out, adding conspiracy was also being hatched in other countries. ""A money trail from Maldives was also being investigated. Material on record indicates that investigation was also underway to find out about other associates of the accused,"" HC noted.","Mohd Rizwan Ashraf was arrested by NIA in 2023 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

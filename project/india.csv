'No coincidence': Amit Malviya targets Pawan Khera's wife over 2 voter IDs; drags in Sonia's 1980 entry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-coincidence-amit-malviya-targets-pawan-kheras-wife-over-2-voter-ids-drags-in-sonias-1980-entry/articleshow/123667790.cms,"Pawan Khera and Amit Malviya (R)

Voter ID Row: BJP Targets Pawan Khera With Double ID Claim, He Retorts With Big Charge On EC

NEW DELHI: BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya on Wednesday intensified his attack on the Congress, this time targeting Pawan Khera's wife and Congress leader Kota Neelima. Malviya alleged that Neelima holds ""two active EPICs - one registered Khairatabad and another in New Delhi. ""He also hit out at Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress leader held a press conference without ""adequate due diligence."" Malviya claimed Rahul “targeted and tarnished honest voters — even putting them at risk by revealing their identities without consent. He doxxed young, upwardly mobile professionals and poor daily wagers who had moved cities in search of better opportunities.”Referring to Rahul’s earlier allegations of “vote chori” and claims that the Election Commission was “colluding with the BJP” during recent assembly elections, Malviya added: “Yet, he has maintained an equivocal silence on the shocking revelation that his close aide holds two EPIC cards. Is he the only one? Apparently not.”Malviya further alleged that “it’s now quite obvious” that Congress leaders hold multiple voter IDs across constituencies. “This is no coincidence,” he said, also drawing Sonia Gandhi into the row: “The rot isn’t limited to Pawan Khera and family. It goes back to the top — when Sonia Gandhi, an Italian, managed to get her name included in the voter list in 1980.”This fresh round of accusations comes a day after Malviya had claimed that Pawan Khera himself held two EPICs.Following that, the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) of New Delhi issued a notice to Khera, stating that his name appears in both the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, and asked why action should not be taken against him.Khera, however, hit back at the Election Commission, alleging bias. He said the poll body functions “to support the ruling regime” and questioned why no notice had been issued to “the 1,00,000 fake voters of Mahadevapura constituency” in Karnataka, as highlighted earlier by Rahul Gandhi.","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya has intensified his attack on the Congress.

"Bengal differs with TN in SC, asserts governor's discretionary powers on bills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-differs-with-tn-in-sc-asserts-governors-discretionary-powers-on-bills/articleshow/123667690.cms,"NEW DELHI: Partly differing with another opposition-governed state Tamil Nadu and somewhat concurring with the Centre's stand on the Presidential Reference in the Supreme Court, West Bengal on Tuesday said the Constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors in dealing with bills presented to him after being passed by state legislatures.When senior advocate Kapil Sibal was prefacing arguments on behalf of West Bengal after conclusion of senior advocate A M Singhvi's pithy opposition to Presidential Reference, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar asked a pointed question - ""Do governors have discretion in exercise of options provided under Article 200 of the Constitution in relations to bills? How does he decide to take recourse to one of the four options?""The question assumed importance as opposition governed states - TN, WB, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Punjab - have joined ranks to oppose the Presidential Reference. Singhvi had vehemently argued that a governor, being merely ornamental head of executive in a state with no legislative function, is always bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers led by the CM, even in exercise of options - granting assent to a bill, withholding it, returning bill for reconsideration by the legislature or reserving it for President's consideration.For TN, Singhvi elaborated upon his argument by listing possible scenarios: If the council of ministers feel that it is not the appropriate time to make a bill a law given the situation in the state, then it can advise a governor to withhold assent for sometime; if it felt that a Bill was passed hurriedly and required some changes, then it would advise him to return it to legislature for carrying out the changes; and if it felt that the law may be repugnant to central law, it can advise a governor to reserve it for President's consideration.Sibal, appearing for West Bengal, disagreed and said a governor certainly has some discretion under Article 200. ""A governor, while exercising the options of returning a bill to legislature, or reserving a bill for President's consideration, is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers and takes a decision on his discretion,"" he said.He said, ""Governor is certainly not a postman (to do whatever is told to him by the council of ministers). Otherwise why have a governor at all? But this does not mean a governor would act against the will of the people reflected in a bill passed by the legislature. Our Constitutional scheme mandates a collaborative effort between the executive and the legislature. The governor cannot take a combative position to have confrontation with the council of ministers or the legislature to subvert governance. ""Senior advocate Sibal said governors cannot be permitted to withhold assent indefinitely to negate the will of the people and his actions in this regard would always be subject to judicial review. ""Any absolute power conferred on a governor would create a constitutional conundrum. The concept of withholding assent is always temporary.""Sibal will continue his submissions Wednesday.The President sent a Reference to SC seeking its opinion on 14 questions, mainly on SC's power to grant deemed assent and fix timelines for President and governors, after a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Apr 8 granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending with the TN governor and fixed timelines for the constitutional heads of executive at the Centre and states for taking decision on bills passed by the legislature.","West Bengal says Constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors in dealing with bills presented to him after being passed by state legislatures.

Wadephul will also hold talks with commerce minister Piyush Goyal, as the two countries look to expand their trade and investment ties.The visit is taking place days after a ""brainstorming"" meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers in which the participants discussed the way forward in their support for Ukraine. One of the measures mulled was secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners, which could complicate India's energy ties with Russia.These issues are likely to be discussed during Wadephul's meetings here, sources said. Jaishankar had told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation last week that India should not be unfairly targeted over Ukraine conflict. He is again likely to stress that India has always backed dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict and wants it to end at the earliest.This was also the message conveyed to President Vladimir Putin by PM Narendra Modi at their meeting in China on Monday. Wadephul has expressed doubts about whether Putin is really interested in peace talks and wants more pressure applied on Russia, including through a fresh EU package of sanctions.Jaishankar and Wadephul will address the media after their talks Wednesday.","Germany's foreign minister Johann David Wadephul is visiting India.

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year’s festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, “Dwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‘The Smashing Machine.’ This was the most emotion we’ve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‘The Whale.’”The comparison to Fraser’s Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson’s awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson’s raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, “I looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people’s dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.”Safdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr’s now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3. If the reaction in Venice is any indication, Johnson may have delivered the most defining performance of his career.

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India to further his family’s business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself.He was asked about America’s trade row with India and Trump’s repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.“I think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,” Sullivan said in response to the host’s question, which also mentioned the Trump family’s Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook’s Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, “the world's largest democracy,” and a country it should be “aligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.”Sullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. “And now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,” he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. “But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,” Sullivan said.According to him, America’s credibility was at stake. “And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”During the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump’s earlier claims about being “best friends with Modi” and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began “taking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ”The host further alleged, “Donald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?”Sullivan reiterated, “I think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China. And we had come a long way on that. And now in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, Trump has thrown the India relationship over the side. That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US India relationship serves our interests. But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States. And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not to in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”Before concluding, Sullivan remarked, “It's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.” The host thanked him, saying, “Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.”The controversy comes amid Trump’s increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff’s son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. “President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it “historic” and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India. Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself. The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties withIndia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123647169,imgsize-1024872,width-400,resizemode-4/jake-sullivan-donald-trump.jpg"

PM Modi Will Soon Dedicate India’s 1st Made-In-India Semiconductor Chip From Sanand Plant: Vaishnaw





Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday received the country’s first made-in-India semiconductor chip at the inauguration of Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi.Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw presented the Vikram 32-bit processor, developed by Isro ’s Semiconductor Lab, along with test chips from four approved projects.According to news agency ANI, Vaishnaw said the achievement reflects the country’s rapid progress under the India Semiconductor Mission launched in 2021. “Just a few years ago, we met for the first time to make a new beginning driven by our Prime Minister’s farsighted vision. In a short span of 3.5 years, we have the world looking at India with confidence. Today, the construction of five Semiconductor units is going on at a rapid pace…We just presented the first ‘Made-in-India’ chip to PM Modi,” he stated.Vaishnaw added that despite global policy turmoil, India has emerged as a “lighthouse of stability and growth.”The Vikram processor, fully indigenous, has been qualified for use in harsh launch vehicle conditions, ANI reported.The minister highlighted India’s semiconductor ecosystem push, including the Rs 76,000 crore Production Linked Incentive scheme, of which nearly Rs 65,000 crore has already been committed.He also referred to the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) Pilot Line Facility launched in Sanand, Gujarat, with CG-Semi expected to roll out chips soon.As per ANI, the government has sanctioned 23 design projects under the Design Linked Incentive scheme, while 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.6 lakh crore have been approved across Gujarat, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.Industry leaders also hailed India’s growing role. Tim Archer, CEO of Lam Research, said India is laying the foundation for a “resilient semiconductor ecosystem” as the global market moves toward the $1 trillion mark.Kai Beckmann of Merck projected India’s local semiconductor market would reach $100 billion by 2030, while AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company’s $400 million India investment plan announced at last year’s Semicon event.Beckmann stressed collaboration, calling semiconductors a “team sport,” while Papermaster praised India’s “extraordinary talent base” and government backing.The three-day Semicon India 2025 aims to position India as a global hub for chip design, manufacturing, and innovation, focusing on building a robust and sustainable ecosystem, ANI reported.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the country’s first made-in-India semiconductor chip at the inauguration of Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi.

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India’s strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, “India is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.”Global technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world’s leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work — translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a “boss versus worker” setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India’s policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India’s semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. “We consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,” Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “soon” dedicate the country’s first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India’s semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers.

Maratha Quota Activist Manoj Jarange Patil Breaks Fast After Accepting Maharashtra Govt Resolution

Why Jarange claimed victory



Jarange breaks fast



Government issues GR



Court intervention and apology



NEW DELHI: Scenes of celebration were seen at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on Tuesday after Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange announced victory for the agitation. This came after the Maharashtra government’s cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, headed by minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, accepted most of his demands.Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike, saying that the government had agreed to give Kunbi caste certificates to eligible Marathas. His supporters cheered the development, which also brought relief to Mumbai residents.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also hailed activist Manoj Jarange's move to call off his 5-day fast over the Maratha quota demand, saying the government found a solution in the interest of the Maratha community.""My objective was to give justice to the Maratha community. My government was always focused on the welfare of Marathas and I will continue to work for all communities in Maharashtra, be it Marathas or OBCs,"" the CM said.The Kunbi status will allow members of the Maratha community to seek benefits under the OBC quota, which has been Jarange’s main demand.""We will leave Mumbai by 9 pm (Tuesday) if the Maharashtra government issues GRs (government resolutions) on the Maratha quota demands,"" Jarange said.The sub-committee accepted his demand to implement the Hyderabad Gazetteer and assured that Marathas with Kunbi records will be given caste certificates after proper inquiry.Jarange told his supporters that the committee has agreed to issue a GR immediately and that the Satara Gazetteer will be implemented within a month.He added that the government has promised to withdraw cases against Maratha protesters by the end of September. The committee also said financial aid and jobs according to educational qualifications will be given within a week to families of those who died during the protests.According to Jarange, the committee informed him that Rs 15 crore has already been given to the families of deceased protesters, and the remaining compensation will be provided within a week.Later in the day, Jarange ended his fast after accepting the GR issued by the cabinet sub-committee. Vikhe Patil thanked him for agreeing to the proposal and breaking his fast.The Maharashtra government issued a resolution on the Hyderabad Gazetteer and announced the setting up of committees to enable Marathas to obtain Kunbi caste certificates if they can provide documentary proof showing they were recorded as Kunbis in the past.The GR said, ""In accordance with the historical references contained in the Hyderabad gazetteer, a dedicated scrutiny process shall be conducted to verify documents and establish eligibility of persons from the Maratha community for Kunbi caste certificates. The committee shall ensure that every claim is assessed in a time-bound and transparent manner.""Activist Manoj Jarange has been demanding that Marathas be recognised as Kunbis, an agrarian caste listed in the OBC category in Maharashtra. Such classification would make Marathas eligible for reservation in government jobs and education.Earlier on Tuesday, the Bombay high court ordered Jarange and his supporters to vacate Azad Maidan by 3 pm, noting that they did not have permission to protest there. The court later allowed him to stay until Wednesday morning.The court criticised the state government’s handling of the matter and warned it would take strict action to uphold the law. Following this, the cabinet sub-committee met Jarange at the protest site in the afternoon.This development came four days after Jarange and thousands of supporters reached Azad Maidan demanding a 10 per cent quota for Marathas under the OBC category.Jarange had said he was open to talks but would not leave Mumbai until his demands were met. He also said, ""Nobody can stop Maratha protesters from coming to Mumbai by this weekend.""However, after the high court’s directive to vacate the ground, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde apologised to the court on behalf of Jarange and his team for the behaviour of some protesters on city streets.As the deadline neared, Mumbai Police asked protesters to remove vehicles parked near Azad Maidan. Security personnel also cleared protesters from CSMT, where they had gathered for four days.According to officials, GRP and RPF personnel, along with 60 members of the Riot Control Force, were deployed at CSMT in south Mumbai.","Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike, saying that the government had agreed to give Kunbi caste certificates to eligible Marathas.

Twin cloudbursts led to Kishtwar tragedy: Deputy Commissioner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/twin-cloudbursts-led-to-kishtwar-tragedy-deputy-commissioner/articleshow/123664300.cms,"SRINAGAR: A preliminary investigation has found that two cloudbursts occurred approximately 13km from the remote village of Chasoti in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Aug 14, triggering flash floods that killed 65 people and left several missing.“Chasoti (tragedy) was not a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood event,” Kishtwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma said, adding that the findings were based on a joint study by a mountaineering team and geological experts. J&K Police’s mountain rescue team also contributed to the report after studying the area along with a mountaineer who has summited Mt Everest.The dual cloudbursts had unleashed torrents of water, mud, boulders, and uprooted trees that swept into the small hamlet nestled in Chenab Valley — the last village en route Machail Mata temple — where hundreds of pilgrims had been camping. The surge hit around 11.40am, flattening everything in its war — houses, langars, three temples, vehicles, and even a bridge.A 2024-2025 govt study on GLOFs in Kishtwar is being discussed again. In the report, the district disaster management authority had warned that GLOF presents significant challenges to the community, infrastructure, and the environment in the region. It also stated that GLOFs present a major hazard to Padder, Machail, Dachhan, Marwah, and Warwan tehsils and areas near Kishtwar high altitude national park.These places are especially vulnerable due to their proximity to glacial lakes, making them prone to sudden flooding events that can have a devastating impact on the region. The report highlighted that Marwah and Warwan were more susceptible to danger and are designated “shadow areas” due to their remoteness, low-lying settlements and limited disaster preparedness and emergency response capacity. On Aug 26 this year, Warwan Valley was hit by a cloudburst, damaging around 190 houses and killing 45 cattle.GLOF events also pose a threat to Padder tehsil, which houses major power projects, the report stated. Infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals, etc.) in Machail, Dachhan, and Marwah is also at considerable risk, the report said.","A preliminary investigation has found that two cloudbursts occurred approximately 13km from the remote village of Chasoti in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Aug 14, triggering flash floods that killed 65 people and left several missing. “Chasoti (tragedy) was not a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood event,” KishTwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma said.

‘Insult To Every Mother’: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother

Poll Should political parties be held accountable for remarks made during rallies? Yes, they should be No, it's free speech

Video of clash went viral



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday broke his silence with a sharp rebuttal over the Bihar rally row, after a viral video allegedly showed abusive remarks directed at his late mother. He called the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Speaking at an event of the Bihar Rajya Jeevika Nidhi Saakh Sahkari Sangh Limited, PM Modi said, ""Mother is our world. Mother is our self-respect. I had not even imagined what happened a few days ago in this tradition-rich Bihar. My mother was abused from the stage of RJD-Congress in Bihar... These abuses are not just an insult to my mother. These are insults to the mothers, sisters and daughters of the country. I know.. . how bad all of you, every mother of Bihar, felt after seeing and hearing this! I know, as much pain as I have in my heart, the people of Bihar are also in the same pain.""PM Modi went on to say that his late mother had distanced him from herself so that he could dedicate his life to serving the nation.He said, ""My mother separated me from her so that I could serve crores of mothers like you. You all know that now my mother is not alive. Some time ago, after completing 100 years of age, she left us all. That mother of mine, who had nothing to do with politics, who is no more, was abused from the stage of the RJD, Congress. Sisters and mothers, I can see your faces; I can only imagine the pain you must have felt. I can see tears in the eyes of some mothers. This is very sad, painful.""Slamming the RJD-Congress over remarks targeting his mother, PM Narendra Modi said, ""'Yuvraaj,' born in a royal family with golden and silver spoons, cannot understand the pain of a poor mother.""His remarks came days after a video went viral on social media, purportedly showing unidentified men hurling abuses at PM Modi and his late mother from the stage of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Darbhanga, held along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , a key ally of the BJP in the upcoming state assembly polls, also condemned the incident.In a post on X, he said, ""During the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Darbhanga, the use of highly inappropriate language against the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and his late mother from the platform of Congress and RJD is utterly deplorable, and I condemn it.""BJP and Congress workers clashed in Patna last week after the saffron party staged a protest over alleged abuses directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his mother during a rally in Darbhanga.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday rebuffed political parties' clamour for a directive to EC to accept Aadhaar card as standalone proof of citizenship to enable people to enroll in the Bihar voter list prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) and said the status of Aadhaar cannot be enhanced beyond what has been laid down in the law.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, which had earlier said Aadhaar could be an identity document along with other documents specified by EC for enrolment in the voter list, said on Monday: ""Aadhaar will be one of the documents for verification"".When RJD counsel Prashant Bhushan said EC is not accepting Aadhaar as a standalone proof of identity for the 65 lakh names deleted from the draft voter list despite the court's orders, the bench said, ""We cannot enhance the status of Aadhaar beyond what is ascribed to it by the Aadhaar Act. We can also not go beyond what was said by a five-judge bench in Puttaswamy judgment while upholding Aadhaar"".Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act says: ""The Aadhaar number or the authentication thereof shall not, by itself, confer any right of, or be proof of, citizenship or domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder.""In the Sept 2018 Puttaswamy case judgment, a five-judge bench of SC had said, ""An Aadhaar number also does not, by itself, constitute a conferment of a right of citizenship, or domicile"".When counsels for other petitioners, including political parties, joined in the pitch to elevate Aadhaar from a biometric proof of identity to proof of one's citizenship for registration as a voter, the bench asked, ""Why is there so much of emphasis on Aadhaar? We will not pass an order that Aadhaar is the final proof of citizenship"".Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for EC, said, ""The repeated pleadings for Aadhaar is because there are certain districts in Bihar where Aadhaar saturation is 140%"", implying large-scale prevalence of bogus identity cards.The Centre repeatedly highlighted how illegal Bangladeshi migrants and Rohingyas have managed to fraudulently obtain Aadhaar cards in some states.The bench told the political parties to activate their grassroots-level workers and booth level agents to identify people who have been wrongly deleted from the draft voters list and help them file claims before the booth level officers of Election Commission to get their names included in the final voter list.","Supreme Court rebuffed political parties' clamour for a directive to EC to accept Aadhaar card as standalone proof of citizenship.

NEW DELHI: Russia is studying potential investments plans to manufacture its Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jets in India, defence sources told ANI, amid growing bonhomie between New Delhi and Moscow.India had earlier expressed the need for at least two to three squadrons of fifth-generation fighter aircraft, with both Russia’s Su-57 and America’s F-35 in the race.Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which already builds the Russian-origin Su-30 MKI in Nashik, is seen as a possible hub for Su-57 production if the plan materialises.Russian agencies are currently assessing the level of investment required to manufacture the aircraft in India, defence sources told ANI.There are other facilities in India also where a number of other Russian origin equipment is manufactured and can be used in the fifth-generation fighter aircraft production, if required to be manufactured in India, which would also help cut costs, they added.The discussions come at a time when US President Donald Trump has targeted India with steep tariffs, 25% across sectors and an additional 25% citing Russian oil imports, while New Delhi continues to deepen ties with Moscow.In recent talks, India has sought advanced air defence systems like the S-400 and S-500 from Russia, while Moscow has been urging New Delhi to purchase Su-57 fighter jets.India was part of the Russian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft programme nearly a decade ago but later withdrew over differences.However, sources told ANI that the project could be revived given the current global scenario, even as the US continues to push its F-35 offer to India.Meanwhile, India is simultaneously developing its indigenous fifth-generation fighter aircraft, expected to take its first flight by 2028 and be commissioned by 2035.","Russia is studying potential investments plans to manufacture its Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jets in India, defence sources told ANI.

NEW DELHI: Kannada actor Ranya Rao has been imposed with a fine of Rs 102 crore in the gold smuggling case, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said. Along with her, three others were also imposed a fine of over Rs 50 crore. The DRI officials on Tuesday served the penalty notice running 2,500 pages to the actor and others presently in the Bengaluru Central Jail.She was caught with 14.8 kg of gold on March 3 at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on her arrival from Dubai.Rao and others were served the notice inside the jail and they were also warned that if they don't pay the fine, their properties could be attached.The Ranya Rao case became a high-profile one as her stepfather is senior IPS officer Dr K Ramachandra Rao. He was sent on leave after the smuggling case surfaced. It was revoked later.Investigations revealed that Ranya Rao made frequent trips to Dubai (up to 52 between 2023 and early 2025) and allegedly used police escorts to avoid customs screenings. Gold jewellery worth Rs 2 crore and cash totalling Rs 2.67 crore were also recovered from her residence. Rao alleged severe maltreatment in DRI custody, claiming she was slapped multiple times (10–15 times), denied food and sleep, and coerced into signing voluminous documents, including blank pages.Following Rao's arrest, her husband Jatin Hukkeri came on the radar. Hukkeri sought legal relief by applying for exemption from arrest, citing that they had separated about a month after their marriage, around December 2024 -- highlighting that they were living apart at the time the case unfolded. The Karnataka High Court granted temporary protection, preventing any immediate action against him until the next hearing.","Rao was caught with 14.8 kg of gold on March 3 at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on her arrival from Dubai.

Trump ‘Sold Out India For Pakistan Business Deals,’ Says Ex-U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan

WASHINGTON: A key architect of close US-India engagement accused President Donald Trump of wrecking ties with New Delhi because of family business interests in Pakistan amid a visible rift between the White House and administration mandarins on India and the tariff issue.Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who has served under President Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton over the past decade and whose remit included India ties, told the podcast Meidastouch on Monday that Trump has ""thrown the India relationship over the side"" because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family.Sullivan was referring to Trump family ties to Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which signed a deal with the Pakistan Crypto Council in April of 2025, to advance crypto development and digital financial transformation in Pakistan. Members of the Trump family, including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, are reported to hold significant stake in the company.Witkoff is the son of Steve Witkoff, a former real estate lawyer whose friendship with Trump goes back to the 1980s and who is now his troubleshooter in hotspots across the world, including in the Gulf and Russia-Ukraine. The crypto deal is believed to have resulted in Trump inviting Pakistan's military ruler Asim Munir to the White House, weeks after Zach Witkoff met him in Islamabad to promote his crypto venture.Calling it ""one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy,"" Sullivan said jettisoning ties with India is a ""huge strategic harm,"" and warned it would cause allies like Germany, Japan, and Canada to hedge their bets because the US could not be trusted and they could be next.""Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts...it has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world,"" he said.Sullivan's remarks came even as Trump administration mandarins appeared to be dialing down the White House invective against India amid wide coverage in the US media of the SCO summit in China. Many pundits lamented that Trump's hardball approach was driving New Delhi to closer ties with Moscow and Beijing in what some characterized as a new ""axis of upheaval.""But US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made light of the SCO meeting, calling it ""largely performative,"" and maintaining that India's values are much closer to America's that to China's or Russia's. “The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine. But at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved,” Bessent said.White House trade counselor Peter Navarro too appeared to dial down his diatribe against India, saying, with reference to the SCO summit in Tianjin, ""It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed with Xi Jinping and Putin... We hope he comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us and not Russia.""But many analysts reckon the damage is done and it will be tough to retrieve the relationship. ""Even if India and U.S. eventually reach a tariff deal, the trust is most likely gone,"" Ed Price, a senior non-resident fellow at New York University told CNBC, amid alarm in the US commentariat at what is seen as monumental missteps by Trump.""If the Chinese, the Russians, and Indians get together in any form of alliance that is economic and around the edges military, there's no way that the Americans can compete in the 21st Century. We might as well go home,"" Price said.","Ex-U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan says Trump has ""thrown the India relationship over the side"" because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family.

Who are Kavitha's cousins and what did she say?



Kavitha was removed from Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham in August



No Raksha-Bandhan between Kavitha KTR this year



Kavitha's six-page letter to KCR in May



Liquor scam and Kavitha's arrest



NEW DELHI: Former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao suspended his daughter K Kavitha from the BRS days after she spoke up against her cousin and former minister Harish Rao for tarnishing her father's image. ""The party leadership is taking this matter seriously as the recent behaviour and ongoing anti-party activities of party MLC K Kavitha are damaging the BRS party. Party President K. Chandrasekhar Rao has taken a decision to suspend K Kavitha from the party with immediate effect,"" BRS posted on X.The immediate reason for the expulsion is Kavitha's recent statements against her cousins, T Harish Rao and Santosh Kumar. Kavitha said they have a tacit understanding with chief minister Revanth Reddy to defame her father as the Revanth Reddy government decided to order a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the Kaleshwaram project, which was built during the BRS regime.""We (BRS cadre) have to think why the taint of corruption came to KCR. Some who are close to KCR have benefited in many ways by making use of his name. KCR's name is getting defamed today because of their misdeeds.How can the party move ahead if the same persons are encouraged,"" Kavitha said.""Did Harish Rao, who was irrigation minister for five years, not have a major role in this? That's why KCR sidelined him (Harish Rao) in the second term (in power). Two, three persons are responsible for the taint on KCR in the whole episode of Kaleshwaram, While Harish Rao is one, former Rajya Sabha member (Santosh Kumar) is another,"" she said.But the rift goes a long way as Kavitha was being cornered in the party and her actions were held responsible for this.Weeks before, Kavitha was removed as honorary president of the Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham. Kavitha said it was a political conspiracy as the internal crisis was deepening.Kavitha has been openly speaking out against her party and raised questions over the handling of internal matters.According to reports, this was the first year that Kavitha skipped the Raksha Bandhan celebration. When she was asked before the occasion if she would tie a rakhi to KTR, her only brother, she said she would. But later, Kavitah disclosed that she was told that KTR was not in Bengaluru and not in Hyderabad.As Kavitha started the second innings of her political career, after taking a break as she got bail last year, she became vocal -- against her own party. In May, she wrote a six-page letter to father, and said KCR, of late, was lacking force. Kavitha criticised KCR's speech on the occasion of the party's silver jubilee and pointed out that the former chief minister omitted several key issues and his oratory was missing.Kavitha was arrested by the ED in March 2024 in the liquor scam case. Kavitha was part of the alleged South cartel in the scam, as the ED alleged that Kavitha conspired with Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia to influence the formulation and execution of the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22. In return, she is accused of arranging ₹100 crore in kickbacks for them.In August 2024, Kavitha was granted bail.Daughter of KCR, sister of KT Rama Rao, K Kavitha was born in Karimnagar and studied in Hyderabad. Kavitha studied B Tech. in Computer Science from VNRVJIET and an MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern Mississippi. After returning to India, she took her political plunge and was a key figure in the Telangana statehood movement alongside her father. Kavitha was elected the MP from Nizamabad in 2014, becoming the first woman MP of the TRS (now BRS). In 2019, she lost the election but was elected as an MLC from Nizamabad.","Former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao suspended his daughter K Kavitha from the BRS.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding.

"Cheque bounce convict can make deal, avoid jail: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cheque-bounce-convict-can-make-deal-avoid-jail-sc/articleshow/123666289.cms,"NEW DELHI: A person can avoid a jail term after being convicted in a cheque bounce case if they reach a compromise with the complainant, Supreme Court said on Tuesday, holding that once a compromise deed is signed between the parties, conviction under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act cannot be sustained.A bench of justices Aravind Kumar and Sandeep Mehta said the offence of dishonour of cheque was mainly a civil wrong and had been made specifically compoundable. ""This court referred the offence under Section 138 NI Act as a Civil Sheep in Criminal Wolf's Clothing which meant issues agitated by the parties under the said provision are of private nature which are brought within the sweep of criminality jurisdiction in order to strengthen the credibility of the negotiable instruments,"" the bench said while referring to an earlier verdict of the SC.The court set aside a Punjab and Haryana HC ruling that had refused to quash conviction in a cheque dishonour case after settlement between the parties.SC said when parties enter into an agreement and compound the offence, they do so to save themselves from the process of litigation, allows them to do so. Hence, courts cannot override such compounding and impose its will, it said.""Once the complainant has signed the compromise deed accepting the amount in full and final settlement of the default sum the proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act cannot hold water; therefore, the concurrent conviction rendered by the Courts below has to be set aside,"" the bench said.""Therefore, it is very clear that although dishonour of cheque entails criminal consequence, the legislature by virtue of section 147 of the NI Act has made it compoundable notwithstanding the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the same can be compounded at any stage of the proceedings especially when the parties have themselves arrived at a voluntary compromise,"" it said.","A person can avoid a jail term after being convicted in a cheque bounce case if they reach a compromise with the complainant, Supreme Court says.

Supreme Court raised this question while wondering whether the death of a man, who died in similar circumstances, was really a case of suicide as alleged by the prosecution or one of murder.Hearing a plea against anticipatory bail granted to an accused who is facing an abetment of suicide charge, a bench of justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan sought Madhya Pradesh govt's response on whether the case was probed from all angles, raising doubts on the police report that it was a case of suicide.""To our understanding, whether a person would be able to use a rifle to shoot himself on the chest needs examination. In such circumstances, we deem it appropriate to require the state to file an affidavit whether the investigating agency has investigated all aspects of the matter including possibility of a murder,"" the bench said.As per the prosecution, the deceased died by suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a rifle. Relying on the prosecution's version, the high court granted anticipatory bail to the accused under IPC Section 306 . ""Such affidavit shall be filed within a period of two weeks.

"If we can clear delayed bills, why not perform other guv functions: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-we-can-clear-delayed-bills-why-not-perform-other-guv-functions-sc/articleshow/123664421.cms,"Singhvi: Keeping bills pending without any reason by guv is distortion of constitutional scheme of governance

NEW DELHI: In a sharp reaction to Tamil Nadu's defence of Supreme Court granting deemed assent to bills delayed by governors, a five-judge apex court bench on Tuesday asked - ""if we can do this, why can't we step into the governor's shoes to order a bill's return to the legislature and also reserve it for President's consideration?""For TN, senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar that given the numerous instances of governors in states sitting over bills indefinitely to subvert the spirit of paramountcy of people which undergirds the Constitution, the apex court should lay down a general timeline for all governors on taking decision on bills.CJI Gavai and Justice Nath asked, “If governors do not comply with the SC-fixed timeline, what would be the consequence?”Singhvi said then SC should make a provision for deemed assent — to consider the bill to have been assented to — to avoid exercising contempt of court powers.Cautioning that Singhvi’s argument can have dangerous implications, Justice Nath told the senior lawyer that Article 200 gives four options to a governor — to grant assent to a bill, withhold assent, return it to legislature with suggestions, and reserve it for President’s consideration.“If SC can grant deemed assent to long-pending bills, what prevents it from stepping into a governor’s shoes to exercise the options,” he asked.Singhvi, however, pressed on and sought to justify his arguments by saying that keeping bills pending without any reason by a governor is a distortion of the constitutional scheme of governance and is being repeated state after state.“SC judges are not sitting in ivory towers. They know the ground reality.When bills are kept pending for years and when the governor’s action cannot be questioned in a constitutional court, then the governor arrogates himself with unfettered power to kill a bill, and with it the will of the people, by simply keeping it pending. He, thus, becomes a super CM with a pocket veto, and the elected govt would be a mere bystander,” he said.Singhvi argued that SC has time and again fixed timelines for speakers to decide pending petitions seeking disqualification of MLAs under the Tenth Schedule.CJI Gavai said, “In the Telangana case, it was Singhvi who had argued that SC cannot fix a timeline for speakers. We rejected that argument and asked the speaker, who acts as a tribunal in dealing with petitions under the anti-defection law, to decide it within three months.”Recalling the July 31 judgment authored by him, CJI Gavai said, “Yet, we did not fix a general timeline for all speakers to decide such cases. We left it to Parliament to consider whether the mechanism of entrusting speakers with the important task of deciding the issue of disqualification on the ground of defection is serving the purpose of effectively combating political defection or not?”When senior advocate Singhvi proceeded to cite examples of governors sitting over the bills for years, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “If he wants to give such examples it will be taking a dirty path. I have no objection and I am ready to charter that path also. I will file an affidavit showing how the Constitution was taken on a joy ride since Independence. Do we want to go that path?”The CJI-led bench said, “We will not be guided by what governors did in individual states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Karnataka. We will deal with the Presidential Reference constitutionally and answer the queries on their own merit.”The arguments will continue Wednesday.","A five-judge apex court bench asked - ""if we can do this, why can't we step into the governor's shoes to order a bill's return to the legislature and also reserve it for President's consideration?""

Cops arrested three men from Punjab and one from Kashmir in this connection, SSP Shobhit Saxena said at a press conference on Tuesday.On July 29, police received information about a narcotics consignment being drone-dropped in Chhan Tanda village near the international border in Kathua’s Hiranagar sector. Acting swiftly, a joint team of cops and BSF seized approximately 447g of opium. Hiranagar PS filed a case under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and launched a probe.During the investigation, police arrested two drug couriers — Punjab natives Sukhwinder Singh (Amritsar) and Arshdeep Singh (Gurdaspur) — tasked with collecting the drone-dropped drug packages and supplying them to traffickers. The duo was employed in an NHAI project in Samba’s Ghagwal, the SSP said.Their arrest led to the recovery of 411g of heroin meant to be supplied to traffickers at the next available opportunity, Saxena said.Police subsequently arrested the receiver, Feroz Din of Kathua’s Rajbagh, and found that he had been in touch with a Pakistan-based drug smuggler.Further questioning of the accused led cops to a drug kingpin and financier from Punjab’s Tarn Taran. “He was also in touch with the same Pakistan-based smuggler and was responsible for sending the proceeds of narcotics sale to Pakistan via hawala channels,” said the SSP, adding that cops seized heroin and cash from Feroz Din as well as the drug kingpin.Investigations revealed that the accused had already supplied over 30kg of heroin that had been air-dropped via drones into Punjab and J&K and circulated by drug peddlers in adjoining districts. “They ran a sophisticated syndicate, taking all precautions to evade law enforcement. Further investigation is underway, and more recovery and arrests are expected in the coming days,” SSP Saxena said.In a separate case, Kathua Police arrested two suspects — Murad Ali and Bagh Hussain — with cash and heroin earlier in July, the SSP said. Based on their statements, cops arrested three more men and seized 20g of heroin from the trio.","Kathua Police busted interstate drug trafficking syndicate involved in collecting air-dropped narcotics consignments from Pakistan via drones.

The Yamuna river, swollen after receiving an inflow of over 3.4 lakh cusecs of water on Monday, has started causing visible impact in several villages of Yamunanagar district. Although the water in Yamuna river receded as it was recorded over 1.63 lakh cusecs at 9 am and 1.42 lakh cusecs at 6 pm at Hathnikund Barrage on Tuesday.Authorities fear major damage in case of a further rise in water levels, as riverbank erosion has already begun in vulnerable areas.Yamunanagar deputy commissioner (DC) Parth Gupta, superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal, and Irrigation Department Superintendent Engineer R S Mittal, along with other senior officials, visited the flood-affected villages of Tapu Kamalpur and Pobari to review the situation. In Tapu Kamalpur, the Yamuna is now flowing just 200 meters away from the village. Although preventive efforts are underway, continuous erosion remains a serious threat.“Last year, nearly 80% of the population of this village had to migrate when the situation worsened. This time, around Rs 7 crore has been spent to install studs over a two-kilometer stretch, which has helped reduce some risk. Still, danger persists,” said villagers during the officials’ visit.DC Gupta informed that after two days of heavy rainfall, the Yamuna had swollen with 3.4 lakh cusecs of water, though the flow reduced to 1.4 lakh cusecs by Tuesday. “At present, floodwater has not entered residential areas. Soil bags are being placed to check erosion, and announcements are being made in over 125 adjoining villages urging people to stay away from the Yamuna. Officers have been deployed in affected areas for relief and safety measures,” he said.He also confirmed an unfortunate incident in which two youths drowned while attempting to collect logs washed down from the mountains into the river. “We appeal to people not to go near the Yamuna, as it is extremely dangerous. The administration is fully alert, and disaster management measures have been activated in view of the weather department’s warnings,” Gupta added.SP Kamaldeep Goyal stated that all police station heads have been directed to stay stationed in vulnerable areas and coordinate with village sarpanches to ensure preparedness. “The underpass at Kalanaur has been closed due to waterlogging. Police teams are making rounds in villages near the river, advising people to remain cautious,” he said.With around 125 villages located along the Yamuna’s course in Yamunanagar, the administration is on high alert to prevent loss of life and property. Relief efforts continue, even as search operations are underway to trace the two missing youths.To strengthen preparedness, a district-level flood control room has been set up at the secretariat. Citizens can report emergencies or seek assistance at 01732-237801. Additional control rooms have also been established across subdivisions - Radaur SDM office – 01732-283899, Vyaspur BDPO office – 01735-297588, Chhachhrauli SDM office – 01735-293400, Yamunanagar Jagadhri Municipal Corporation – 01732-237841/9810336887 and Hathnikund Barrage and river water level updates – 01732-237837.On this occasion, Jagadhri SDM Vishwanath, Radaur SDM Narendra Kumar, superintending engineer of irrigation Ravi Shankar Mittal, District Revenue Officer Tarun Sahota, DDPO Narendra Singh, BDPO Shyam Lal, Executive Engineer Vinod Kumar, and local panchayat representatives.","After two days of heavy rainfall, the Yamuna had swollen with 3.4 lakh cusecs of water, though the flow reduced to 1.4 crore by Tuesday.

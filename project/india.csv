NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was paraded through the streets of Nagpur on Saturday as part of the Marbat festival, with locals using the celebration to protest against the 50% tariffs recently imposed on Indian imports.Visuals from the procession showed residents chanting slogans, holding placards and wheeling the towering Trump figure through the city. “Tariff lagakar humein jo daraye, Bharat ki takat usse rulaye (Those who try to intimidate us with tariffs, India’s strength will make them weep),” read one placard. Another protester said, “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business.”Some participants carried placards accusing Washington of hypocrisy, one of which read, “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The effigy, built with clay and hay, wore a dark red suit, white shirt and yellow tie, and was decorated with marigold garlands and posters. At one point, it was spun in circles and brought face to face with another effigy, drawing cheers from the crowd.The Marbat festival, which dates back to the late 1800s, is an annual Nagpur tradition where locals parade effigies to symbolically drive out evil and highlight contemporary political, social and economic issues.Over time, it has evolved into a blend of protest, satire and entertainment.Trump announced a 25% reciprocal tariff against India in early August after trade talks failed, followed by another 25% levy to be enforced later this month over India’s continued purchase of Russian oil during the Ukraine war. India has strongly opposed the measures, calling them “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while signalling it will maintain energy ties with Moscow.“If you have a problem with India buying oil or refined products from Russia, don’t buy from us. Nobody forces you. Europe buys, America buys, so if you don’t like it, don’t buy it,” India responded.(With inputs from agencies)","A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was paraded through the streets of Nagpur on Saturday.

Uttarkashi Cloudburst Horror: Flash Floods Sweep Away Village, People Seen Running For Their Lives

DEHRADUN/HALDWANI/ALMORA/RUDRAPUR: In Uttarakhand, each monsoon brings devastation-roads wash away, homes collapse, and there is widespread destruction. This year, the monsoons have been particularly harsh, as the disasters at Dharali, Tharali, Harsil and Syanachatti show. Amid this annual havoc, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling govt schools despite crores being sanctioned for repairs year after year. Most recently, a tranche of Rs 20 crore was released for this purpose, yet the reality on the ground remains bleak.For many children, the classroom has become less a place of learning and more a daily struggle for safety-amid collapsing walls, leaking roofs, and the threat of wild animals straying in. Education minister Dhan Singh Rawat, taking cognisance of the issue, recently directed repairs to be completed by March 2026, allotting Rs 2 crore each to seven districts and Rs 1 crore each to the rest six. But state-watchers say this is nowhere close to what's required and the estimated cost for repairs exceeds Rs 72 crore. ""We've received proposals from nearly 1,400 schools. We are sending the remaining demand to the govt.Repairing these schools and ensuring safety is a priority,"" said Mukul Sati, director of secondary education.In Dehradun, officials admit that 227 primary and 44 secondary schools require urgent repair. In Sinyali, the boundary wall of a school was washed away in heavy rain, leaving the premises exposed. In Chukkhuwala, parents have been raising alarm about their local intercollege. ""The ceiling here has cracks. Each downpour weakens it further. We worry for our children's safety,"" said Amit Verma, a parent.In Udham Singh Nagar, 55 schools have officially been declared dilapidated. In Kashipur block, nine schools shifted classes to anganwadi centres and makeshift premises after rainwater poured through cracked roofs and walls. In Jaspur's Rajkiya Primary School, nearly three feet of water flooded the campus during a recent spell of rain, forcing children to wade through water to reach classrooms. A primary school in Maldevta, on the outskirts of Doon, damaged in the 2022 tragedy, is yet to see repairs.(Inputs by Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun, Sonali Mishra in Haldwani, Aakash Ahuja in US Nagar, and Yogesh Nagarkoti in Almora)","In Uttarakhand, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling govt schools.

In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day. The sole purpose of this day is to honor the ancestors or forefathers. Every month, Amavasya falls, and this may be determined using Daily Hindu Panchang.Amavasya days are regarded as unlucky for carrying out any auspicious rituals, including Griha Pravesh, Mundan, Marriages, and Engagements. However, Amavasya days are seen as auspicious for carrying out religious rites including bathing in the holy Ganga, conducting hawan, feeding Brahmins, participating in charitable activities, and offer prayers to ancestors by performing Pitru Tarpan, Pitru Puja, and Pind Daan.Among the most well-known Amavasya celebrations in Hinduism are Mauni Amavasya, Somvati Amavasya, Shanichari Amavasya, Kartik Amavasya, Mahalaya Amavasya or Sarva Pitri Amavasya, Hariyali Amavasya, and Vat Amavasya.Since this day is dedicated to the Moon and the Moon is in its waning phase, which is unlucky for people with the Moon positioned poorly in their natal birth chart, astrology does not view it as a powerful day.Therefore, we are providing some remedies to help you eliminate the negative effects of the Moon.In addition to doing different religious activities, such as performing hawan dedicated to ancestors, one must perform remedies linked to Saturn on Amavasya day.Your mood, feelings, and emotions will be greatly impacted, and the impact will be significantly greater, if the Moon is in an unfavorable position in your natal birth chart. Since you won't feel well or have much energy on this particular day, you should offer water to the moon in the evening after sighting the Moon and worship Lord Shiva as well, since only Lord Shiva can protect you from the negative effects of Moon.","In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day.

Poll What should be the priority for international agencies in combating terror financing? Stricter monitoring of fund flows Stronger global cooperation

NEW DELHI: After suffering severe setbacks during Operation Sindoor , Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit has launched a massive fundraising drive in that country under the garb of building over 300 mosques to replicate Lashkar-e-Taiba’s decentralization policy, security officials said.The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds.It is using digital wallets like ‘EasyPaisa’ and ‘Sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar ’s family members to bypass scrutiny by global agencies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the officials said citing inputs from across the border.The Rs 3.91 billion fundraising drive would secure JeM’s operational and weapons financing for at least a decade, they said.Indian armed forces carried out missile strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7 in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack Pakistan retaliated and the intense border skirmishes continued till May 10 before the two countries reached an understanding to end the hostilities.The officials said the JeM’s headquarters ‘Markaz Subhanallah’, along with four other training camps -- Markaz Bilal, Markaz Abbas, Mahmona Joya, and the Sargal training camp – were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor.While Pakistan’s government has announced funding to rebuild these destroyed facilities, the JeM has launched an online fundraising campaign through digital wallets to collect Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new markaz buildings under the garb of constructing mosques across Pakistan, the officials said.On social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, JeM-linked proxy accounts and those used by JeM commanders have posted posters, videos, and a letter from Masood Azhar, urging supporters to donate wholeheartedly as each mosque requires Rs 12.5 million (Rs 1.25 crore) for construction and smooth running, they said.According to the officials, several of the digital wallet accounts were found linked to the mobile number of Azhar’s brother Talha Al Saif (Talha Gulzar) and JeM Haripur district commander Aftab Ahmad based in Khala Batt Township.They said another fundraising channel was linked to a mobile number run by Azhar’s son Abdullah Azhar (Abdullah Khan) while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, JeM commander Syed Safdar Shah is collecting donations for the organization’s markaz via a number registered near Melwarah post office, Oghi, Mansehra district. In addition to these three accounts, over 250 EasyPaisa wallets are reportedly being used to raise funds for the JeM’s fundraising campaign.Alongside social media appeals, the terror outfit circulated an audio recording of Azhar’s brother, Al Saif, via its official propaganda channel, MSTD Official, urging supporters to contribute Rs 21,000 per person, the officials said. The speech was delivered at a gathering at Markaz Usman-o-Ali during a Friday congregation on August 15.In the audio clip, Al Saif also instructed the establishment of 20 new markaz this year, as part of JeM’s overall target of 313 centres, the officials said citing JeM’s organizational posters and videos. To build these mosques, the officials said the JeM may have two key motives -- first, to replicate LeT’s vast markaz network, decentralising its training camps so that future Indian strikes would have minimal impact on its terror infrastructure in Pakistan.Second, to establish secure, lavish safe houses for Azhar and his family to allow Pakistan to maintain plausible deniability about their whereabouts, the officials said. Under this plan, three-four large markaz centres would function as safe houses, medium-sized facilities would serve as training camps, and the remainder would handle logistics, allowing JeM to operate nationwide while Pakistan’s government continues to deny Azhar’s presence, they said.While JeM claims each markaz will cost Rs 12.5 million, estimates suggest a Markaz Bilal-sized facility costs only Rs 4-5 million.Larger markaz like Subhanallah or Usman-o-Ali may cost around Rs 100 million, but it is unlikely all 313 will be this large. If built, with three large markaz and 310 smaller ones, the total construction cost would be about Rs 1.23 billion (Rs 123 crore) leaving a large surplus for weapons purchases, the officials said.Given JeM-Hamas-TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) connections and leadership meetings, the officials said the surplus could be used to acquire advanced weaponry and maybe attack drones or quadcopters used by TTP.It is widely known that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI helps JeM procure arms cheaply from the black market, the officials said. “Today, JeM’s arsenal already includes machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars.Thus this Rs 3.91 billion campaign could heavily bolster its arms stockpile,” an official said. In 2019, Pakistan was placed in grey list by the international watchdog working on blocking terror financing and accordingly, the Pakistani Government implemented the National Action Plan and presented to FATF that it had curbed JeM by taking its markaz under government control and placing JeM chief and his brother’s bank accounts under official watch, the officials said.It also banned cash transactions, animal hide donations, and other forms of fundraising which resulted in Pakistan getting formally removed from FATF’s grey list in 2022. Now, instead of donations going into bank accounts, the money is being transferred to the digital wallets used by Azhar’s family members and this way, Pakistan could falsely claim to FATF by showing only bank account details that JeM’s funding had been cut off, the officials said.",The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds.

NEW DELHI: After a delay of more than six months, the Centre has approved negotiations for building six advanced submarines in India with German collaboration under Project 75 India.According to defence officials quoted by ANI, the defence ministry and state-owned Mazagaon Dockyards Limited (MDL) have been given clearance to begin talks with German firm ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Negotiations are expected to start by the end of this month, with the contract likely to be finalised within six months.The decision followed a high-level meeting involving top defence and national security officials who reviewed India’s submarine programme and future fleet requirements. The proposed submarines will feature Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems, enabling them to remain submerged for up to three weeks, a significant capability boost for the Indian Navy Officials said the project aims not just to expand the submarine fleet but also to strengthen indigenous capability in designing and manufacturing conventional submarines. The move comes as India faces the twin challenge of modernising its fleet and countering rapid naval expansion by China and Pakistan.The Navy plans to replace about 10 ageing submarines over the next decade. In parallel, India is also pursuing nuclear submarine projects, with private sector major Larsen & Toubro working alongside the Submarine Building Centre to develop two nuclear attack submarines.With Project 75 India, the government is looking to accelerate submarine production and ensure the Navy’s operational readiness in the Indian Ocean region.","Centre gives clearance to defence ministry, MDL to begin negotiations for Rs 70,000 crore submarine deal.

It seems like a conspiracy to harass and intimidate people,” LAB representatives said at a press conference in Leh. “Sonam Wangchuk is very vocal about the rights of the people of Ladakh at national and international level. We see this as an attempt to silence the voices of Ladakh one by one. But we will not be scared. All leadership stands with him.”Wangchuk, on his part, termed the administration’s move as an attack on Ladakh itself. “It is not an attack on Sonam Wangchuk, but on Ladakh. It is an attack on the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance,” he said.LAB and KDA, formed in 2020, represent political and religious groups from Leh and Kargil. Both have been demanding statehood for Ladakh and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Since the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of the J&K state into the two UTs — J&K and Ladakh — the Ladakh region has witnessed a series of political agitations for the Sixth Schedule and statehood.Wangchuk has led several such protests, holding long fasts and long marches.On Jan 2, 2023, the ministry of home affairs set up a high-powered committee to address key issues in Ladakh, including the Sixth Schedule. The last round of talks, between the Centre’s high-powered committee and the Ladakhi leaders was held on May 27, leading to the introduction of a domicile policy.On Aug 11, LAB and KDA launched a three-day protest in Kargil, led by Wangchuk, demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.On Aug 21, Leh deputy commissioner Romil Singh Donk issued an order stating that the land measuring 1,076 kanal and 1 marla (over 53.8 hectares) allotted to HIAL “stands escheated to the State, i.e., LAHDC (Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council)”, and directed the Leh tehsildar to “remove all the encumbrances from the said piece of state land as per provisions of the law, and effect entries in the revenue record accordingly”.The order said the land in Phyang was given to HIAL on lease for 40 years, but it has not been used for the purpose allotted, “as no university (as recognised by law) has been set up” to date.Wangchuk, while talking to reporters, said HIAL was created in 2018 with the support of Ladakh leaders after the success of the “ice stupa” project, which was aimed at addressing Ladakh’s water crisis. “The land was leased to the HIAL under unanimous consensus of Ladakhi leaders. It is a charitable company, not my personal university,” Wangchuk said. “The allotment was given in 2018, and now, suddenly, the Ladakh administration says it is not serving its purpose. ”He said 400 students have passed out from HIAL. “The cancellation of the land lease at this juncture, when Ladakhi leaders are seeking safeguards for the region, shows a design. HIAL is the pride of not just Ladakh but of the whole Himalayas,” he added.",Ladakh administration cancels land allotment of Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning.

The relentless downpour has prompted swift action from the Army and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who have been actively conducting relief operations in Kota.Meanwhile, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) has been evacuating residents from other severely affected areas, ensuring their safety amidst the rising waters.In a bid to assess the extent of the damage and coordinate further relief efforts, Disaster Relief Minister Kirodi Meena, accompanied by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, is set to conduct an aerial survey of the affected regions in the Kota division on Saturday.Their visit underscores the gravity of the situation and the government's commitment to addressing the crisis. The Meteorological Department has reported that Bundi's Nainwa received an unprecedented 502 mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, marking it as the highest in the region.This deluge has led to significant waterlogging in several districts, including Bundi, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, and Jaipur, with rainfall exceeding 10 cm by Saturday morning. In response to the ongoing threat, a red alert has been issued for Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, warning of extremely heavy rainfall, while an orange alert remains in place for Bundi, Kota, Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Jalore, and Sirohi.In Tonk district, the SDRF and civil defense teams have successfully rescued over 100 individuals from a village in Niwai’s Banasthali, which was submerged under water.

NEW DELHI: The department of posts on Saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the United States, effective August 25, 2025, in response to major regulatory changes introduced by the US government that impact the international shipping of goods.As per the statement issued by the government, this decision follows the issuance of Executive Order No. 14324 by the US administration on July 30, 2025, which withdraws the duty-free de minimis exemption for goods valued up to USD 800, a threshold that previously allowed low-value goods to enter the US without customs duties.Beginning August 29, 2025, all goods sent to the US, regardless of their value, will be subject to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.Gift items valued up to USD 100 will remain exempt from these new duties, according to the executive order.The executive order also outlines new responsibilities for transport carriers and “qualified parties” authorized by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). These entities are now required to collect and remit duties on international postal shipments.Although CBP released initial guidelines on August 15, 2025, critical implementation details, such as the process for designating “qualified parties” and systems for collecting and remitting duties, have not yet been finalized.Due to these unresolved issues, air carriers handling US-bound international mail have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25 citing lack of technical and operational preparedness to comply with the new requirements.As a result, the Department of Posts will suspend the booking of all categories of international postal articles destined for the US with effect from August 25 except for the following:These exempted categories will continue to be accepted and transported to the US, subject to further clarifications from CBP and the United States Postal Service (USPS).The department is in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders and is actively monitoring developments. Efforts are being made to resume full postal operations to the US as soon as possible, as per a PIB release.Customers who have already booked items that are no longer eligible for dispatch under the new conditions may apply for a refund of postage.The department expressed regret for the inconvenience caused and reaffirmed its commitment to restoring full service at the earliest opportunity.","The department of posts on Saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the United States, effective August 25, 2025.

"Despite opposition, J&K government assumes control of 215 Jamaat-linked schools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-opposition-jk-government-assumes-control-of-215-jamaat-linked-schools/articleshow/123477366.cms,"A security official stands guard outside a school at Wanabal Rawalpora, in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.

J&K High Court Orders Modi Govt To Bring Back Woman Deported To Pakistan After Pahalgam Attack

SRINAGAR: A day after ordering the takeover of schools allegedly run by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami’s (JeI) educational organisation, Falah-e-Aam Trust (FAT), Jammu and Kashmir government moved swiftly on Saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except BJP. A senior official said the principals of nearby government schools, backed by police and revenue staff, asserted administrative authority in all 215 JeI-linked schools across Kashmir.On Friday evening, J&K education secretary stated in its order directing the takeover that 215 schools had been identified by “intelligence agencies” that were “found to be directly or indirectly affiliated with proscribed organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (Jel)”.Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti condemned the decision, saying Kashmiris voted the National Conference (NC) to office in the 2024 assembly elections to safeguard their interests, but the party has instead targeted schools that provided quality education in J&K.Her daughter Iltija Mufti said every time NC got a brute majority in J&K, their first target has always been the Jamaat-e-Islami. “Be it 1977 or even today, where they have taken it too far by jeopardising the future of thousands of students, leaving them in distress,” she said.Education minister Sakina Itoo defended the decision, saying the state had not taken over the schools but directed principals of nearby govt schools to “look after” them for three months, after which the order would be reviewed. She said her proposal was altered by the administrative secretary, who inserted “deputy commissioner” and “take over” in the order instead of “nearest principal” and “look after.” The order would be corrected, she said.Administrative secretary Ram Niwas Sharma did not respond to calls for comment.I too stressed that the decision was taken to safeguard the interests of the students and teachers. Intelligence agencies had given an adverse report on these schools eight years ago, leading to their deregistration. The latest order, she said, was meant to ensure that 55,000 students of these schools continue their education and teachers remain employed.Rejecting the criticism of political opponents, she said: “Where were they all these eight years when students and teachers of these schools were suffering because of deregistration?”Responding to the minister’s statement, PDP legislator Waheed Parra challenged her to “come clean and make her original proposal public for everyone to see”. Peoples Conference, Apni Party and Awami Ittehad Party also condemned the govt move.BJP, however, welcomed the decision to assume control of Jamaat schools. Altaf Thakur, the party’s J&K spokesman, called it a “much-needed intervention to ensure that young minds are shielded from separatist narratives”. It was “a bold decision”, Thakur said, alleging that these schools were a source of “separatism and terrorism” in J&K.The central govt had banned JeI in Feb 2019 under UAPA and declared it an unlawful association. Since then, authorities have carried out several crackdowns against the group.However, in last year’s assembly elections in J&K, several candidates affiliated with JeI contested under the banner of the Justice and Development Front (JDF), indicating the group’s return to electoral politics after a 35-year poll boycott. The JDF has now aligned with Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference.","Jammu and Kashmir government moved swiftly on Saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except BJP.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was carried out at the centuries-old Marbat Utsav in Nagpur, as locals symbolically protested the US government’s recent 50% tariff on Indian goods.Alongside the giant effigy, several placards carried protest messages such as: “By imposing tariffs to intimidate us, they end up regretting India’s strength,"" “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business” and “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The Marbat festival, celebrated annually in Nagpur on the second day of Pola, blends tradition, culture and social commentary.Originating in the 19th century, the festival was initially intended to ward off evil spirits, with clay and hay effigies known as “Marbats” that represented negative forces or societal evils. Over time, the event has evolved into a platform for expressing public sentiment on contemporary social and political issues.This year, the Trump effigy was carried, reflecting public displeasure over the tariff imposed by the US.On August 6, President Trump signed an executive order adding a 25% tariff on Indian goods to the existing 25% rate, citing India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, a significant funding source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.The festival processions, vibrant music and ritualistic burning or immersion of effigies offered residents a means to voice their discontent while maintaining the cultural essence of Marbat Utsav. Traditionally, the effigies symbolize corruption, injustice or social evils, according to the website of Maharashtra tourism.","A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was carried out at the centuries-old Marbat Utsav in Nagpur. locals symbolically protested the US government’s recent 50% tariff on Indian goods.

"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

NEW DELHI: On the country’s second National Space Day, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that India has already reached the Moon and Mars, and now it is time we “must explore deeper regions of space”. Emphasising that these unexplored areas hold vital secrets for the future of humanity, the PM announced, “Beyond galaxies lies our horizon!”“India is rapidly advancing in breakthrough technologies such as semi-cryogenic engines and electric propulsion, and very soon, with the dedicated efforts of our scientists, India will launch the Gaganyaan mission and, in the coming years, build its own space station,” Modi said in a special message, revealing India’s upcoming big missions. He also invited young citizens to join India’s ‘astronaut pool’ and help give flight to the country’s aspirations.The PM urged the private sector to come forward and build five space Unicorns in the next five years. “At present, we have five big launches every year; can we scale it to 50 rockets every year, that is one per week?” he asked the private sector. He also announced that the first PSLV rocket built by the private sector will soon be launched.Modi expressed happiness that India’s first private communication satellite is also under development and said preparations are underway to launch an earth observation satellite constellation through public-private partnership. “A vast number of opportunities are being created for India’s youth in the space sector,” he said.The PM highlighted that over 350 startups are emerging as engines of innovation and acceleration in space technology. India is, at present, hosting the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, with nearly 300 young participants from over sixty countries.Recalling that two years ago, India became the first country to reach the South Pole of the Moon, creating history, the PM highlighted that India has also become the fourth country in the world to possess docking-undocking capabilities in space. He shared that just three days ago, he met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, who unfurled the national flag at the International Space Station, filling every Indian with pride. He said when Group Captain Shukla showed him the tricolour, the feeling of touching it was beyond words.“Space-tech is increasingly becoming an integral part of governance in India”, Modi said citing examples such as satellite-based assessment in crop insurance schemes, satellite-enabled information and safety for fishermen, disaster management applications, and the use of geospatial data in the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. He informed that to further promote the use of space-tech across central and state governments, National Meet 2.0 was organised on Friday. He expressed his desire for such initiatives to continue and expand. He said India’s journey in space will reach new heights in the coming times.","The PM urged the private sector to come forward and build five space Unicorns in the next five years.

NEW DELHI: Space minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday revealed during National Space Day that space technology played a significant role during Operation Sindoor While mentioning the operation during which India launched missiles deep into Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack, the minister said, “A few months ago, you saw Operation Sindoor. What you saw was the full presentation of Indian space technology from Earth to space. All you saw was the energy of two key departments — the department of space and department of atomic energy. But what is more important is that these capabilities have been achieved in the last 10 years. Technology development and technology transfer happened in the last 10 years.”“Operation Sindoor gave us an opportunity to test these technologies on Pakistan soil. And, the world got to know what has happened in the last 11 years of the Modi government,” he said.Soon after the operation, Isro chairman V Narayanan had said in May, “At least 10 satellites are working 24x7 for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of the citizens of this country. Without satellite and drone tech, we cannot achieve that (operation).”Isro's satellites provide physical and navigation services for the military.Space-based navigation services of NavIC are used to guide weapons and missiles to their specific targets, Insat satellites provide weather condition information and communication services to the armed forces, Gsat services are being used for strategic communication operations and SAR satellites like Risat provide earth surveillance and observation data.While outlining Isro’s future programmes, which started in 2025 with the launch of an advanced NavIC satellite and will be followed later this year by the uncrewed Gaganyaan-1 mission with a humanoid, the minister said the two of the four astronauts will go to space as part of the manned Gaganyaan mission in 2027. “Thereafter, many more astronauts will go to space,” he said.The manned mission will be followed by Chandrayaan-4 in 2028, a mission to Venus, and the establishment of the proposed Bharat Antariksh Station by 2035. Singh said India has set its sights on placing an astronaut on the Moon by 2040, an endeavour that would symbolically mark the country’s journey towards becoming a developed nation by 2047.India plans to launch more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, and it will be a mix of govt technology missions and private sector-led operational missions, he said while releasing a roadmap for the space sector for the next 15 years.Singh said the roadmap will guide India's space journey to 2040 and beyond, supporting the vision of Viksit Bharat by leveraging space technology for food and water security, disaster resilience, environmental sustainability and inclusive growth.",Space minister Jitendra Singh said space technology played a significant role during Operation Sindoor.

The minister ruled out any compromise on the red lines drawn by India in trade negotiations and on mediation while underscoring India's position on oil that such decisions are about upholding national interest and strategic autonomy.The discussions for a bilateral trade deal could not take place as the US delegation called off its visit, but the minister said ""negotiations are still going on in the sense that nobody has said the negotiations are off"". ""People do talk to each other. It's not like there's a complete cut,"" he said, speaking at the ET World Leaders Forum. Asked about US charge that India is profiteering from Russian oil, Jaishankar said it's funny to have people who work for a pro-business American administration accusing other people of doing business. tnnThat's (US allegations that India is profiteering from Russian oil) really curious. But here's the point: if you have a problem buying oil from India - oil or refined products - don't buy it.Nobody forces you to buy it. What Europe buys, America buys. If you don't like it, don't buy it, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.""So, when it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposition to mediation, this govt is very clear.

We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it,"" he said, adding that the red lines are primarily the interests of India's farmers, and to some extent small producers.On improvement in ties with China, he said India always maintained that if the border is stable, predictable, and free of incidents, there is a natural improvement in rest of the relationship. ""The border has been stable for some time now, & as disengagement was completed, it was logical that there would be improvement in other areas... it's not a great U-turn where everything is fine now,"" he said.""For our farmers, a predictable flow of fertilisers is important. For those in infrastructure, getting machinery from China is important. For our auto industry, an uninterrupted flow of magnets is important. These are legitimate issues of our industry.

MUMBAI: Having registered a case against industrialist Anil Ambani on Thursday, CBI on Saturday carried out searches at his Cuffe Parade residence and Reliance Communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud that caused a loss of over Rs 2,929 crore to SBI.Sources said Ambani, promoter of the company, along with his wife Tina and their children, were at home when a team of CBI officials from Delhi arrived early Saturday. The searches concluded around afternoon.In its complaint to CBI, SBI had stated that the fraud came to light when a forensic auditor appointed by it submitted a report in Oct 2020, covering the examination period between April 2013 and March 2017.A spokesperson for Ambani denied the allegations and said the industrialist was ""selectively singled out"".CBI issued a press release stating that the accused persons, in criminal conspiracy, misrepresented and obtained sanctioned credit facilities from SBI in favour of Reliance Communication Ltd.By these acts, the accused persons are accused of committing offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust, the CBI press release said. Ambani will duly defend himself, his spokesperson said, adding it is an over 10-year-old matter.The SBI in its complaint said the fraud took place in Mumbai. The accused persons or company, in conspiracy with each other and unknown others, obtained credit facilities from SBI by misrepresentation and deception, it stated. After disbursal, the accused misappropriated the funds by entering into transactions in violation of terms and conditions of sanction of credit facilities. Afterwards, the loans turned NPA.The spokesperson said, ""At the relevant time, Ambani was a non-executive director of the company, with no involvement in the day-to-day management. It is pertinent to note that SBI, by its own order, has already withdrawn proceedings against five other non-executive directors. Despite this, Ambani has been selectively singled out.""In its statement , CBI said that the allegations pertain to misutilisation/diversion of loan funds, potential routing of loan funds, inter-company loan transactions, misutilisation of sales invoice financing, discounting of bills of RCom by Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL), movement of funds through inter-corporate deposits, write-off of capital advances given to Netizen Engineering Pvt Ltd (a group company of Reliance ADA Group), and creation/write-off of fictitious debtors, etc.The SBI complaint stated that in 2023, during the process of fraud identification of the account, show-cause notices were issued to the borrower and its promoters/directors to provide an opportunity for a hearing. Based on the response submitted by directors/promoters of the company, the account was classified as fraud in June 2025. While explaining the fraud, the forensic audit mentioned an instance of preference shares.On April 1, 2013, Rs 1,347.7 crore were receivable from Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) in the books of Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL). RTL issued preference shares worth Rs 1,347.7 crore to RITL in satisfaction of the receivable amount on March 31, 2014. RITL sold these shares to another related company RCTNL on the same day for Rs 260 crore, thereby incurring a loss of Rs 1,087.7 crore. RCTNL received Rs 260 crore from RTL through RCom and paid the same to RITL for purchase of preference shares of RTL.","CBI carried out searches at Anil Ambani's Cuffe Parade residence and Reliance Communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud.

Reforms are not a compulsion, nor are they crisis-driven; it is our commitment, our conviction. We take a holistic approach for each sector and undertake reforms one by one,"" he said while addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025.He listed several measures taken by the govt in recent days - from a new income tax law to Jan Vishwas Bill to decriminalise more than 300 provisions of various laws and reforms in mining and shipping sectors as well as an overhaul of the GST architecture.""A major reform is underway in GST, set to be completed by this Diwali, making it simpler and bringing down prices,"" the Prime Minister said while reasserting his promise to reduce levies.Referring to the new sports bill, the new sports policy and steps taken to host mega events, the PM said, ""It is not in my nature to be satisfied with what has already been achieved. The same approach guides our reforms... we prepare for the future.We have to move forward. We are coming with an arsenal of reforms and we are working on multiple fronts.""In a speech delivered against the backdrop of headwinds of an increasingly bellicose Trump administration and geopolitical churn and uncertainties, PM Narendra Modi conveyed calm reassurance.He said India, which had failed to grasp many opportunities before 2014, now not only grabs them when they emerge but also creates new ones. “From missing the bus to being in the driver’s seat, we’ve come a long way,” he said.The govt has unleashed a series of steps in a bid to boost domestic demand and step up economic activity at a time when US President Donald Trump’s proposed additional tariffs of 50% on India’s exports to the US could have an adverse impact on labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and leather goods. Pointing to S&P’s first sovereign rating upgrade of India in 18 years, Modi said, “This means that India, due to its resilience and strength, offers hope for the rest of the world. ” He said India was contributing to around a fifth of global growth. The PM said semiconductor-related factories have started coming up in India. “By the end of this year, the first Made-in-India chip will come in the market. We are also working on Made-in-India 6G.”“Guided by the mantra of reform, perform, transform, India today is in a position to help lift the world out of slow growth.” Although he did not make any reference to US tariffs in his address, it was seen as a rebuttal of Trump’s comments on India being a “dead economy”. “The timing of the forum is perfect, and I would like to appreciate that. Just last week, from the Red Fort I spoke about next generation reforms. Now this forum is working as the force multiplier of this spirit,” he said about the ET event.Welcoming the PM to the second edition of the ET World Leaders Forum, Satyan Gajwani, chairman of Times Internet, said Modi had refused to bow in the face of opportunistic tactics and arm-twisting when others have “agreed to play ball”. He said Operation Sindoor not only gave a fitting reply but also effected a reset in how India will respond to any such provocations in future.“We are also witnessing highly disruptive policy moves from those once deemed the global guarantors of stability. These moves threaten to upend the rules-based order that has held up the world for more than seven decades. The take-home is that the global supply chain — which ensured shared prosperity to the developed and the developing worlds — cannot be taken as a given anymore,” Gajwani said.","PM Narendra Modi said the Centre is ready to unleash an ""arsenal of reforms"" on multiple fronts, while underlining the need to be self-reliant. He listed several measures taken by the govt in recent days - from a new income tax law to Jan Vishwas Bill to decriminalise more than 300 provisions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123477688,imgsize-26920,width-400,resizemode-4/123477688.jpg"

PATNA: Diwakar Sharma remembers the past two elections clearly. His wife Deepti voted both times without trouble. Now her name has disappeared from the electoral roll, and the couple has just a week to prove she still belongs.Across Bihar, thousands are scrambling to reclaim their place on the rolls before the Sept 1 deadline - a race against time that began when SC Friday opened a narrow window for those struck off during the SIR. Voters can now submit Aadhaar or one of 11 other approved documents, even online, to restore their names. The urgency is palpable in Ara, Bhojpur, Bettiah - wherever one goes.""The BLO (booth-level officer) told me what SC has just said, but he's waiting for written orders,"" Sharma, a 35-year-old priest in West Champaran, told TOI on Saturday.On paper, the ruling offers relief. On the ground, confusion is choking the process. Many deleted voters live in remote areas with limited internet access. BLOs, the backbone of the enrolment system, said they are yet to receive ""formal instructions"" on how to act. ""We cannot consider Aadhaar until EC issues an official order,"" said a BLO from East Champaran.Suchitra Sinha, a BLO from Bhojpur, warned that the timeline is too short.""Poll authorities should extend the deadline. It is difficult to collect Aadhaar from all excluded people within a week,"" she said. Without written orders from the chief electoral officer or district officials, BLOs fear their decisions could be challenged later.Frustration runs deep over political apathy, too. Electoral rules expect parties to deputise booth-level agents to help identify excluded voters and file claims. BLOs said support is scarce.""Hardly any BLAs are taking interest in submitting forms. Some are not even aware they have been appointed,"" said M Safir Ali, a BLO in Ara. Another BLO in Ara's Babu Bazar accused parties of ""raising noise but offering no assistance"".Politicians pushed back. ""Our party submitted nine claim forms in Bhojpur district alone till Aug 23 and has been consistently drawing attention to deletions,"" said CPI(ML)'s Chandan Kumar, an aide to Ara MP Sudama Prasad. Jan Suraaj's Ashok Manav said workers were assisting in all 14 blocks, but argued it was ""the prime responsibility of election officials to ensure not a single eligible voter is disenfranchised"".The scale of deletions is staggering. West Champaran saw 1,91,376 names removed, slashing the voter count to 25,69,614 from 27,60,990. Officials say 70,000 voters had shifted residences, while 20,000 names were duplicates.For people like Sharma and trader Dhananjay Soni in Valmikinagar, whose wife Ranjana also vanished from the rolls, the SC ruling has brought hope - but little clarity. ""One week remains,"" Soni said. ""Time is running out.""(With inputs from Praveen in Ara and Dilip in Bettiah)",SC Friday opened a narrow window for those struck off during the SIR. Voters can now submit Aadhaar or one of 11 other approved documents. Many deleted voters live in remote areas with limited internet access. Electoral rules expect parties to deputise booth-level agents to help identify excluded voters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123477571,imgsize-35662,width-400,resizemode-4/123477571.jpg"

"Chasoti students, teachers vow to resume classes ‘even under tree’ day after tehravi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chasoti-students-teachers-vow-to-resume-classes-even-under-tree-day-after-tehravi/articleshow/123477423.cms,"The video, recorded hours before the flood, shows Suman Devi, 11, rehearsing ‘Dharti’ on Aug 14 for the Independence Day event — something that didn’t happen.

CHASOTI (KISHTWAR): The poem began with a warning, a child’s voice — high-pitched, but intense — carrying through the govt-run Chasoti Middle School. The video, recorded hours before the flood, shows Suman Devi, 11, rehearsing ‘Dharti’ on Aug 14 for the Independence Day event — something that didn’t happen. Among the 14 villagers swept away was Arundhati Singh, 11, who studied in Kishtwar and stayed home rather than join school preparations. As the village prepares to observe ‘tehravi’ for their dead on Tuesday, the school’s four teachers and 50 students have resolved to resume classes the day after.In the 32-second video, Suman speaks about floods that remade lives in Mandi, Dharali, Kedarnath and Katra, her finger pointed, as if addressing not just her peers but the mountain. “Hey manav, sudhar ja, iss laalach ko chhod de; dharti maa ko samaj, prakriti se rishta jod de.” (O human, mend your ways. Cast off this greed. Honour Mother Earth and restore your bond with nature.)Her cadence rises: “Warna ye prakriti nahin ruk payegi, aur tu jhulas jaayega. Vilukt hote prajati ki hai lagegi.” (Or nature will not stop; you will be scorched. The curse of the vanishing species will descend, again and again upon you.)And then the final one, unblinking: “Phir tera number aayega. Tu bhi vilukt ho jaayega.” (Then it will be your turn. You, too, will vanish.)The morning of Aug 14 had been ordinary. Children were preparing for Independence Day skits — one group staging Operation Sindoor, others playing freedom fighters and soldiers. Bhagat Singh, British officers, soldiers, terrorists moved on cue, while Suman prepared her poem.Chasoti Middle School, 15 metres from the torrent’s path, has remained standing. Inside, everyone survived. That survival owed itself to timing. As it was a long break for Independence Day, Janmashtami and Rakshabandhan, children from Chasoti who study in other towns had returned home and were also called in to help prepare for the event. Arundhati was the only one who did not come.Every family in Chasoti was bereaved — a sibling gone, a grandparent lost, an aunt cremated, cousin missing. Each of the school’s four teachers carries grief. Hukam Chand Rathore, 45, the head teacher who wrote ‘Dharti’, had been in the courtyard when the flood struck; he lost his younger brother, sister-in-law and niece. Deva Ram, 52, mourns two sisters. Pavitra Singh, 31, lost an uncle. “Sometimes I think about those 15 metres,” said Rajendra Singh, 33, a teacher who lost his mother. He pressed his palms together as if measuring the distance. “That’s all it was. A few steps. But if the school still stands, then so must we. If we don’t gather again, the silence will break them.”In the evenings, the teachers sit on the cracked steps of the schoolhouse, planning how to reopen as its rooms remain occupied by rescue teams. Around them, the noise of 25 earthmovers has quietened as the day’s rescue work winds down, no longer interrupting conversation. Boots stacked in corners; supplies against walls. The timetable rewritten on scrap paper. “If there are no benches, we will sit on the ground,” Rathore told TOI. “If the building’s not cleared, we’ll use a courtyard. If that’s not safe, we’ll sit in someone’s home... even under a tree. What matters is that the children hear each other again.”The children, too, have begun speaking of little else. Anmol Singh, 11, kept his books close. “I want to study. I don’t want to waste this second chance,” he said. Makkhan Singh, 14, asked teachers if they could start early, even without uniforms or blackboards. His classmate Rashi Devi said she wanted to revise her lessons before school reopens. Bhawna Devi, 13, has returned each day to the edge of the school compound, waiting to learn again.","Chasoti Middle School, 15 metres from the torrent’s path, has remained standing.

US ambassador announcement welcome development but concerns about dual role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-ambassador-announcement-welcome-development-but-concerns-about-dual-role/articleshow/123475987.cms,"Sergio Gor

The announcement by President Donald Trump – 7 months after he assumed office – that he’s promoting close aide Sergio Gor to be the next US ambassador is a welcome development for India, suggesting a willingness to intensify bilateral engagement at a time the relationship seems to be in a free fall.The appointment, subject to Senate confirmation, was long overdue and the fact that Gor is a part of Trump’s inner circle should facilitate a candid engagement between the 2 sides on thorny issues like trade, Trump’s handling of Pakistan, immigration and India’s ties with Russia. The announcement about Gor also raises hopes of a Trump visit to India for the Quad summit in November, even as the relationship seems headed south because of the threat of additional tariffs on India.However, the unprecedented decision to have Gor double up as a special envoy for South and Central Asia has also caused concerns about a possible overreach by Washington on India-Pakistan affairs.The announcement by Trump was greeted with muted response in India. Jaishankar didn’t comment on the US announcement about its new ambassador to India at an Economic Times event, merely saying he had read about it. Indian officials were also cagey about offering any observation, choosing to wait for more clarity to emerge about his role.This is mainly because of the US efforts to project India and Pakistan in terms of equivalence, which India saw as blurring the lines between the aggressor and the victim, following the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, and the subsequent Op Sindoor in May.These efforts have seen Trump declaring umpteen times he brokered a “ceasefire” between the 2 countries, even after PM Narendra Modi “clearly conveyed” to Trump on June 17 that neither the India-US trade deal nor any mediation proposal was discussed between the 2 sides in the build-up to the cessation of hostilities. Jaishankar reiterated Saturday it was negotiated directly between India and Pakistan after “very bad things” happened to the Pakistani airfields.India has strongly resisted past attempts by the US to assign itself any role in addressing the Kashmir issue. In 2009, the Indian government pushed back against the Obama administration, forcing it to keep India outside of the purview of Richard Holbrooke, who was appointed envoy for the Af-Pak region.Trump has offered to mediate more forcefully between the 2 countries this time and India will be alert to any attempt to use the appointment of Gor as a stepping stone by the US to impose itself on issues that India maintains can only be addressed bilaterally. As Jaishankar reiterated Saturday, there has been a national consensus for more than 50 years that India won’t accept any mediation in its relations with Pakistan.",Sergio Gor will be the next US ambassador to India. The appointment is a welcome development for India. Gor will double up as a special envoy for South and Central Asia. There are concerns about a possible overreach by Washington on India-Pakistan affairs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123476161,imgsize-1083089,width-400,resizemode-4/123476161.jpg"

'No exception for me': What PM Modi said on bills to sack jailed ministers - Kiren Rijiju reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-exception-to-me-what-pm-modi-said-on-bills-to-sack-jailed-ministers-kiren-rijiju-reveals/articleshow/123474352.cms,"NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear there would be ""no exception for him"" in the bill that allows sacking of ministers facing corruption or serious charges.Speaking to news agency ANI, Kiren Rijiju said, ""PM Modi told the cabinet that the recommendation is to keep the prime minister out of this bill, but he did not agree. PM Modi refused to give an exception to the prime minister.""""The PM is also a citizen, and he should not have special protection. Most of the CMs are from our party. If they do something wrong, they have to leave their position"" he said.""Any position, whether CM, PM or Union Ministers, cannot be above the law. What objection does the Opposition have? The nation is welcoming this revolutionary bill,"" he added.The remarks came after Union home minister Amit Shah tabled three bills in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, including the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks automatic removal of the prime minister, chief ministers, or ministers if they face corruption charges or serious offences and remain in custody for 30 consecutive days.Earlier, while addressing a rally in Gaya on Friday, PM Modi had also questioned how CMs and ministers continue in office despite being jailed, while even junior government employees face automatic suspension if imprisoned for more than 50 hours.""But a CM, a minister, or even a PM can enjoy staying in the government even from jail... Some time ago, we saw how files were being signed from jail and how government orders were given from jail,"" PM Modi said.""If leaders have such an attitude, how can we fight corruption. NDA government has brought a law against corruption, and the Prime Minister also comes under its purview,"" he added.Rijiju further said that while the monsoon session was successful for the ruling government in passing important bills, it was a ""failure from the Opposition's point of view.""Rijiju also launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of working in coordination with ""anti-India"" billionaire George Soros.""Rahul Gandhi is going on a very dangerous track. George Soros says that one trillion dollars are kept to destabilise the Indian government. The anti-India Khalistan force sitting in Canada, the US, the UK, and many Left organisations are conspiring to work against the country. Rahul Gandhi and Congress are working in coordination with them and weakening the country. This is very worrisome. But no one can destabilise the country under PM Modi's leadership,"" Rijiju said.""When Congress cannot win elections, then they and the forces against India together start attacking the government and the institutions so that the public loses faith in this country's institutions... They have repeatedly said that the judiciary and the Election Commission are sold to weaken them"" he added.Taking another swipe at the leader of opposition, Rijiju said even Congress MPs feel uncomfortable when Rahul Gandhi speaks in Parliament.""Rahul Gandhi kuch bolte hain, unke saare MPs bahot uncomfortable ho jaate hain. Wo darte hain ye anapshanap baatein karenge, uska khamiyaza party ko bhugatna padta hai (When Rahul Gandhi speaks, his MPs get uncomfortable what nonsense he will speak, the party will have to bear its consequences,"" he added.","PM Narendra Modi made it clear there would be ""no exception for him"" in the bill that allows sacking of ministers facing corruption or serious charges.

Postal services to the US ‘temporarily suspended’ amid new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/postal-services-to-the-us-temporarily-suspended-amid-new-rules/articleshow/123474110.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Govt has temporarily suspended postal services to the US as US-bound air carriers have denied carrying shipments due to lack of clarity in new norms issued by the American customs department, Ministry of Communications said on Saturday.However, services will continue for letters, documents and gift items up to $100. The exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed to the US, subject to further clarifications from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and United States Postal Service (USPS), the ministry said in a statement.Under an Executive Order issued by the US administration on July 30, 2025, goods valued above $100 will be subject to customs duties in America with effect from August 29 onwards.As per the order, transport carriers delivering shipments through the international postal network, or other “qualified parties” approved by the US CBP, are required to collect and remit duties on postal shipments.“While CBP issued certain guidelines on August 15, 2025, several critical processes relating to the designation of “qualified parties” and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined.Consequently, U.S. bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25, citing lack of operational and technical readiness,” the Communications Ministry said.Following the development, the Department of Posts has decided to “temporarily suspend booking of all types of postal articles” destined for the US with effect from Monday, except letters/documents and gift items up to $100 in value.The Postal Department is closely monitoring the evolving situation in coordination with all stakeholders, and every effort is being made to normalize services at the earliest possible opportunity. “Customers who have already booked articles that cannot be dispatched to the US due to these circumstances may seek a refund of postage. The Department of Posts deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to customers and assures that all possible measures are being undertaken to resume full services to the US at the earliest,” the statement said.According to the decision by US authorities, all international postal items destined for the country, regardless of their value, will be subject to customs duties as per the country-specific International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.","U.S-bound air carriers have denied carrying shipments due to lack of clarity in new norms issued by the American customs department.

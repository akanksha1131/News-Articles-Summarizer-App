The defence ministry has granted the Army Chief expanded authority to mobilise the Territorial Army amid heightened tensions with Pakistan. Under Rule 33 of the Territorial Army Act, 1948, the Army Chief can call upon all officers and enrolled personnel of the Territorial Army to provide essential security or supplement regular Army operations. But what is the Territorial Army?After the 1857 revolt, the British reorganised local militia into volunteer forces, which saw action in overseas conflicts like the Second Boer War and World War I.In 1920, the Indian Territorial Force was established, which is the direct precursor to today’s Territorial Army.After Independence, the need for a homegrown citizens’ army was recognised and the Territorial Army Act was passed in Aug 1948. Indian Territorial Army was inaugurated on Oct 9, 1949, envisioned as a volunteer reserve force of “citizen soldiers” who would serve part-time in defence of the nation. The primary motive was to create a second line of defence that could be mobilised in emergencies. By allowing civilians to serve in uniform on a part-time basis, India’s leaders sought to harness the patriotism and skills of ordinary citizens for national defence.TA is a volunteer force comprising professionals, businessmen, and others who undergo military training in their spare time. Applicants must be Indian citizens, 18-42 years old and be medically fit. TA personnel train for about two months every year.An Army Order in 1984 succinctly described the TA’s role as: To “relieve the regular Army from static duties and assist civil administration in dealing with natural calamities and maintenance of essential services, and to provide units for the regular Army as and when required”. In practice, this means the TA is tasked to:➤ Augment the Army’s manpower in war➤ Bolster counterinsurgency operations and maintain law and order in troubled areas➤ Ensure critical services (like railways, telecommunications, etc) continue running during war or emergencies➤ Assist civil authorities during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, cyclones) or other emergenciesOften nicknamed the “Terriers”, TA units have helped out on several occasions:Soon after inception, TA units were involved in supplementary roles during the first Indo-Pak conflict in Kashmir (1947–48) and the border skirmishes preceding the 1962 Sino-Indian War. During the 1962 hostilities, TACurrent strength of Territorial Army, comprising 65 units across India was fully mobilised. They provided logistical support in the Himalayas and manned defensive positions in rear areas.In both the IndoPakistani wars the TA was again called upon en masse. TA battalions performed vital combat support and logistics roles alongside the Army.The TA was deployed in Operation Rakshak, supporting counter-insurgency operations first in Punjab (against Sikh militancy) and later in Jammu & Kashmir (against Pakistan-backed militants). TA soldiers carried out patrols, manned checkpoints, and protected infrastructure in these states. In the late 1980s, Operation Pawan saw the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka (1987–1990) battling Tamil insurgents. TA units were sent to Sri Lanka as part of this mission, primarily in logistical and support roles to the peacekeeping troops.They secured rear zones, ammunition depots, and lines of supply during the Kargil conflict.","The Territorial Army was established in 1949.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah strongly criticised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for approving a $1 billion loan to Pakistan amid escalating border tensions between the two nations.His comments came as Pakistan launched attacks on 26 locations across India on Saturday, prompting immediate retaliatory strikes from Army.""I’m not sure how the 'International Community' thinks the current tension in the subcontinent will be de-escalated when the IMF essentially reimburses Pakistan for all the ordnance it is using to devastate Poonch, Rajouri, Uri, Tangdhar & so many other places,"" he wrote on X.On Friday, IMF approved the immediate disbursement of the loan to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF), drawing sharp opposition from India, which warned the funds could be misused to support state-sponsored cross-border terrorism.""This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around USD 1 billion (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about USD 2.1 billion (SDR 1.52 billion),"" a statement from the agency said.In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved Pakistan's request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), with access of about $1.4 billion.As per the statement, the RSF would support Pakistan's efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to natural disasters and to build economic and climate resilience.India expressed its dissent by abstaining from the crucial IMF vote. The Indian government highlighted concerns about Pakistan's track record, pointing out that the country has received IMF assistance for 28 out of the past 35 years, including four separate programs in recent years, without implementing substantial reforms.India also emphasized that providing financial support to a nation known for supporting terrorism not only poses reputational risks for international organizations but also goes against established global principles.",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah criticized the international community and IMF for approving a $1 billion loan to Pakistan.

India carried out a retaliatory action after Pakistan launched an attack on 26 locations on friday night, news agency ANI reported.

At least 4 airbases in Pakistan have been targeted by Indian strikes.

Pakistan claimed that Indian missiles targeted Nur Khan, Murid, and Rafiqui airbases.

Pakistan said its air defence systems intercepted most of the incoming missiles.

Pakistan’s military stated that no air force assets were damaged.

Pakistan alleged that some of the Indian missiles landed inside India and in Afghanistan.

A counterattack was launched by Pakistan shortly after the press conference, according to state media, as quoted by PTI.

Pakistan’s airspace was shut from 3.15 am to 12 noon, with further updates awaited.

A blackout was enforced in Jammu and Kashmir’s Akhnoor following explosions and sirens.

Heavy engagement going on with Pakistan over Srinagar and adjoining areas. Surface to air missile systems activated in the area by forces.

Civilian areas in Jammu city suffer damages due to shelling by Pakistan.

Another blackout was imposed in Jalandhar, Punjab, after drones were reportedly spotted.

The G7 nations urged immediate de-escalation amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following alleged missile strikes. ""We, the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, strongly condemn the egregious terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 and urge maximum restraint from both India and Pakistan,"" it said in a statement.

NEW DELHI: Multiple explosions were reported at several Pakistani military bases early Saturday morning, as tensions with India reached a new high. A Reuters witness confirmed blasts at three bases, prompting fears of wider conflict in the region.Meanwhile, three loud explosions were heard in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Srinagar, Akhnoor , Rajouri, Udhampur and Pooch following which a complete blackout was imposed.Similarly, a blackout was enforced in Punjab’s Jalandhar after drone sightings were reported.Also read: Operation Sindoor: Multiple explosions heard at several Pakistan air bases Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry addressed the media at 4 am, claiming Indian jets had fired air-to-surface missiles at three of their key airbases.

NEW DELHI: Following Pakistan's repeated failure to breach India's air defence, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir may engineer terror attacks inside India.Sources said the possibility of Munir, who as ISI chief scripted the 2019 Pulwama suicide attack, ordering Pakistan's terror proxies to carry out such strikes was real, adding India was ramping up its defences to prevent them.The sources pointed to the presence of senior Pakistan army personnel at the funeral of terrorists who were killed in India's strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and POK on the night of May 6-7. ""It was quite a moment when they dropped the fiction of terrorists being non-state actors; that too, when the global spotlight is trained on them. While it may signal defiance, it underlined their compulsion not to offend the jihadis they have raised and trained to hurt India,"" said a senior source. He also said that for Pakistan to desert terrorists at a time when they are grieving, fearful and, perhaps, thirsting for revenge would amount to abandoning their favourite weapon against India.As per the estimate of the security establishment here, the risk of terrorists trying to set off fresh attacks has risen also because of India’s success in neutralising the efforts to breach its air defence and target its military facilities over the past 48 hours. “They may fall back on the default option of using terror proxies to compensate for the failure of their forces,” a senior govt functionary involved in decision-making said. “Tragic aberrations like the Pahalgam massacre notwithstanding, India has been very successful in thwarting terror attacks over the past 10 years. But now we have to brace for a higher level of desperation,” he said.","Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir may engineer terror attacks inside India.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday night repelled 300 to 400 drones launched by Pakistan across the entire western front to target military and civilian establishments and then undertook a swift counter-strike against four air defence sites, even as deadly artillery duels led to soldiers being killed on both sides.The Pakistani attack resumed on Friday night, with drones once again being spotted in 26 locations in a wide arc, ranging from Srinagar, Baramulla and Awantipora in the north to Bhuj in the south, along both the international border and the Line of Control with Pakistan.The locations targeted included Srinagar airport , Avantipora air base, Baramulla, Nagrota, Jammu, Ferozpur, Pathankot, Fazilka, Lalgarh Jatta, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bhuj, Kuarbet and Lakhi Nala.""These included armed drones posing potential threats to civilian and military targets,"" an officer said.The attack on Srinagar airport followed one on Jammu the previous night.While the armed forces neutralised the bulk of the drones with a variety of air defence weapons, an armed drone targeted a civilian area in Ferozpur, resulting in severe injuries to members of a family.On Thursday, the intrusion by drones, mainly Turkish but some also from China, came in three waves at 36 locations across the LoC and IB, stretching from Leh to Sir Creek, between 8pm and midnight.Pakistan also used an armed UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to target Bathinda military station, headquarters of the Army's 10 'Chetak Corps'. The UAV was swiftly detected and neutralised by Indian air defence systems.""These provocative and escalatory actions taken by Pakistan last night were targeted at Indian cities and civilian infrastructure, in addition to some military targets. The Indian armed forces responded proportionately, adequately and responsibly,"" foreign secretary Vikram Misri said at a briefing.The counter-strike saw four Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy armed drones being launched once again by the IAF against four air defence sites in Pakistan. ""One of our drones was able to destroy an air defence radar,"" Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said.Indian air defence units, which are plugged into the IAF's fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) network, destroyed 50 of the Pakistani drones using L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ZU-23 twin-barrel guns and other weapons.Another 20 drones were brought down after being jammed by a variety of devices, while the rest flew back across the border.With some of the drones being unarmed, Wing Commander Singh said, ""The possible purpose of these large-scale aerial intrusions was to test our air defence systems and gather intelligence.""Preliminary forensic analysis of some drone debris showed they were Asisguard Songar drones of Turkey, she said. Equipped with both daylight and infrared cameras, the Turkish drones have an operational range of 10 km and can be configured for various missions ranging from area surveillance to target detection and destruction.Turkiye has deep ties with Pakistan and has repeatedly endorsed Islamabad's position on Kashmir.Along the 778-km LoC, Pakistan also carried out heavy artillery shelling and used armed drones in Tangdhar, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar, Rajouri, Akhnoor and Udhampur areas in Jammu & Kashmir on Thursday night.Around 20 ceasefire violations were recorded, 13 south of the Pir Panjal range and seven north of it. In the heavy exchange of fire, at least one Indian soldier was killed and another 10 injured. Two civilian deaths were also reported from the Uri sector. ""Pakistan army also suffered major losses in Indian retaliatory fire,"" Colonel Sofia Qureshi said.The shadowboxing between the rival navies also continued in the northern Arabian Sea, with both issuing 'NavArea' warnings for ships to stay away from specified coordinates due to firing exercises by their warships. India's drills will take place till May 13, while Pakistan's will finish a day earlier.","Pak used Turkiye-built armed drones in strikes across LoC and IB.

NEW DELHI: Given the evolving conflict situation since the launch of ' Operation Sindoor ' by India against Pakistan in response to the killing of 26 tourists at Pahalgam, Supreme Court on Friday told the Centre that the time is not right for the discharge of 69 short service commission officers (SSCOs), including 47 women.""In the prevailing situation, let us not bring their morale down.They are brilliant officers. Their services can be used somewhere else. This is not the time to force them to roam the corridors of the Supreme Court. They can be somewhere else to serve the country,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said it is an administrative decision to discharge SSCOs who, after completing 14 years of service, are not found fit for permanent commission (PC). ""This is based on a policy to keep the armed forces young,"" she said.Appearing for Lt Col Geeta Sharma , senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the administrative decision could not be discriminatory and that when there are vacancies in PC officers' posts, there is no reason why SSCOs like Sharma are not granted PC. Guruswamy cited the example of Col Sofiya Qureshi, who fought a legal battle to get PC and is now seen briefing the media about the Operation Sindoor.The bench said the question before the court is purely a legal one and has nothing to do with individual officers. However, it stayed the discharge of SSCOs till Aug 6-7, when the court would hear the petitioners and the govt in detail.Bhati informed the court that Sharma, commissioned in the Corps of Signals in March 2011, was considered for permanent commission in Dec 2020 and was found fit for four-year extension of service.For her batch of 204 SSCOs, 77 technical and 127 non-technical, there were 119 vacancies of permanent commission. PC was granted to 118 SSCOs, and a four-year extension to 56 others. In all, 30 batchmates of Sharma were released from service from March 18. However, the release of eight female SSCOs has been stayed.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban.

JAISALMER: Peace was what I wanted to pray for when I was looking to join my family Thursday at Chundhi GaneshTemple, 12km from Jaisalmer. Not long after that, though, I was caught in a crossfire - of blasts, gunfire and chaos. Anything but peace.That was how the evening unfolded for me in this Rajasthan border city, engulfed in terror of Pakistani drone attacks near the high-security Pokhran area.My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm. I set out to join them later and had just reached Hanuman Chowk, some distance from my home, around 9pm when I was halted by a hail of deafening blasts overhead, followed by the unmistakable rat-a-tat of gunfire. I pulled over and looked skyward, my heart pounding as multiple explosions shattered the air. Our anti-drone defence systems sprang into action, their rapid fire piercing the darkness as they attempted to neutralise the threats.My thoughts turned to my family. Matters got worse as I learned my son Harshad was on a bus to Jaipur, now caught in the middle of the crisis.Word about the drones spread like wildfire. So did panic. Youths took positions at major intersections, forcing vehicles to turn off lights and threatening those who didn't comply with sticks. Their actions, though aggressive, were driven by the need to protect the city from Pakistani projectiles. The next few hours were frenetic. My family left for home but faced renewed drone attacks around 10pm. This forced them to take shelter at Amarsagar Jain Temple.Heavy rain added to their ordeal. When they tried to return again, they were stopped by police at Moomal Chowk, on the outskirts. This was a frustrating, but necessary, security drill. They later made their way to a restaurant where they waited till 1am (Friday) till it was safe to cover the rest of the way home.In the meantime, I had my son get off the bus at Khetolai, 80km from Jaisalmer, and organised overnight accommodation for him in a village. It wasn't until 2am that my family made it home in Jaisalmer.As a journalist, I am battle-hardened, having covered many challenging situations. But Thursday offered a reality check. My own family was in peril. The Pakistani fusillade has left me deeply shaken. This night will remain etched in memory.","My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Why did Valluvar place this couplet ninth in the sequence?

Aadhi Bhagavan – the primordial one

Vaalarivan – The one of flawless wisdom

Malarmisai Eginan – The one whose feet rest upon the flower

Vendudal Vendaamai Ilaan – The one beyond desire and aversion

Iraivan – the sovereign being

Pori Vaayil Aindhu Aviththaan – The one who mastered the five senses

Thanakku Uvamai Illadhaan – None can be compared to Him

Ara Azhi Andhanan – Ocean of virtue and justice

""Kolil pori-yir gunam ilave enn gunaththaan

Thaalai vanangaa thalai.""

Palsied and pointless is the head

That bows not to the One of Eight-Fold Grace.

In the opening chapter of the introductory section of the, Valluvar performs a rare literary feat—dedicating ten couplets solely to exalting the Divine, never revealing—even faintly—his own religious affiliation.The God he praises is cloaked in universality. His words, though deeply reverent, are so free of sectarian markers that the divine he invokes could be an embodiment of virtues. Over the centuries, commentators have drawn from the wells of Saiva Siddhantha, Vaishnavism, Jainism, Buddhism, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, and even Zoroastrianism to interpret these verses.Yet, the ambiguity has ignited a literary debate among Tamil scholars: Who was Valluvar? What was his faith ?Thiru V Kalyanasundaranar and Vayapuri Pillai, both erudite scholars, suggest that the spiritual overtones of the first chapter hint at Jain influences. On the other hand, Thiru Vajravel Mudhaliyar sees the soul ofsteeped in Saiva Siddhanta. Christian missionary-scholar G U Pope declared that theechoed the Sermon on the Mount. Opinions differ, but there is near-universal agreement on one point: Valluvar wrote for the universal human—unbound by religious identity , yet deeply spiritual.The most debated verse in this opening chapter is the ninth couplet, where God is described as ‘the One who possesses the Eight-Fold Excellence’.Curiously, Valluvar does not elaborate on what these eight attributes are. Perhaps, in his time, they needed no clarification. Or he left it open, inviting seekers to look within and interpret for themselves.Saiva Siddhanta describes the eight traits as supreme grace, omnipotence, incomparability, pure intelligence, omniscience, detachment, infinite bliss, and absolute purity.Jainism, meanwhile, speaks of the eight divine signs that adorn a, the enlightened guide—divine seat, halo, celestial fan, triple umbrella, Ashoka tree, floral rain, heavenly music, and divine proclamation. Jain philosophy also speaks of eight karmic bonds from which the soul must liberate itself—karmas that obscure knowledge, perception, obstruct effort, create delusion, determine body, status, emotion, and lifespan.Some scholars who consider Valluvar as a Siddhar, attribute the couplet to the eight supernatural faculties associated with enlightenment.Amidst this swirl of interpretations, a quiet yet profound insight was once offered by a teacher of mine. She asked:I had no answer.She smiled and said, “Look at the first eight couplets. Each one praises the Divine with a unique attribute. The ninth simply gathers them all—referring to God as the One who embodies these eight virtues already described.”A moment of revelation. Simple, yet powerful.Indeed, the preceding eight couplets refer to God in eight exalted ways:Then comes the ninth, the verse that sparked centuries of debate:What a line—soft in its cadence, sharp in its implication.In leaving the Divine unnamed and unclaimed, Valluvar did more than avoid controversy. He handed us a mirror polished with humility and universality. Name and form of the God matters, he seems to say, but the virtues we see in the Divine—and seek in ourselves, matter even more.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Taylor Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam",Shedeur Sanders made his Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp debut on Friday.

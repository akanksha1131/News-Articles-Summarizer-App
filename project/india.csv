NEW DELHI: Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has dismissed media reports suggesting delays in the manufacturing of Vande Bharat sleeper train due to resign clearance problems. Addressing the media on Thursday, Vaishnaw said that the design process was never an issue with the Russian firm Transmasholding (TMH), contracted to produce the train sets.Earlier reports claimed Indian Railways requested design modifications, including the addition of toilets and pantry cars, which allegedly delayed the ministry’s approval of the revised design.Vaishnaw refuted these claims, saying the delays were actually due to TMH’s limited manufacturing capacity , as the company is accustomed to producing trains with only six to eight coaches—standard in Russia.The minister clarified that Indian Railways had provided TMH with the Vande Bharat design and explicitly specified the requirement for train sets with 16, 20, or 24 coaches, reflecting India’s larger population and higher passenger demand .""The firm doesn't have experience to manufacture a train set of more than six or eight coaches. We had clearly told them that we will give them design of Vande Bharat to follow. What they need is more manufacturing teams,"" Vaishnaw said.He added, ""I want to clarify that when the contract was signed, it clearly said that they have to manufacture train sets with coaches 16/20/24.""Vaishnaw also mentioned that some routes in India require 24-coach trains, while others need 16-coach configurations, and TMH was initially unprepared to meet these demands. He added that the issues have been resolved, and production will commence soon.The minister reiterated Indian Railways’ commitment to the timely execution of the project and expressed confidence in TMH’s ability to adapt to the unique requirements of India’s rail network.The contract requires TMH to manufacture 1,920 sleeper coaches , crucial for the expansion of the Vande Bharat fleet.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw dismissed media reports suggesting delays in the manufacturing of Vande Bharat sleeper train due to resign clearance problems.

'Canada not providing security to our consular camps'



NEW DELHI: Indian consulate officials in Canada have been informed that they were under ""audio and video surveillance and that their private communications have also been intercepted,"" ministry of external affairs said on Thursday. It added that the Indian government had already lodged a protests with the Justin Trudeau government on November 2 citing ""flagrant violation of all diplomatic provisions.""""Recently, consular officials at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver were informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been, and continue to be under audio and video surveillance and that their private communications have also been intercepted,"" Kirti Vardhan Singh said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.The minister of state in the ministry of external affairs was responding to a question of whether there were ""any instances of cyber surveillance or other forms of surveillance targeting Indian diplomats in Canada.""""Government of India lodged a strong protest with the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi on this issue. vide its Note Verbale dated 02 November 2024 as these actions were a flagrant violation of all diplomatic provisions,"" the statement said.The minister, in his reply, also referenced a statement made by the MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during the November 2 media briefing.""By citing technicalities, the Canadian Government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation. Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices,” Jaiswal had said.The minister said that Canadian authorities have successfully ensured the protection of Indian diplomats and diplomatic properties, they have expressed their inability to provide security for our consular camps against violent acts by secessionist and extremist groups.""While the Canadian authorities have been able to provide security protection to our diplomats and diplomatic properties, they have recently expressed their inability to provide security cover to our Consular Camps from the violent acts of secessionist and extremist elements. This has prevented our diplomats and consular officers to render much-sought after consular and passport-related services at camps specially organized with the help of the community members for the benefit of Indian as well as Canadian citizens, particularly senior citizens / retirees who seek ""life certificates” to get their pensions,"" he said.""This includes preventing secessionist and extremist elements from glorifying the assassination of our leaders; issuing threats to our current political leadership and diplomats; disrespecting and vandalising places of worship; and espousing for the balkanization of India by holding so-called referendums,"" he said.When asked about the safety and security of Indian officials in Canada, Singh replied, ""Government of India remains continuously engaged with the Canadian side to ensure that adequate protection is offered at all times to our diplomatic personnel and properties.""India and Canada relations hit a rock bottom after the two countries expelled each other's diplomats amid escalating tension the assassination of a Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil.India had also lodged a strong protested over the ""absurd and baseless"" allegations made by a Canadian minister regarding home minister Amit Shah authorised attacks in Canada.The relations degraded even further after attacks on Hindu temples in Canada and its condemnation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","Indian consulate officials in Canada have been informed that they were under ""audio and video surveillance and that their private communications have also been intercepted,"" ministry of external affairs said.

This was the first meeting. We had a discussion with Amit Shah and JP Nadda,"" Shinde said.""There will be another meeting of the Mahayuti.

Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari: Bangladesh monk who’s sparked calls for a ban on Iskcon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinmoy-krishna-das-brahmachari-bangladesh-monk-whos-sparked-calls-for-a-ban-on-iskcon/articleshow/115787770.cms,"Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, is an ISKCON monk and Hindu leader who was recently arrested in Bangladesh for leading protests against violence towards Hindus. His detention has raised global concerns about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh and freedom of peaceful assembly.

A popular preacher who began young

Arrested on sedition charges

A worrisome trend

Attacks against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina in Aug this year have sparked widespread concern and caused a wrinkle in New Delhi’s ties with Dhaka. Monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who was associated with Gaudiya Vaishnav organisation Iskcon’s Bangladesh chapter before being expelled in Oct this year for violating its rules, emerged as an outspoken critic of the persecution of minorities in the neighbouring country. Violence during protests over his arrest on sedition charges drew a sharp reaction from the Indian govt and triggered calls in Bangladesh for a ban on Iskcon with the interim govt in Dhaka saying it was treating the matter seriously.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.He’s a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot, a minority Hindu body. Following the Aug 5 overthrow of the Awami League govt — it is seen as having opened up space for the revival of right-wing outfits — Das has campaigned against targeted attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.Das is reportedly facing a sedition case for disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally in Oct. He was arrested with 18 others for allegedly hoisting a saffron flag above Bangladesh’s national flag in Chittagong on Oct 25. That led to a complaint of “desecration” of and “contempt for the country’s sovereignty”. Complainant Md Feroze Khan claimed the accused en gaged in “activities aimed at destabilising the nation by fostering an anarchic environment”.Das was arrested on Nov 25 from Dhaka airport while waiting to board a flight to Chittagong. Earlier, on Nov 22, he had addressed a large rally in Rangpur against attacks on Hindus. His detention sparked protests among Hindus in Bangladesh and, on Nov 26, New Delhi and Dhaka had a sharp exchange after communal tensions flared up in Chittagong — which left one person dead — following a court’s denial of bail to Das. Iskcon In Crosshairs, Too The violence in Chittagong prompted the interim govt to say it would determine whether action should be taken over the episode. Additionally, a Bangladesh Supreme Court lawyer brought a petition seeking a ban on Iskcon, alleging it to be a fundamentalist organisation. While Iskcon rejected those claims, reports on Thursday said the high court in Dhaka had refused to ban the organisation’s Bangladesh chapter.The plea for a ban on Iskcon was backed by powerful students’ groups, a prominent voice in Bangladesh since their successful movement to topple the govt of Sheikh Hasina.However, reports said that the rightwing BNP, the party of former PM Khaleda Zia, called for a ‘fair and transparent’ probe into the charges against Das after alleging the involvement of vested interests in the matter.While Das’s arrest further threatens to complicate bilateral ties in the wake of the events that unfolded since Aug 5 — New Delhi has flagged its “deep concern” while Dhaka has noted that it was an “internal matter” — senior Iskcon members have demanded the intervention of the Indian and Bangladeshi govts to ensure his immediate release.In a post on X, Iskcon vice president Radharamn Das said, “Mass killing is going on in Hazari Goli, Chittagong. They are branding every Hindu as ‘dalal’ of Iskcon and attacking. I am shocked by the videos I am receiving from the worried congregation in Bangladesh.” Rights & Risks Analysis Group (RRAG), a Delhi-based NGO, has filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention against the “illegal and arbitrary detention of the most prominent minority Hindu religious monk in Bangladesh”. It said there was no evidence of Sanatani Jot’s Das being involved in the alleged desecration of the Bangladeshi flag and that “the actual alleged offenders were not identified/named”.The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, an umbrella organisation of minority groups, also denounced Chinmoy Das’s arrest. A report titled ‘100 Days After the Fall of the Authoritarian Regime’ by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) says “2,010 incidents of communal violence occurred between August 5 and 20” leading to “the death of nine people of a minority community”. It also notes that the influence of religion-based politics is increasing in the country.In the run-up to the US elections, President-elect Donald Trump expressed his concern over rising violence against Bangladeshi Hindus.","Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, is an ISKCON monk and Hindu leader.

250kg of debris cleared from Sindhudurg reefs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/250kg-of-debris-cleared-from-sindhudurg-reefs/articleshow/115787379.cms,"Marine debris, including ghost nets abandoned or lost during fishing operations, often drifts with ocean currents, entangling corals and devastating marine life

NAVI MUMBAI: India’s first largescale ocean floor cleanup operation was launched in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg coral reefs Wednesday, with seven certified scuba divers collecting around 250kg of non-biodegradable waste from the seabed. This pioneering initiative to restore marine biodiversity and ecosystems, led by state agencies and involving several NGOs, targeted a 150m radius near Sindhudurg Fort. The cleanup involved careful extraction, bundling, and disposal of mainly discarded or lost nylon fishing nets, which are complicated further by underwater challenges.Maharashtra-based senior scientist Ashok Kadam of Fisheries Survey of India told TOI, “This is the first ocean floor cleanup drive to be organised by govt and private bodies together. The programme was conceptualised by ministry of environment, forest, and climate change to raise awareness about our ocean conservation and keeping our coasts clean, plastic free. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and fisheries department have taken the lead in this regard.” The initiative was led by MPCB, Fisheries Survey of India (Mumbai base), NGO Vanashakti along with local partners like state fisheries department, Malvan Nagar Parishad, Neelkranti, Youth Beats for Environment, Maharashtra Maritime Board, and Malvan Tourist Group.Kadam further said that the Union ministry has earmarked funds of around Rs 40 crore for conducting awareness programmes with regards to keeping our oceans and coasts clean. School and college students will also be involved in future cleanup drives, he added.Marine debris, including ghost nets abandoned or lost during fishing operations, often drifts with ocean currents, entangling corals and devastating marine life. “Additionally, these ghost nets detract from the natural beauty of the region, impacting tourism in Malvan, a hotspot for coral reef exploration and marine education,” said environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti.

The discussion was brief and he was walking back to the pavilion when he collapsed. The events were caught on camera as the match was being streamed live. Patel was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him dead.“He didn’t have history of any medical condition,” said Naseer Khan, another cricketer. “He was in good physical condition. In fact, he was an allrounder who loved the game. We’re all still in shock.”Patel leaves behind a wife and three daughters, the youngest only four months old. A massive crowd turned up for his last rites near Maulana Azad College late on Wednesday. Patel owned a cricket team, had a real-estate business and ran a juice shop. His death was hauntingly similar to that of cricketer Habib Shaikh’s who also died while playing a match, on Sept 7 in Pune.

World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday. (Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

The white saree with its golden border was more than a fashion statement — it symbolised her connection to Wayanad, the constituency that sent her to the Parliament with a resounding victory.Holding a copy of the Constitution, Priyanka took oath in a Kasavu saree, a symbol of Kerala’s cultural unity.Priyanka’s attire evoked memories of her grandmother, Indira Gandhi , who was known for her wardrobe choices that carried symbolic messages. Indira famously championed the Swadeshi movement, often wearing Indian block prints and handloom fabrics to promote the country’s textile heritage.When asked about her thoughts during the ceremony, Priyanka said, “Yes, I remembered her [Indira Gandhi], and I also remembered my father.”Priyanka’s family members, including her mother Sonia Gandhi, brother Rahul Gandhi, and her children Raihan and Miraya Vadra, were present to witness her entry into the Parliament.Priyanka Gandhi secured the seat with a decisive margin of 4,10,931 votes, defeating Sathyan Mokeri of the Communist Party of India. This win reaffirmed Wayanad’s status as a Congress bastion, which Rahul Gandhi had previously represented.Rahul, who had won both the Wayanad and Raebareli seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections, chose to retain the latter, leaving Wayanad to his sister.Her debut came alongside by-elections held in 48 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha constituencies across 15 states.","Priyanka Gandhi secured the seat with a decisive margin of 4,10,931 votes, defeating Sathyan Mokeri of the Communist Party of India.

This decision has led to a stalemate between the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), with the ICC yet to find a resolution. The Champions Trophy, scheduled for February 19 to March 9, 2025, has been overshadowed by growing political tensions, further worsened by recent instability in Pakistan.On Tuesday, Sri Lanka’s A team withdrew from their tour of Pakistan mid-series due to unrest in Islamabad, fuelling concerns among other cricketing nations about safety. This has strengthened the case for either a hybrid model, where some matches are played in neutral venues, or relocating the entire tournament outside Pakistan. However, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi remains firm on hosting the event, dismissing the hybrid model and calling for equality in cricketing relations. “Our stance is clear. If we play in India, they should play here,” he said.The PCB has urged the ICC for clarity on India’s objections, emphasising that decisions must prioritise the sport's interests. The ICC Board is expected to meet on November 29 to address the impasse, with Pakistan insisting that any resolution respects the principle of fairness.","RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav criticises India's decision to skip the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan.

Over 140 candidates belonging to the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from the management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to over Rs 90 lakh per annum. This has led to many aspirants questioning how these candidates managed to get the EWS certificate if they could afford to pay over a crore for a threeyear postgraduate course. The first round of allotment of postgraduate seats in medical colleges was announced on Nov 20.Out of more than 24,600 seats allotted in this round, 135 seats from the management quota in private medical colleges have been allotted to candidates who registered as EWS. Eight NRI seats have been allotted to EWS candidates.For instance, an MS Orthopaedics seat in the management quota of Sri Lakshmi Narayana Institute of Medical sciences in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee comes up to Rs 1.6 crore for the entire course, has been allotted to an EWS candidate. Similarly, an EWS candidate has got an MD Radiology seat from the NRI quota in Rajarajeswari Medical College and Hospital, Mysore. The annual fee for this seat is Rs 91 lakh, which translates to over Rs 2.7 crore for the course.Many MBBS graduates who appeared for the NEET-PG exam claimed there was a huge increase in candidates using fake EWS certificates and demanded the govt initiate an inquiry. “It’s frustrating to see EWS candidates have taken admission in colleges that charge fees in crores.

KOTTAYAM: Four doctors have been booked in Kerala’s Alappuzha after a couple lodged a police complaint saying they failed to detect abnormalities in the fetus during prenatal care, and the baby was born with severe internal and external deformities. The couple, Anish and Surumi, also submitted complaints of medical negligence to CM Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister Veena George. The health minister has ordered a special investigation, led by the additional director of the health department, into the case.The initial inquiry failed to ascertain whether the negligence occurred at govt hospital or the private diagnostic labs involved. Surumi, 35, was under treatment for her third pregnancy and at Kadappuram Govt Women and Child Hospital in Alappuzha. She was admitted to the hospital on Oct 30 for delivery, but was referred to Govt Medical College Hospital on Nov 2 due to the absence of foetal movement and heartbeat.The baby was delivered on Nov 8 and was found to have severe deformities. The couple alleged that they were not informed of any abnormalities during pregnancy. The FIR names two female gynaecologists from the Kadappuram hospital and two doctors from private diagnostic labs. The lab doctors insist their scans highlighted high fluid levels in the scans, which should have prompted further testing, while the gynaecologists gave a statement that based on the scan reports, they had informed Surumi about the possibilities of deformities.","Surumi, 35, was under treatment for her third pregnancy and at Kadappuram Govt Women and Child Hospital in Alappuzha.

"Kerala, Adani arm ink supplementary pact on port project",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-adani-arm-ink-supplementary-pact-on-port-project/articleshow/115787320.cms,"Now handling 4.5 million containers, Vizhinjam port will be southern India’s largest freight terminal

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala signed Thursday a supplementary concession agreement with Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt Ltd , paving the way for earlier-than-expected revenue gains from Vizhinjam deep-water international seaport near Thiruvananthapuram. The Rs 7,700-crore port, built as a public-private partnership with Adani Group , is now set to be fully operational by Dec 2028.“With the capacity expansion to be completed by Dec 2028, the port’s total revenue projection has increased from Rs 54,750 crore to Rs 215,000 crore over the 36-year operational period. Govt’s revenue share will also increase from Rs 6,300 crore to Rs 35,000 crore,” minister for ports VN Vasavan said Thursday.The revised agreement ensures that the state will begin receiving its share of revenue from the project as originally planned in 2034, despite delays in construction. Under the previous pact, revenue sharing could have been delayed until 2039 due to project setbacks. The updated deal also broadens the revenue-sharing scope. Initially, the state was entitled to profits generated solely from the first phase of the port. Under the new terms, Adani Ports will share profits from all four phases starting in 2034.Indirect revenue for the state is projected to rise too. Kerala’s GST income from port operations is expected to total Rs 29,000 crore over the contract period. Corporate income tax revenue is also anticipated to grow. These changes will yield an additional Rs 48,000 crore in revenue, including the state’s share and GST over 36 years. With the capacity now expanded to 4.5 million containers annually — up from the initially planned 1 million — Vizhinjam port is set to become southern India’s largest freight terminal.The revised agreement also reduces Kerala’s financial commitments during the port’s construction phase. The state’s viability gap funding obligation to Adani Ports has been reduced from Rs 408.90 crore to Rs 365.10 crore.","Vizhinjam deep-water international seaport near Thiruvananthapuram is now set to be fully operational by Dec 2028.

Panchsheel murder accused needed money to pay off debt, rent flat for girlfriend: Police

NEW DELHI: Moving away from their initial line of probe, the south Delhi Police claimed Thursday that the 64-year-old businessman, found dead at his Panchsheel Park home,was killed during a robbery attempt. The latest revelation again raised questions about safety and security of senior citizens in the capital. Police arrested a debt-ridden man named Abhay Sikarwar for the crime and claimed to have solved the case. On Wednesday, area DCP Ankit Chauhan had said that the murder was “preplanned and premeditated”. However, one of the police units found evidence to the contrary and tracked down the suspect based on CCTV footage and technical surveillance.Police said Sikarwar was aware of the layout of the house as he had previously worked as a domestic help for a tenant on the third floor of the building four years ago.The intruder believed the businessman, Rohit Kumar Alagh , was living alone. An inquiry revealed that Sikarwar entered the house to steal as he was in acute need of money to pay off a loan and rent a flat for his girlfriend. Police said Sikarwar had planned the crime a few days earlier. On Monday, he entered the house for the theft but the businessman woke up. This led to a scuffle between the two. Sources said Alagh was stabbed at least two dozen times.Police said the accused was identified and apprehended after an intensive analysis of CCTV footage from over 500 cameras. “He entered the house after cutting the net mesh of the window in the kitchen and break ing the glass,” police said.Police received a call from the victim’s younger son at 9.30am on Monday, informing them about the murder. He told them blood was still oozing from his father’s chest. The murder was discovered when the family’s car cleaner arrived to collect the keys and attempted to open the door. When the victim’s younger son, who was in the next room, opened the door to give the keys to the cleaner, he found his father lying on the floor. Alagh’s elder son owns a restaurant in Hauz Khas, while his younger son is a musician.","Rohit Kumar Alagh, 64, was found dead at his Panchsheel Park home on Monday.

"Social media ban for kids not feasible, but need to promote healthy use, say experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/social-media-ban-for-kids-not-feasible-but-need-to-promote-healthy-use-say-experts/articleshow/115786180.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Should India ban the use of social media among children? With the Australian parliament passing a bill to ban social media use among children under 16, the question has gained a lot of traction. However, experts say, while the decision is well intended, it is difficult to implement.Recently, the American Psychological Association (APA) also issued a health advisory on social media use in adolescence, and it stated that excess or ""problematic social media use"" could impair the ability to engage in daily roles and routines among adolescents. It can also present risk for more serious psychological harms over time, the advisory said.Banning the use of social media among children is a welcome step but it will be difficult to implement a complete ban. ""There is a need for promotion of healthy use,"" Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at AIIMS-Delhi, said.Dr Pramit Rastogi, child and adolescent psychiatrist at STEPS Center for Mental Health, said that the ban proposal captures the reality that children whose minds are not developed enough to have access to and to regulate screen-time are being given these devices without the necessary checks and balances in place.""Having said that, this will run into second order difficulties like development of unregulated and illegal social media channels. We should let the west first go through one iteration of this so that we can learn from it and then introduce the second generation level of social media ban. For example, inability to access mainstream social media on school premises, internet providers offering these parental controls at the provider level rather than individual device level checks and balances, which parents have to do right now,"" he said.According to Dr Roma Kumar, senior consultant psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, widespread access to digital and social media has drastically altered the nature of adolescents' interpersonal connections. ""Depression, anxiety and suicidality have all sharply increased in adolescents over the past decade,"" she said.","Australian parliament passed a bill to ban social media use among children under 16.

Waqf JPC tenure extended amid logjam in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-jpc-tenure-extended-amid-logjam-in-parliament/articleshow/115786140.cms,"The Lower House was first adjourned for an hour soon after it assembled, and later at 12 noon, the Chair adjourned it for the day, after the extension of the JPC's tenure was approved by a voice vote.

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition uproar in Lok Sabha on Thursday, the House extended the tenure of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill till the last day of the Budget session next year. The Bill was earlier listed by the govt for discussion and passage in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.Barring the extension of the JPC's tenure, proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were almost washed out for the third day with opposition members demanding suspension of business to discuss allegations of corruption against the Adani group, the violence in UP's Sambhal and the continuing ethnic strife in Manipur.The Lower House was first adjourned for an hour soon after it assembled, and later at 12 noon, the Chair adjourned it for the day, after the extension of the JPC's tenure was approved by a voice vote.The JPC, headed by BJP's Jagdambika Pal, had reached a consensus to extend the tenure from Nov 29 to the last day of the budget session after opposition MPs walked out of the committee's meeting on Wednesday, when Pal had said the panel's report was ready for tabling in Parliament. While BJP has said the amendments proposed in the Bill will bring transparency and accountability in the functioning of Waqf boards, opposition parties have said they are targeted against the Muslim community and violate its religious rights.As the uproar continued in Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju criticised the opposition members for not letting the House transact business, despite the govt cooperating with them on extending the JPC's tenure and agreeing to hold discussion on other issues. ""I condemn the attempts by Congress and its allies in disrupting House proceedings,"" he said.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs, including from Congress and CPM, had submitted 16 notices for adjournment of scheduled business under Rule 267, but chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected all of them. The Lok Sabha Speaker, too, rejected all adjournment motions moved by the opposition.""Parliamentary disruption is not a remedy, it's a malady. It weakens our foundation. It slides Parliament into irrelevance. The sanctity of this House demands debate, not discord; dialogue, not disruption,"" Dhankhar said. With a vociferous opposition in no mood to relent, he first adjourned Rajya Sabha till 12 noon, and then for the day.","The House extended the tenure of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill till the last day of the Budget session next year.

"BJP: Congress allowed Priyanka oath, then disrupted House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-congress-allowed-priyanka-oath-then-disrupted-house/articleshow/115785670.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP kept up its attack on Congress for opposition's ""opportunistic"" approach towards EVMs, saying the rival cried foul when it lost an election but had no qualms in celebrating its wins in polls conducted through the same EVMs.On a day when Rahul Gandhi travelled to Ranchi to celebrate JMM-led alliance's win in Jharkhand and joined others in welcoming Priyanka Gandhi to Lok Sabha upon her victory in Wayanad, BJP said, ""If they lose, they start crying about EVMs and if they win, Congress celebrates. It's not EVM, it's Congress's intentions that are bad.""Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan slammed Congress for disrupting Parliament while allowing Lok Sabha to function briefly for Priyanka to take oath. ""Congress, which claims to be a great supporter and protector of the Constitution, is actually at the forefront of insulting it. People who are running 'Samvidhan Rakshak Abhiyan' used the temple of democracy (Parliament) to launch Priyanka, a member of the 'royal family'. It is unfortunate that Congress disrupted Parliament immediately after the oath by creating a ruckus,"" Pradhan said, adding that Congress is harming the country and deceiving people in the interest of one family.He also criticised Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge's statement calling for a return to paper ballot elections. He said the late Rajiv Gandhi had objections to ballot papers and accused Congress of a pattern of deflecting responsibility for its defeats. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Kharge could go to "" Mars"" with Rahul and ""live there happily"" if he didn't want EVMs, EC, ED, CBI, judiciary or Modi govt.","BJP attacks Congress for opposition's ""opportunistic"" approach towards EVMs. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan slams Congress for disrupting Parliament.

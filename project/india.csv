NEW DELHI: Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including MPs Mahua Moitra and Derek O’Brien, were detained by Delhi police on Friday while protesting outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence and office.The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids conducted at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics”, highlighting their opposition to the ED action, which they termed politically motivated and aimed at intimidating the party ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections.Speaking to the media during the protest, Mahua Moitra said, “Yesterday, entire India, Bengal witnessed how ED was misused by the Home Ministry. The ED was sent to steal our party's political, strategic information. Mamata Banerjee is a lioness, she protected our party's properties.”TMC MP Kirti Azad added, “They are acting undemocratically; even the raid was illegal. They loot and accuse us of scams. They took away our strategy and candidate lists. BJP’s internal survey shows they won’t get more than 25 seats. But Mamata Banerjee will secure a massive mandate as CM and go on to become the Prime Minister.”The protest comes ahead of a planned march in Delhi led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee will lead the march from Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand to Hazra More at 2 pm to protest the ED raids, news agency PTI reported.The raids at I-PAC offices targeted two locations in Kolkata on Thursday. Apart from providing political consultancy to TMC, I-PAC manages the party’s IT and media operations, making the action sensitive for the party’s electoral preparations.Banerjee visited the I-PAC premises during the ongoing search, accusing the central agency of attempting to seize internal documents, hard disks, and digital data linked to the party’s election strategy.The TMC has described the ED action as politically motivated harassment, intensifying the standoff between the ruling party in West Bengal and the Union government ahead of the assembly elections.",TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics’ The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126427483,imgsize-4232304,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
'Cannot support all his beliefs': Tharoor calls himself 'uncritical fan' of Nehru; slams BJP for turning him into 'convenient scapegoat',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-support-all-his-beliefs-tharoor-calls-himself-uncritical-fan-of-nehru-slams-bjp-for-turning-him-into-convenient-scapegoat/articleshow/126426866.cms,"Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor (PTI file photo)

Nehru Catered To Liaquat Ali Khan, Ignored Somnath History: BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday once again appeared to strike a balanced tone. While expressing respect for the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru , and calling him the founder of Indian democracy, Tharoor also said it was necessary to acknowledge Nehru's mistakes, adding that blaming him alone for India's problems is unjustified.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival (KLIBF), Tharoor spoke on the BJP government's treatment of Nehru's legacy.""I am a fan of Jawaharlal Nehru, but not an uncritical fan. I greatly admire his mind and outlook, and I have deep respect for him, though I cannot support all his beliefs and policies 100%. Many of the things he did deserve the highest appreciation. Most importantly, it was Nehru who firmly established democracy in India... I would not say that they (the Modi government) are anti-democratic, but they are certainly anti-Nehru. Nehru has been turned into a convenient scapegoat,"" he said.Recalling the 1962 India–China war, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""In some cases, their (Modi government's) criticism may have a basis. For instance, the 1962 defeat against China can partly be attributed to some of Nehru’s decisions.""He then turned his focus to the ruling BJP, adding, ""But what they do now is blame Nehru for everything, regardless of the issue.""In recent times, Tharoor's stance and political alignment have come under close scrutiny. Unlike many other party leaders, he does not always adhere to strict partyline statements, often appearing less comfortable with unquestioned loyalty to the Congress high command.Reflecting on his journey as a writer, Tharoor said his love for reading began in childhood due to asthma. With no television or mobile phones, books became his constant companions.He revealed that he wrote his first novel at a very young age, though it was later lost to an ink spillage. His biography of Sree Narayana Guru marks his 28th book.Tharoor also mentioned that while reading habits are declining globally, Kerala continues to lead in reading culture. He said he wrote ""The Great Indian Novel"" in 1989 as a satirical work, a genre that was largely absent in India at the time.Addressing the younger generation, Tharoor suggested that shorter books with fewer pages may be more appealing to readers who struggle to find time. He also fondly recalled his college days at St Stephen’s College, Delhi, remembering a stage production where he played Antony while filmmaker Mira Nair portrayed Cleopatra.","Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor spoke at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival.

High Court: Neighbour can’t be dragged into dowry case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-neighbour-cant-be-dragged-into-dowry-case/articleshow/126425510.cms,".

BENGALURU: Neighbours cannot be casually dragged into dowry harassment cases, Karnataka high court has held, quashing criminal proceedings against a Bengaluru woman caught in a matrimonial dispute between a couple in her neighbourhood.“A stranger cannot be drawn into the proceedings for offences under Section 498A of IPC, between the husband, wife or family members,” Justice M Nagaprasanna observed, granting relief to Asha G.The case arose from a complaint lodged on Feb 13, 2021, at Mahalakshmi Layout police station, in which Munirathnamma accused her husband, Muthuram, his family and neighbour Asha of cruelty and harassment. Police registered a case under IPC sections 498A, 504, 506 and 323 and later filed a chargesheet naming Asha as accused no. 5, alleging she had instigated Munirathnamma’s husband to torture her.Challenging the proceedings, Asha contended that she had no role whatsoever in the matrimonial life of the complainant and she was “only a neighbour”. She argued that the lone allegation of instigation was insufficient to rope her into a dowry harassment case, and that she had been arraigned as an accused because of an “axe to grind”.Munirathnamma maintained that Asha was the “reason” for her husband’s behaviour and should therefore face trial.However, Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the petitioner’s name surfaced “nowhere except for the contention that she instigated the husband to torture the wife”. The court held Asha did not fall within the definition of “family” as contemplated under Section 498A.","The case arose from a complaint lodged on Feb 13, 2021, at Mahalakshmi Layout police station.

Rs 2k crore scam during Covid in Rajasthan noon meal scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2k-crore-scam-during-covid-in-rajasthan-noon-meal-scheme/articleshow/126425449.cms,".

JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s anticorruption bureau (ACB) Thursday registered a case in an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.ACB officers said the FIR names 21 accused, including officials of Rajasthan State Cooperative Consumer Federation Ltd (Confed), representatives of private firms and suppliers, who have been booked on charges of criminal conspiracy, forgery and misuse of govt funds.According to ACB, when schools were closed during the pandemic, a decision was taken that packs containing pulses, oil, spices and other essentials would be supplied through Confed under the midday meal scheme. The material was to be supplied in accordance with FSSAI and Agmark standards, with doorstep delivery to students across the state.Following complaints of large-scale irregularities in 2020-21, ACB registered a preliminary inquiry. Officers said it revealed officials conspired to rig the tender process by tweaking the eligibility norms. As a result, qualified firms were kept out of the bidding process, ensuring contracts were cornered by favoured companies.These firms allegedly further sublet the work to shell entities, creating a fake supply chain of non-existent suppliers and transporters, with little or no actual procurement or delivery.The investigation also found that in several cases, fake bills were generated and submitted without any actual purchase or supply, and govt payments obtained on the basis of bogus and inflated invoicing. In many cases, it is suspected substandard materials were supplied, but falsely certified as meeting prescribed quality and safety norms.A financial loss of about Rs 2,000 crore was estimated to have been caused to the state exchequer, ACB said. Based on the findings, an FIR was registered against Confed officials, central warehouse staff, private individuals and firms involved.","Rajasthan's anticorruption bureau (ACB) Thursday registered a case in an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.

DU bids adieu to wall of democracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/du-bids-adieu-to-wall-of-democracy/articleshow/126424902.cms,".

NEW DELHI: 'Bol ke lab azaad hain tere,' scribbled across a yellow chart paper, fought for space alongside a poster exhorting freshers to join the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. During the high-decibel Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) polls in Sept, the walls of democracy at North Campus gave opposing student parties the opportunity to stand neck-and-neck-at least on paper-and more.On Wednesday evening, however, when two women students affiliated with the Students' Federation of India (SFI) attempted to paste posters opposing the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill near St. Stephen's College, they were shocked to learn that the walls no longer 'existed'.A video shows at least seven security staff stopping the duo.Only five months ago, Delhi University (DU) had notified guidelines against defacement of walls, especially during the student election season. It also asked departments and colleges to increase the size of these walls of democracy as much as possible at two notified locations.DU's North and South Campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'Wall of Democracy' for easy identification.Walls adjacent to St. Stephen's College, near the Faculty of Arts, and opposite Daulat Ram College were among those officially designated.During student elections, anti-defacement committees were set up to ensure that posters were pasted only on these walls. Outside election periods, students have also used them to display posters related to protests, meetings and political or social issues.In a social media post, the student body alleged that the guards tore down the posters and verbally informed them of the university's decision. Students also claimed that the boards identifying these walls were removed without prior notice.DU proctor Manoj Kumar on Thursday confirmed that the walls had been denotified. He, however, did not provide any reason for the decision or indicate whether it had been communicated to students. He also did not clarify whether colleges had been asked to follow suit. A college principal said no one had asked them to follow in the university's footsteps, so far.The organisation submitted a complaint to the proctor's office on Thursday, demanding the immediate reinstatement of the walls.In its complaint, the SFI said the removal was carried out without any consultation with students or student organisations. It added that the walls have historically served as an important democratic space for students to express opinions and engage in political and social dialogue within the university.Calling the move an attempt to stifle democratic expression, students said the shrinking of such spaces undermines the democratic character of DU.","DU's North and South Campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'Wall of Democracy' for easy identification.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

End Of H-1B Lottery: Donald Trump Overhauls US Work Visa System Prioritising High Pay And Skills

Court backs broad presidential authority

Agencies followed binding directive

Legal challenges continue

A federal district court has ruled that President Donald Trump acted within his legal authority when he ordered employers to pay an additional $100,000 fee before new H-1B visas can be processed, affirming the administration’s power under immigration law.The decision rejected claims from business and higher education groups that the proclamation exceeded presidential authority, concluding that the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the president wide discretion to restrict the entry of noncitizens when deemed necessary.In Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. US Department of Homeland Security, the judge held that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains “exceedingly broad language” allowing the president to impose such measures, a phrase quoted by the Higher Ed Dive. The ruling found that Trump legitimately exercised his authority when issuing the proclamation requiring the additional payment from employers seeking new H-1B visas.The judge stated that Trump supported the proclamation with evidence that the H-1B programme was being abused, harming American workers and creating national security concerns, according to the Higher Ed Dive. While acknowledging the economic contributions of H-1B workers, the court said the broader policy debate fell outside its role.The lawsuit was brought by the Association of American Universities and the Chamber of Commerce, a business federation representing around 300,000 members. They argued that the president acted ultra vires under the INA and that the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department implemented the proclamation without proper notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.The judge rejected both arguments, writing that federal agencies “plainly do not act ‘arbitrarily and capriciously’” when implementing a lawful presidential directive, words quoted by the Higher Ed Dive. She added that the agencies “had no other course of action” and could not disregard a binding order, in conversation with the Higher Ed Dive.The ruling marked the first decision among at least three lawsuits challenging the proclamation. Another case, California v. Noem, was filed by 20 state attorneys general from mainly Democratic states. Following the decision, the Association of American Universities and the Chamber filed a notice of appeal.Reacting to the outcome, Chamber Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel Daryl Joseffer said the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, he told the Higher Ed Dive. He said the Chamber was disappointed and was considering further legal options to ensure the programme operates as Congress intended, allowing businesses to access global talent, Joseffer added to the Higher Ed Dive. The appeal process is now expected to proceed.","US court upholds Trump authority to impose $100,000 H-1B employer fee.

500% tariffs ahead for India & China?

Also read:

Also read:

US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products. The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that ""knowingly engage in the exchange. "" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations “who buy cheap Russian oil,” a move that could directly impact India’s energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington.The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government.The bill states that Trump ""must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.""In his post on X, Graham said, ""After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others."" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, ""Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.""""This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine.""Earlier this week, Graham said that India was urging Washington to roll back steep tariffs imposed in August 2025, over the same issue. Graham claimed that India’s ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhi’s reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, “I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff.” The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that India’s energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%.Trump has openly acknowledged that the tariffs have strained ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing the House GOP Member Retreat, he said PM Modi was unhappy with the trade measures but pointed to a reduction in oil imports from Russia. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said.The US President has repeatedly warned India that tariffs could be increased further if it does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly linking trade pressure to the Russia–Ukraine conflict. He has argued that India’s purchases of discounted Russian crude fuel Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.India, however, has maintained a firm stance, rejecting Trump’s earlier claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place. As Washington moves closer to advancing the sanctions bill, the proposed legislation could raise fresh uncertainty for India.At the same time, Trump has positioned himself as a potential broker in the Russia–Ukraine war, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough so far.","US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in India to temporarily suspend visa services.

Key symptoms of lung cancer you must pay attention to

NEW DELHI: India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030, with the North-East emerging as the worst-affected region and women recording the fastest increase in cases, a national study published in Indian Journal of Medical Research has found.Data from 57 populations across six regions show lung cancer incidence to be highest in the North-East, where rates for women are now close to those for men - an unusual pattern in India. Aizawl recorded the highest burden, with age-standardised incidence at 35.9 per lakh among men and 33.7 per lakh among women, along with the highest mortality.Although extremely high tobacco use - over 68% among men and 54% among women - continues to drive the region's burden, doctors say the disease profile is shifting. ""We are seeing more lung cancer cases among non-smoking women, linked to indoor air pollution, biomass fuel use, second-hand smoke and occupational exposure,"" said Dr Saurabh Mittal of AIIMS's pulmonology department.The shift is also reflected in tumour patterns nationwide. Adenocarcinoma has replaced smoking-linked squamous-cell carcinoma as the dominant subtype. In Bengaluru, it now accounts for over half of lung cancer cases among women, while Delhi has seen a sharp rise in large-cell carcinoma.Southern districts such as Kannur, Kasargod and Kollam reported high incidence among men despite relatively low tobacco and alcohol use, pointing to non-tobacco risk factors. Among women, Hyderabad and Bengaluru recorded the highest incidence in the south. In the north, Srinagar showed elevated lung cancer rates among men, while women in Srinagar and Pulwama also reported higher incidence despite low substance use.Trend analysis shows lung cancer incidence climbing by up to 6.7% annually among women and 4.3% among men in some regions. Thiruvananthapuram recorded the sharpest rise among women, while Dindigul saw the steepest increase among men. With tobacco use among women still below 10% nationwide, researchers point to worsening air quality and household exposures as key drivers.Projections suggest that by 2030, lung cancer incidence among men could exceed 33 per lakh in parts of Kerala, while among women it could rise to over 8 per lakh in cities like Bengaluru. Low mortality-to-incidence ratios in several regions also point to gaps in death reporting, potentially masking the true toll.",India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030.

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Nodal Cyber Police on Wednesday filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a Rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused, who not only impersonated Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers, but also created a multi-layered web of mule bank accounts to move money across states and eventually overseas.According to the chargesheet, the investigation uncovered over 10,000 mule accounts, many opened in the names of fictitious companies using forged KYC documents and fake SIM cards. The funds allegedly travelled through 13 layers of accounts, including at least 27 active mule accounts in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, before being diverted abroad. The masterminds are suspected to be operating from Cambodia and Dubai, with one Vijay Khanna emerging as a key handler believed to be outside India.The fraud began in Aug 2025, when a pharmaceutical businessman and his wife were allegedly terrorised through calls and video interactions by persons posing as CBI and ED officials. The couple was told that their bank accounts had received ""suspicious"" funds attracting money-laundering provisions and were shown fake video calls and staged clips depicting police stations, CBI and ED offices, and even mock courtrooms with actors posing as judges, officers, and lawyers.Under the guise of investigation, the couple was coerced to transfer their entire savings of over Rs 58.1 crore, with assurances the money would be returned after clearance.Investigators said arrested Gujarat businessman Jayeshbhai Dapa's firm, Jai Bhavani Mechanical, allegedly received nearly Rs 15.3 crore, which was then routed to multiple accounts for monetary consideration. Accounts in the names of Meghdoot Trading, owned by Sakalkumar Sahu, Jacky Explorer owned by Chirag Sharma, and entities such as SBV Foundation and M-Stak Innovation allegedly received major sums, ranging from Rs 1.9 crore to Rs 2.4 crore.Devendranath Raut, a resident of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, allegedly received Rs 2.1 crore in the name of Sainath Enterprises and stated, during interrogation, that he transferred funds at the behest of a wanted accused, Shratik. Investigators have also tracked Rs 3.4 crore allegedly transferred to accounts linked with wanted accused Vijay Gaikwad, Abhijit Jamble, and Ratnadeep.The chargesheet alleged that AVB Foundation, owned by Akshay Meena of Bhilwara, received Rs 30 lakh, while Maybank Indonesia accounts linked to Technomist Softwares and Arkit Solutions and opened by Devendra alias Sunny and Mukesh Bhatia received Rs 50 lakh. Accused Katunga Raju Samuel Prasad from Andhra Pradesh allegedly received Rs 2.4 crore through an account in the name of a religious trust.","The Maharashtra Nodal Cyber Police on Wednesday filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a Rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused.

Sawaal poochhne ka waqt kab ka nikal chuka hai.

History might disagree, at least in the cinematic verse. Everything repeats, and the return of angry young men on screen is one such phenomena. And so is the hyper nationalistic movies.Half a century ago, that line fromdidn’t just earn applause — it gave voice to a generation’s anger. Today, that anger is back in Indian cinema, louder, bloodier and far more profitable. Withstorming the box office and rewriting records week after week, the return of the angry young man is no longer a creative coincidence. It is a cultural moment. But this time, the anger isn’t quite pointing in the same direction.Released on December 5,has only begun to slow down in its fifth week after a month-long, record-breaking run. The Ranveer Singh-led film, featuring Arjun Rampal, R Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt and Akshaye Khanna, has crossed the lifetime collections ofand. It has stayed remarkably strong despite competition from Hollywood spectacleand Hindi releases such asand. Its success is not just about scale or star power — it signals how deeply the angry male protagonist has re-entered the mainstream imagination.From here, Indian cinema’s relationship with anger, power and masculinity tells a story that is as political as it is cinematic.The template was set in the 1970s against the backdrop of Emergency. In, Amitabh Bachchan’s Vijay Khanna tells the system exactly where it stands. In, when asked to choose between law and loyalty, he delivers one of Hindi cinema’s most enduring lines: “Mere paas maa hai.” It wasn’t bravado. It was a moral position.The angry young man of that era was shaped by a country struggling with inflation, unemployment, labour unrest and widespread corruption. Films like(1975),(1979) and(1981) were steeped in a sense of betrayal. The state had promised dignity and justice; instead, it delivered scarcity and indifference.These protagonists were anti-establishment by design. They didn’t trust institutions because institutions had failed them. When Bachchan growled, “Aaj khush toh bahut hoge tum,” it was a class confrontation. Film scholars often describe this phase using Antonio Gramsci’s idea of counter-hegemony: cinema became a site where the working class could symbolically push back against dominant power structures.Violence existed, but it was rarely celebratory. The angry young man was tragic, burdened by his choices, aware that justice came at a cost.Fast forward to the last decade, and the angry man is back—bigger, louder and more commercially potent than ever. Films likeandhave drawn massive audiences across languages.But listen closely to what these men are angry about.In, the protagonist declares, “Jo mera nahi ho sakta, woh kisi aur ka bhi nahi ho sakta.” His rage isn’t directed at a broken system but at a woman who refuses to conform. In, Ranbir Kapoor’s character boasts, “Papa ke liye main kuch bhi kar sakta hoon,” as familial obsession morphs into unchecked violence. The films don’t question these impulses—they aestheticise them.Even in, when Allu Arjun swaggers through the forest declaring, “Pushpa naam sunke flower samjhe kya? Fire hai main,” the line captures the shift. Pushpa doesn’t dismantle corruption; he perfects it. His rebellion is not against power, but against exclusion from power.Similarly,’s Rocky doesn’t dream of reform. He dreams of domination. His worldview is summed up in the idea that power must be seized and held at any cost, not questioned or redistributed.This is the crucial difference between the angry men of the 1970s and today. Earlier heroes fought corrupt systems because those systems denied dignity. Today’s heroes often aspire to control the system itself.Film theory helps explain this turn. Where earlier cinema channelled collective anger, contemporary films reflect a more individualistic worldview. Neoliberal masculinity—where success is personal, dominance is virtue, and empathy is weakness—has found a powerful visual language in popular cinema.The audience response is telling. Viewers cheer not because the hero questions authority, but because he exercises it without restraint. Anger has shifted from resistance to entitlement.Running parallel to this trend is the rise of overtly pro-state films. Titles such asandhave framed the state as decisive, morally upright and beyond scrutiny.In, the line “How’s the josh?” became a national catchphrase—not of protest, but of affirmation. The cinema of anger, once suspicious of power, now often works in sync with it.Political communication scholars note that popular culture doesn’t merely mirror public sentiment—it helps shape it. When rage is directed outward at designated enemies rather than upward at systems of power, it reinforces the status quo rather than challenging it.Since Dhurandhar divided people over whether to appreciate the filmmaking of it or criticise the propaganda of it, Hindi film industry actor Hrithik Roshan put it the right way: “I may disagree with the politics of it, and argue about the responsibilities us filmmakers should bear as citizens of the world. Nevertheless, can’t ignore how I loved and learnt from this one as a student of cinema. Amazing.”Andhadhun actor Radhika Apte too, recently expressed concern over the rise in violence in Indian cinema.""I'm deeply disturbed by the violence at the moment that is selling as entertainment,"" said Apte in an interview with the Hollywood reporter. She did not shy away from calling out violence against women in films.""I find it disturbing that actresses are doing films that demean women,"" she said, calling for collective responsibility. ""I think we need to collectively stop doing them. They might be throwing money at you, but you're rich already. We need to stop because this is very harmful.""The angry men are back. They dominate box office charts, shape popular culture and command extraordinary influence. But unlike their predecessors, they no longer ask uncomfortable questions of power.The angry young man of the 1970s emerged from social fracture and spoke to collective injustice. Today’s angry man thrives on certainty—certain of his right to control, to punish, to dominate. His rage does not unsettle the system; it often reinforces it.Ascontinues its theatrical run, it prompts a larger question for Indian cinema: Is this a revival of rebellion, or has authority simply been repackaged in the language of anger?Well, Naseeruddin Shah's character inputs it right:","Released on December 5, has only begun to slow down in its fifth week after a month-long, record-breaking run. The Ranveer Singh-led film, featuring Arjun Rampal, R Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt and Akshaye Khanna, has crossed the lifetime collections ofand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126415870,imgsize-997117,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday assured that the first batch of 50 students selected for admission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi would not be allowed to suffer because of NMC’s withdrawal of permission to run the MBBS course. The government would accommodate the students in other institutions through supernumerary seats, he said.“We will adjust them by creating supernumerary seats in colleges close to their homes so that their education does not suffer,” the CM told media persons on the sidelines of a function in Jammu. It was the govt’s responsibility to accommodate the students, he said, adding that this was not a difficult task and had been “discussed thoroughly”.Supernumerary seats are additional seats created over and above the approved intake in an educational institute.Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti against 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, being granted admission to the Jammu-based medical institute funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, as against only seven Hindus. He reiterated that the students got admission on merit as the selections were based on NEET scores.The NMC order on withdrawal of permission cited SMVDIME’s non-adherence to minimum standards as the reason. In a reference to that, Omar said accountability must be fixed if standards were not maintained at the medical institute. “We will accommodate these 50 students, but someone must answer for the damage done to students’ futures,” he said.Responding to questions on inspections by NMC and the medical college’s non-compliance with norms, he said: “You should question the university and its office-bearers from top to bottom — why, after building a medical college, did it fail to pass inspection?”The CM also interacted with the J&K Under-16 cricket team that clinched the Vijay Merchant Trophy (Plate Group) for the first time. Congratulating the team on their remarkable feat, he said, “Your victory reflects not just talent, but teamwork, discipline and dedication. You have made the entire J&K proud.”Omar presented an appreciation trophy to the victorious team, led by Smagey Khajuria. J&K defeated Mizoram by an innings and 182 runs to lift the trophy in Surat on Jan 6.","Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti against 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, being granted admission to the Jammu-based medical institute.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: TMC and I-PAC moved Calcutta high court Thursday challenging the legality of ED searches at the political consultancy's chief Pratik Jain's residence and the group's office, setting up a face-off with the agency that also approached the same bench alleging obstruction.According to details available on HC's website, TMC's petition names Union govt, ED and I-PAC as respondents. Sources said TMC has raised concerns over alleged access to party's confidential material linked to special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, including information on booth-level agents, and documents connected to preparations for the 2026 Bengal polls.ED searched Jain's home on Loudon Street near central Kolkata's Park Street and I-PAC's office in Sector V, the city's IT hub in Salt Lake on the eastern fringe. The searches were linked to an alleged coal scam. Tension flared outside Jain's home when central forces accompanying ED allegedly asked personnel from Shakespeare Sarani police station - which covers the Park Street area - to remain outside the main gate. A verbal confrontation followed.Shakespeare Sarani police is preparing to register a suo motu case against ED and CRPF, alleging obstruction of police work.Jain's family is also considering a separate complaint, alleging family members were forcibly detained and that ED entered private areas without notice.Another suo motu case is being considered by Electronic Complex police station, which has jurisdiction over Sector V, alleging ED did not inform local police before the operation at I-PAC's office. ED has criticised Kolkata police for what it described as ""overactivity"".The court battle unfolds against the backdrop of TMC's long-running and electorally successful association with I-PAC that began in 2019. Over the next six-and-a-half years, TMC recorded a 100% strike rate with I-PAC on board, sweeping the 2021 assembly elections, winning the 2023 panchayat polls and retaining dominance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Bengal.After the 2021 assembly polls, Kishor exited to pursue his own political plans, but I-PAC stayed on.","TMC and I-PAC moved Calcutta high court Thursday challenging legality of ED searches.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) is not fully satisfied with X's initial response to its notice on the alleged misuse of AI chatbot Grok and is likely to seek clearer, step-by-step details on corrective measures the platform plans to implement, govt sources said on Thursday.Officials said X's reply to the Jan 2 notice had relied on broad assurances of policy enforcement and user liability but fell short of spelling out specific technological and operational safeguards to prevent generation of obscene and non-consensual content, including sexualised images of women and minors. ""The response is generic in nature. The ministry is going to ask for specific steps - what changes will be made, how quickly and how they will be enforced,"" a source said.The development comes after X sought more days beyond the 72-hour deadline set by MeitY to submit a detailed action taken report"". A govt official had earlier told TOI the platform requested additional time and govt remained ""hopeful of a positive outcome"" given X's global footprint.The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using Grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images by feeding publicly available photos into the chatbot. A Reuters report last week said the platform was flooded with such content, raising concerns over AI-enabled abuse.Amid the scrutiny, X owner Elon Musk warned that users generating illegal content through Grok would face consequences. MeitY has said failure to comply with directives could lead to the withdrawal of safe-harbour protections.","The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using Grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking in what it called an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world's second National Environmental Standard Laboratory (NESL) here at the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries in Europe or the US.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR-NPL scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The NESL, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR-NPL - the apex institution for metrology and custodian of India's national standards - Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.The difference in temperature, humidity, pollution mix and high dust load due to difference in environmental or weather conditions of certifying countries often affected the long-term reliability and transparency of the data generated in India.The NESL will, however, allow manufacturers, industries, and municipal agencies to validate performance within the country, ensuring credible data for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), industrial emission audits, and smart-city monitoring networks.","India has set up the world's second National Environmental Standard Laboratory (NESL) The NESL will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment.

Pre-Poll Shock In Bengal As ED Raids I-PAC Office, CM Mamata Calls It Political Targeting By Centre

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Thursday accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation, claiming that search operations were conducted “in a peaceful and professional manner till the arrival of the Bengal CM” along with senior state police officials.In a statement, the ED said it was carrying out searches at 10 premises, six in West Bengal and four in Delhi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with an alleged coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee.The ED alleged that proceedings were disrupted after Banerjee arrived at the residence of Pratik Jain, the I-PAC chief, accompanied by a large number of police personnel. “Mamata Banerjee entered the residential premises of Prateek Jain and took away key evidences including physical documents and electronic devices,” the agency said. It further claimed that the chief minister’s convoy then moved to I-PAC’s office, from where “Banerjee, her aides, and state police personnel forcibly removed physical documents and electronic evidences”.The agency said the investigation had uncovered links between the coal smuggling network and hawala operators, with proceeds of crime running into tens of crores of rupees. One such hawala operator, the ED claimed, had facilitated transactions to Indrapac Consulting Private Limited (I-PAC), a political consultancy firm associated with the Trinamool Congress.According to the ED, these actions resulted in obstruction of an ongoing investigation. The agency insisted that the searches were evidence-based, not targeted at any political establishment, and unrelated to elections. “No party office has been searched,” it said, adding that the operation was part of a routine crackdown on money laundering and conducted strictly in accordance with legal safeguards.Earlier, Banerjee rejected the allegations and accused the central agency of attempting to seize the TMC’s internal documents and election strategy. Speaking to reporters after visiting Jain’s residence and the I-PAC office in Salt Lake, she said ED officials were confiscating party documents, hard disks, laptops and mobile phones containing sensitive political data. “Is it the duty of the ED to collect political party data?” she asked, describing the searches as politically motivated and unconstitutional.Launching a sharp attack on the BJP leadership, Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of misusing central agencies to intimidate opposition parties. She alleged that the raid amounted to “political vendetta” and claimed the ED had begun searches early in the morning when no one was present at the office, allowing officials to access and copy election-related data.Speaking at a gatheringj later, the West Bengal CM said the truth would eventually prevail.""Truth will prevail; we will not interfere. But look at the BJP's conduct when we face them in a political manner,"" she said.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh led party workers and leaders in a protest in Kolkata.","The Enforcement Directorate accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

NEW DELHI: Pushing for expansion of NDA in Tamil Nadu, BJP is crafting a high-pitched campaign to position the alliance as a natural choice for anti-DMK voters amid emergence of actor Vijay-led TVK as the third force in the state's traditionally bipolar politics.AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami's meeting with home minister Amit Shah, a keen votary of widening the NDA tent in the poll-bound state, on Wednesday covered a range of issues related to the alliance's growth and agenda.That the PMK faction led by Anbumani Ramadoss was welcomed into NDA by EPS, as Palaniswami is commonly known, in Chennai hours before he met Shah in Delhi was as much about timing as about consolidating the alliance.However, EPS, the declared leader of NDA, has drawn a red line on including O Panneerselvam and Sasikala back into AIADMK or the alliance. In comments to media on Thursday, he reiterated his stand against them but offered no direct answer on TTV Dhinakaran, another former AIADMK functionary being spoken of as a prospective NDA member.BJP has long been of the view that the return of those once associated with AIADMK and its late leader J Jayalalithaa will send out a message of unity after the reverses it has suffered in elections.However, people familiar with the issue said BJP will ultimately go with EPS as it has already named him as leader of the alliance and believes an AIADMK-led front remains the best bet to defeat the DMK-Congress-Left combine.What has thrown up an imponderable in the poll equation is the emergence of TVK, which has gained in attraction for local satraps disaffected with their parent party or drawn by higher profiles on offer.With AIADMK under EPS ceding some space over the years, some functionaries have crossed over to TVK amid buzz that Panneerselvam and Dhinakaran may also move to the new outfit.A BJP functionary likened the attention and crowds Vijay is drawing to the buzz poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor had generated in Bihar, before his party came a cropper in the polls.Sources added that BJP would like to bring together all political forces, including TVK, opposed to the DMK-led front, but Vijay's projection of himself as the CM candidate and criticism of BJP's ideology have made such a prospect improbable. In fact, TVK has called Congress a natural ally amid a section of the national party openly indicating their unhappiness with DMK's refusal to share power and warm up to TVK.With issues far from settled in the state's governing alliance, NDA is planning to tie up the loose ends and shape the poll agenda by building a high-octane campaign around alleged corruption and misgovernance.",BJP is crafting a high-pitched campaign to position the alliance as a natural choice for anti-DMK voters in Tamil Nadu.

No red lights in Kota: When cities try out signal-free roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-red-lights-in-kota-when-cities-try-out-signal-free-roads/articleshow/126424548.cms,".

Signal-free roads have led to drop in accidents and fatalities, say police

At a junction on Anna Salai in Chennai, a car edges past the spot where a traffic light once hung, slows down, curves into a U-turn and merges back without stopping. Almost 1700km away, in Bokaro, drivers approach roundabouts that have never needed signals at all, easing off instinctively. In Kota, the same idea of uninterrupted flow often collapses into peak-hour gridlock, forced detours and sudden bottlenecks.India's experiments with signal-free roads may not have succeeded universally but have left deeper lessons on traffic management and human behaviour.Kota's attempt was the most sweeping. Under the Smart City Project, it dismantled traffic signals in Dec 2022, spending over Rs 2,000cr from the Rs 5,000cr programme to build more than two dozen overbridges, as many underpasses and multiple slip lanes. At least 12 major junctions were widened and redesigned to eliminate stopping altogether. The redesign drew attention beyond the city too, with industrialist Anand Mahindra among those who appreciated the concept - an endorsement residents now cite as proof the idea was never dismissed as impractical, only difficult to execute at scale.""It's the only traffic signal-free city of nearly 15 lakh people,"" said RD Meena, former officer on special duty of then Kota Urban Improvement Trust, now Kota Development Authority, who supervised the project.RD Meena, former officer on special duty of then Kota Urban Improvement Trust and now Kota Development Authority who supervised the project, said the overhaul was completed in three years despite time and financial constraints, and that ""the changes were made with public consensus"".Immediately, long waits at major circles eased, and 10-15 minute snarls at places like Commerce College Road, Gumanpura and Sabzi Mandi thinned out. But the city's ""no-stop"" layout also produced new stresses. Trips that once required a simple right turn now involve longer loops. During peak hours, congestion resurfaces at redesigned junctions, while drivers cut through narrow link roads to save time, increasing side-swipes and wrong-side conflicts.The strain is most visible along the Commerce College-Airport Road stretch, where ambulances and vehicles parked outside private hospitals routinely narrow down moving lanes. What is designed as free flow breaks down when stationary traffic intrudes.""Travel time hasn't really come down,"" said Sujeet Swami, a Kota-based advocate. ""At peak hours, congestion becomes unbearable at Commerce College Circle, Kotdi, Antaghar, Chawani, Gumanpura and Keshavpura. Without signals or cops managing the rush, jams just stack up.""Traffic police counter with enforcement data. Deputy SP (Traffic) Ashok Meena said the city adopted a 'no-stop' policy for violators, moving away from roadside confrontations that happened when drivers were stopped on the road. Instead, officials moved to digital monitoring using night-vision laser speed guns, interceptor vehicles and static cameras linked to Abhay Command Centre. Till Nov 2025, over 8,000 speed violations and more than 1,000 cases of wrong-side driving were recorded digitally. A black-spot audit improved 57 of the 76 accident-prone locations.""Accidents have dropped from 556 in 2023 to 358 by late 2025. Fatalities are down about 20%,"" Meena said, adding the model could work in other cities under right conditions. Police data shows that in 2023, Kota recorded 556 road mishaps, with 103 deaths and 604 injured; in 2024, mishaps fell to 458, with 104 deaths and 494 injured; and till Nov 30, 2025, mishaps stood at 358, with 83 deaths and 417 injured.As of July 31, 2025, Kota had over 7 lakh registered vehicles - including around 5.2 lakh two-wheelers - policed by a traffic force of just over 100 personnel, supported by 30 home guards. Urban planners point out that the city's mixed results reflect a tightening equation between road width and vehicle load, one that becomes harder to balance as traffic grows.Bokaro presents a quieter contrast. Developed in the 1970s as a planned township, Bokaro Steel City has functioned without traffic signals, surveillance cameras or constant policing for years. Wide roads and three-arm roundabouts keep movement predictable, and the city's largest junction, Birsa Chowk, is the only four-way intersection - also signal-free. ""Driving here feels easy,"" said Kirti Kumari, a college student who rides a scooty daily. ""There's space, no pressure, and no sudden stops.""Deputy commissioner Ajay Nath Jha said the township's road design shaped behaviour as much as enforcement. ""There's a unique and effective traffic culture. Wide roads, roundabouts and road bumps play an important role in making driving safer,"" he said. ""We are moving Bokaro towards a 'zero accident' goal, and all departments concerned work with seriousness, sensitivity and strong coordination.""Roads inside the township are maintained by Bokaro Steel Plant. ""The layout was planned from the start - wide carriageways, roundabouts, regular upkeep,"" said Manikant Dhan, the PSU's chief of communication. ""That reduces congestion and accidents.""Down south, Chennai's signal-free experiment occupies a narrower, more controlled space. In mid-2023, Greater Chennai Traffic Police removed signals at six junctions along Anna Salai, including Nandanam, Spencer's and Teynampet, replacing right turns with straight movement, designated U-turns and left turns. Average delays fell from over 12 minutes to under five, while speeds on the six-km stretch between Saidapet and Spencer's Signal rose from about 10 kmph in 2022 to around 14 kmph.Instead of permanent concrete channelisers, Chennai used removable barricades, allowing quick corrections. Some motorists complained that barricades ate into up to two-and-a-half lanes on four-lane roads, affecting opposing traffic. Police said designs were reviewed and adjusted.Chennai also adopted a corridor approach rather than isolated junction fixes. On 100 Feet Road between Koyambedu and Vadapalani, three signals were shut together and replaced with two double U-turns, enabling continuous movement along the stretch. The model has since extended to EVR Periyar Salai, Old Mahabalipuram Road and the CPT junction. Chennai now has nearly 36 such U-turns, deployed selectively rather than citywide.Across the three cities, the pattern is hard to miss. Signal-free roads work when space, design and behaviour align, or when interventions are limited, data-driven and reversible. Where those conditions thin out, uninterrupted movement becomes another source of friction. The red light was never the real constraint. The city itself was.","India's experiments with signal-free roads have left deeper lessons on traffic management and human behaviour. In Kota, the same idea of uninterrupted flow often collapses into peak-hour gridlock, forced detours and sudden bottlenecks. In Bokaro, drivers approach roundabouts that have never needed signals at all, easing off instinctively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126424546,imgsize-615300,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-18.jpg"

Delhi: 5 Cops Injured, 10 Detained As Anti-Encroachment Drive Near Mosque Turns Violent

It is being imposed for years of encroachment and losses to the ecological system. In the past one year, we recovered dozens of ponds on which constructions were made.

Donald Trump Pulls US Out Of India-Led Solar Alliance In Sweeping Exit From 66 Global Agencies

US move coincides with call for defence budget rise





In a sweeping overhaul of America's global footprint, President Donald Trump has authorised the withdrawal of US from 66 international organisations, marking one of the most significant retreats from multilateralism in modern history.The pullout is from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though the withdrawal from ISA, a collaborative initiative of India and France to increase solar footprints globally, will not affect the alliance's key goal, the move came as a surprise as the Trump administration had never hinted at it after withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change.The withdrawal, announced on Jan 7 via a presidential memorandum, affects 31 United Nations entities and 35 non-UN groups, including key bodies focused on health and education. This action coincides with Trump's call for a $1.5 trillion defence budget in fiscal year 2027, a staggering 50% increase over current levels, fuelling debates about a shift towards a ""Fortress America"" doctrine that prioritises domestic strength, protectionism over global engagement.The withdrawals build on an executive order issued shortly after Trump's inauguration in Jan 2025, which directed a review of US participation in international bodies deemed contrary to national interests. Prominent targets include Unesco, which the US had briefly rejoined under the previous administration; and potentially WHO, echoing Trump's first-term defunding over alleged biases toward China.Other entities span trade, human rights, and environmental forums, with the state department citing a total of 66 as ""wasteful, ineffective, or harmful"". In some cases, Washington has formally withdrawn; in others, it has suspended funding, reduced diplomatic engagement or signalled an intention to exit when legal timelines allow.Administration officials say these organisations ""no longer serve American interests"" and often promote policies seen as hostile or inefficient. For instance, climate-related bodies are criticised for imposing undue burdens on US business and industry without reciprocal commitments from ""major emitters"" like China and India, even though their per capita emission is a fraction of American emissions. Unesco and similar groups face accusations of waste and mismanagement, with secretary of state Marco Rubio highlighting redundancy and a lack of tangible benefits for US taxpayers.Trump himself has framed the decisions as part of his ""America First"" agenda, arguing that funds previously allocated to these entities - estimated at billions annually - should be redirected domestically to address border security, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Supporters, including Republican lawmakers, applaud the move as a correction to decades of overcommitment, freeing resources amid a national debt heading towards $40 trillion.Foreign policy experts point to the Dec 2025 National Security Strategy, which critiques US allies in Europe and Asia for insufficient burden-sharing while prioritising unilateral actions. The document, released under Trump's direction, describes an ""America First"" framework that sceptics label as neo-isolationist, though administration officials insist it avoids outright withdrawal from core alliances like Nato, which is also under siege from Washington over the Greenland issue.This approach is straining US ties across the globe: European leaders have decried the US exits as a blow to collective security, while adversaries like Russia and China are relishing the perceived vacuum. Partners like India, Japan, and Australia have been hung out to dry. Analysts argue the policy fosters adversity by undermining multilateralism, with some of them warning that Trump's strategy risks damaging US power, economy, and security through hostility toward global cooperation.The proposed $1.5 trillion defence budget, unveiled on Jan 7, underscores this pivot. Trump justified the hike - up from the current $1 trillion - as essential for building a ""dream military"", with allocations for nuclear modernisation, missile defence, and cyber capabilities.","US withdraws from 66 international organisations, including UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Solar Alliance.

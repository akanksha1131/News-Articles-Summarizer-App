Breaching 1.5 degree C temp. rise threshold doesn’t mean the Paris Agreement is dead: WMO chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breaching-1-5-degree-c-temp-rise-threshold-doesnt-mean-the-paris-agreement-is-dead-wmo-chief/articleshow/117251923.cms,"NEW DELHI: World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) secretary-general Celeste Saulo on Tuesday said the global average temperature rise breaching the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius in 2024 doesn’t mean the global climate deal is dead.She while referring to the average global temperature rise of 1.55 degree C in 2024 over the pre-industrial (1850-1900) period, however, termed the rise a “very grave danger” and called for decisive climate action in 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases and speed up the transition to renewable energy.Saulo was addressing the 150th foundation day celebration which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, minister of earth science Jitendra Singh, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra and meteorologists from India and many countries including Japan, Singapore and Oman.Representatives of Pakistan did not attend it despite sending their prior confirmation while Bangladesh had declined its participation in advance citing restrictions on non-essential foreign travel at government expense.Saulo's remark on the occasion means the breaching of warming levels referred to in the Paris Agreement should be understood as temperature rise over an extended period, typically decades or longer.

3 Indian startups using SpaceX rocket to launch advanced satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-indian-startups-using-spacex-rocket-to-launch-advanced-satellites/articleshow/117251178.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a sign of the growing space technology prowess of the Indian private sector, three indigenous space startups — Bengaluru-based Digantara and Pixxel, and Hyderabad-based XDLINX Spacelabs — are set for satellite launches aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12.The satellites are scheduled to be launched at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California in the US, around 10.45 am Pacific Time (early Wednesday morning in India), subject to final approvals.While Digantara and Pixxel are launching their own satellites, XDLINX is sending satellites developed in India for US-based Almagest Space Corporation.Pixxel will deploy the first three satellites of its Firefly constellation. The satellites will be placed in a sun-synchronous orbit at roughly 550 km, with the remaining three slated for deployment in the second quarter of the year.“Once fully deployed, the constellation will equip industries and govts with actionable insights to tackle global challenges, drive informed decision-making, and advance meaningful climate action,” Pixxel said.With sensors six times sharper than the 30-metre standard of most existing hyper-spectral satellites, Fireflies will uncover hidden patterns and anomalies with unparalleled detail and accuracy, making it the world’s most advanced commercial hyper-spectral imaging system, the company said.The satellites will provide unprecedented insights for various applications, from environmental monitoring to resource management.Their enhanced spectral capabilities enable the detection of subtle changes in vegetation, water bodies, and mineral deposits, offering valuable data for industries ranging from agriculture to mining. Pixxel plans to add 18 more satellites to the six it has already developed, eyeing a share of the satellite imaging market projected to reach $19 billion by 2029.Digantara’s inaugural space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), marks a milestone as one of the world’s first commercial Space Situational Awareness (SSA) satellites.Engineered to track objects as small as 5 cm in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), SCOT promises to revolutionise space traffic management with its superior monitoring capabilities, unaffected by weather conditions or geographic limitations that constrain traditional ground-based systems.","Three Indian space startups are set for satellite launches aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12.

"BJP rakes up Atishi link, AAP questions timing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-rakes-up-atishi-link-aap-questions-timing/articleshow/117247425.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday cited the support of CM Atishi 's parents for the campaign for clemency for Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru to allege that Aam Aadmi Party had links with NGOs who supported a terrorist whom Supreme Court sentenced to death for plotting the attack, which almost triggered a war with Pakistan.Talking to reporters after Delhi Police claimed that the hundreds of calls over the past few months threatening terror attacks on schools were made by a 17-year-old whose one parent had signed the petition seeking clemency for Guru, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Kejriwal owed an answer to people because of its antecedents. Describing the police findings as sensitive and serious, Trivedi claimed that the probe revealed the student's parents were associated with NGOs involved in activities considered inimical to national security.He said AAP had come out in support of those who raised ""tukde tukde"" slogans in JNU in 2015 wishing India's dismemberment and vowing revenge for Guru's death, while the Kejriwal govt had sat over Delhi Police's request for sanction for prosecution of the ""tukde tukde"" gang for years before giving in to popular pressure.""All of us know that AAP has deep bonds with NGOs who opposed Afzal Guru's hanging. In Feb 2015, 'tukde tukde' slogans were raised on Afzal Guru's death anniversary, and AAP kept the file closed for months. Who are the people behind these NGOs, and are they related to AAP? Both parents of Delhi CM Atishi supported the clemency petition for Guru. There seems to be a direct connection between these events. Is AAP involved in this?"" Trivedi, accompanied by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, asked. Atishi's parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, were among several activists and professors who had signed a mercy petition for Guru in 2013.""I ask Arvind Kejriwal to come forward and clarify AAP's relationship with these individuals. If juveniles are doing this, what kind of venom are these NGOs injecting into the minds of our country's children? We want a clear answer from AAP. If they don't provide one, it only deepens the doubt,"" Trivedi said.""Kejriwal talks nonsense and makes false statements. I want to ask clearly if AAP will clarify its links to these horrifying and dangerous revelations because there appears to be a direct ideological similarity with you in this case,"" he added. Sachdeva said the investigation would eventually reveal the links between the NGO, AAP, and its leaders. ""It's not a coincidence. Those emails were sent to 400 schools under a well-thought-out conspiracy to create an atmosphere of fear in Delhi because they had to win the elections,"" he said.""Arvind Kejriwal is not just an enemy of Delhi but of the country as well.

NEW DELHI: """", ""between Congress and BJP "", ""Friends every morning and fight at night"" ... the knives are out as the three-way battle for Delhi gets bigger and bitter.The ruling AAP , which faces an aggressive BJP and a belligerent Congress in its pursuit for a third consecutive term, has accused its political rivals of being hand in glove Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday claimed that the February 5 elections would expose the 'jugalbandi' going on behind the scenes between the Congress and the BJP for years.The AAP supremo was reacting to a post by Amit Malviya, which the BJP IT department head had made in response to Kejriwal's attack on Rahul Gandhi When Kejriwal responded to Rahul Gandhi's attacks on him with a dig ""I am working to save the country, he is fighting to save the Congress"", BJP leader Amit Malviya used this response to take a swipe at the AAP chief and advised him to first save his New Delhi assembly seat and worry about the country later.Kejriwal who has represented the New Delhi seat since 2013 is pitted against BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit this time.In fact, Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit reacting sharply to Kejriwal's remarks, questioned the AAP chief's integrity. ""Which country is he saving? When you swindled Rs 2,000 crore in the liquor policy, were you saving the country? When you claimed you wouldn’t buy a bungalow and instead moved into a luxurious Rs 30-32 crore palace, were you saving the country? When you were secretly helping the BJP win in Haryana, Goa, and Uttarakhand, were you saving the country? And when you failed to clean the drains, failed to provide water, and polluted Delhi’s air, were you saving the country then?"" Dikshit questioned.The verbal duel between friends-turned-rivals sharpened on Tuesday as Rahul Gandhi continued with his relentless attacks on the AAP government taunting Kejriwal's model of governance in the national capital.A day after comparing Kejriwal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over fake promises, Rahul today launched a campaign to ""expose"" AAP government's empty and hollow promises of transforming Delhi into a world-class city.""Dekho, dilli dekho, yeh hai chamkati hui dilli. Paris jaisi dilli ... sab jagah yahi haal hai” (See the city, this is Delhi, this is shining Delhi, the Delhi which looks like Paris), Rahul was heard saying on camera as he visited Delhi’s Rithala area to showcase the glaring gaps between the AAP government’s promises and reality on the ground.Meanwhile, the BJP seems to be enjoying this war of words between the two INDIA bloc partners.Madhya Pradesh cabinet minister Kailash Vijayvargiya took a potshot at the Congress vs AAP tussle and said that they (Congress) make friends in the morning and fight at night.""Sometimes they (Congress) shake hands and sometimes they break each other's hands. It is their culture (sanskaar). Sometimes they join hands with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and sometimes Mamata ji abuses them and again they abuse Mamata ji. Similarly, sometimes they join hands with Akhilesh Yadav, then leave hands and abuse each other,"" Vijayvargiya said.""These are the kind of people, who make friends every morning and fight at night. Now whether these people abuse or praise is not important, the public knows everything,"" he added.And it's not just the BJP that is attacking the Congress. On Tuesday, Sharad Pawar, one of the key architects of the INDIA bloc, also sided with Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi battle joining the likes of Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav. The two regional leaders have already announced their support for AAP in the Delhi elections making it a lonely battle for the grand-old-party. The only relief perhaps for the Congress is that none of these parties have much presence in the national capital.This is not the first time that AAP and Congress are facing off in Delhi. In the last two assembly elections also the Congress was AAP's rival but could not make any impact and even failed to open its account. But this time around the Congress seems to be gunning for Kejriwal like never before. With the AAP battling 10 years of anti-incumbency, will the Congress manage to dent the fortunes of the ruling party?",The verbal duel between friends-turned-rivals sharpened on Tuesday as Rahul Gandhi continued with his relentless attacks on the AAP government.

"In a first, SC collegium meets judge aspirants outside Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-sc-collegium-meets-judge-aspirants-outside-delhi/articleshow/117246374.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly three decades of its existence, the Supreme Court collegium met with candidates recommended for judgeship by the collegiums of the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana high courts last weekend in Visakhapatnam to assess their personality, suitability, and competence for constitutional court judgeship.Since the creation of the collegium system by two judgments of the SC in the 1990s for selection of constitutional court judges and insulate judiciary from influence of the executive, this is the first time the SC collegium, led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna and comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, carried out a part of the judge election process outside Delhi.More than 20 of the 32 SC judges went with their families for a retreat at Visakhapatnam, a busy east-coast city in Andhra Pradesh. With the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana HCs recommending candidates each for HC judgeship, the collegium decided that instead of calling the candidates to Delhi for interaction, it would be better to assess them at Visakhapatnam which will save the candidates both time and money.The interaction with three candidates from Andhra Pradesh and five from Telangana took place in the hotel where the SC judges were lodged for retreat. The collegium had kicked in the novelty of personal interaction with candidates on Dec 22 when it assessed the suitability, capability and personality of candidates recommended for judgeship in the Allahabad, Bombay and Rajasthan HCs.Earlier, the SC collegium solely went by the detailed biodata of the lawyers and judicial officers submitted by HC collegiums as well as the intelligence reports about their antecedents and opinions of the concerned governors and chief ministers. The personal interaction with the recommended candidates helped in judging first-hand their demeanour and suitability for appointment as judges, sources said.The collegium is at present debating on two significant proposals to weed out the 'father-uncle judge' influence in the selection of judges to HCs. Given the widespread discontent among lawyers that first generation lawyers seldom get considered for HC judgeship when pitted against sitting or former constitutional court judges' lawyer children, the initial proposal was rather radical - pause selecting kith and kin of sitting and former judges' children as HC judges.Though many lawyers welcomed the proposal, some felt it would be discriminatory to bar appointment of competent lawyers as HC judges solely because they are children of sitting or former judges.

Heavy-duty military drone of Israeli-origin crashes into the sea off Porbandar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heavy-duty-military-drone-of-israeli-origin-crashes-into-the-sea-off-porbandar/articleshow/117242099.cms,"NEW DELHI: A heavy-duty drone or remotely-piloted aircraft, assembled in India by Adani Defence and Aerospace under license from Israel, crashed into the sea during pre-acceptance trials off Porbandar in Gujarat on Monday.The medium-altitude, long endurance (MALE) drone called Drishti-10 by the Adani group, based on the Hermes 900 Starliner of Israeli firm Elbit Systems, was being operated by the vendor from the Porbandar naval air enclave when it ditched into the sea.“The vendor has retrieved the drone and will analyse what went wrong. It has no financial implications for the Navy since the drone was yet to be delivered,” an official said.The Army and Navy in 2023 ordered two each of these satcom-enabled drones, which are touted to be capable of operating at an altitude of up to 30,000-feet with an endurance of 36 hours and a 450-kg payload, under emergency procurement provisions.Each of these drones, which are designed for long-range ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) missions, costs around Rs 120 crore. While the first Drishti-10 was delivered to the Navy in Jan last year, the Army got the second in June. The one that crashed on Monday was earmarked for the Navy.The armed forces, which over the years have imported a large number of Israeli Searcher, Heron Mark-I and Mark-II drones for long-range surveillance and precision-targeting, require almost 150 new MALE remotely-piloted aircraft systems.India in October last year had inked the Rs 32,350 crore contract with the US for 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’, which are high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones. Under it, 15 MQ-9B Sea Guardians are earmarked for the Navy, while the Army and IAF will get eight Sky Guardians each, all armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons.","The medium-altitude, long endurance (MALE) drone called Drishti-10 by the Adani group, based on the Hermes 900 Starliner of Israeli firm Elbit Systems.

Imagine a sea of humanity, each individual contributing to the vibrant mosaic of faith and devotion. In this awe-inspiring spectacle, the silent heroes are the advanced waste management technologies working tirelessly behind the scenes. Like unsung conductors of a grand symphony, these innovations ensure that every note of cleanliness and hygiene is perfectly in tune.From high-tech sewage treatment plants to natural purification ponds, each element plays a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity of the environment. This harmonious blend of tradition and technology not only preserves the spiritual essence of the Maha Kumbh but also sets a benchmark for future large-scale gatherings worldwide.Imagine a bustling city that springs up overnight, teeming with millions converging for a grand spiritual gathering. A 45-day religious event that attracts an estimated 40 crore visitors. The logistical challenge of managing the waste generated each day is staggering. The authorities, however, are not daunted. They have enlisted the help of Indian Space Research Organisation and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), two of India's premier scientific institutions, to tackle this Herculean task.The scale of waste generation at the Maha Kumbh is mind-boggling: nearly 16 million litres of faecal sludge and 240 million litres of greywater every day, and massive solid waste from millions of pilgrims. Managing this requires sophisticated solutions, and that's where advanced technologies come into play.One of these is the Hybrid Granular Sequencing Batch Reactor (hgSBR), developed through an Isro-BARC collaboration. Imagine a high-tech washing machine, but instead of cleaning clothes, it treats sewage. This technology will be used at three prefabricated Faecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTPs), efficiently processing human waste and ensuring that the environment remains clean and safe.Another innovative technique is Geotube Technology . Think of it as a giant tea bag which holds and treats large volumes of liquid waste. This technology helps in the containment and treatment of waste, ensuring that only clean water is released back in the environment.Bioremediation is another fascinating approach being used at the Maha Kumbh. Picture a series of large ponds, each teeming with beneficial microorganisms that break down pollutants and cleanse the water. This natural and environment-friendly method will be applied to greywater collected in approximately 75 large ponds, ensuring the water is treated effectively and safely.The Uttar Pradesh govt has shown significant commitment to waste management, with a total Maha Kumbh budget of Rs 7,000 crore. Rs 1,600 crore is dedicated to waste and water management, and Rs 316 crore is specifically allocated for open defecation free (ODF) infrastructure. This financial and infrastructural commitment underscores the importance of maintaining hygiene and sanitation during the event.The technologies being deployed aim to mitigate several critical environmental concerns. They prevent river water contamination, reduce potential health risks from waste and sewage, and minimise the ecological footprint of the massive gathering. The operational strategy for waste management includes reducing manual handling to a minimum, emphasising source-level waste segregation using advanced technological interventions, and implementing strategic disposal mechanisms.Additional preparatory measures include the installation of 1.45 lakh portable toilets, the deployment of a number of sweepers for continuous cleaning, the establishment of sufficient medical facilities, and a comprehensive waste collection and management infrastructure.These advanced technologies represent a paradigm shift in managing large-scale religious gatherings. They offer environmentally sustainable waste management, reduced health risks, minimal ecological disruption, and efficient resource utilisation. Maha Kumbh 2025 stands as a testament to India's technological prowess in managing complex logistical and environmental challenges associated with massive religious congregations. It stands as a shining example of how technology and tradition can come together to create a cleaner, healthier future for all.(The writer is Union minister for science and technology)",The Maha Kumbh Mela is a 45-day religious event that attracts an estimated 40 crore visitors.

NEW DELHI: India's meteorological advancement has not only built the country's disaster management capacity but also benefited the world with India always standing up to help nations hit by natural calamities, including those in its neighbourhood, PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.Indicating how it further expanded the country's soft power and ""enhanced its image globally as a 'Vishwa Vandhu'"", PM Modi, while addressing the 150th foundation day celebration of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) here, said this is not 150 years of journey of only the Met department, but also a ""glorious journey of India's modern science and technology"".Citing the country's 'flash flood guidance system', he noted that it helps neighbouring nations such as Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka by sharing information, and commended IMD scientists for their significant contributions to these achievements.Referring to the substantial progress made in the weather information dissemination system in the past decade, Modi pointed out that only 10% of farmers and livestock owners used weather-related advice 10 years ago, but this number has now increased to over 50%.The PM on the occasion launched 'Mission Mausam' with the goal of making the country a 'weather-ready, climate-smart' nation, and released the ' IMD Vision 2047 ' document that spells out the next 22 years journey of the Met department for making India a global leader in weather forecast system, climate modelling and export of meteorological instruments.'Mission Mausam' aims at achieving the goal by deploying cutting-edge weather surveillance technologies and systems, implementing high-resolution atmospheric observations, next-generation radars and satellites, and high-performance computers in the coming years.Encouraging scientists, research scholars and institutions like IMD to work towards new breakthroughs, Modi highlighted the need to work with future requirements in mind, including developing early warning systems for natural disasters like earthquakes.Underlining India's rich history of meteorological expertise, the PM pointed out that the country's traditional knowledge was well documented, refined and deeply studied in ancient texts like the Vedas, Samhitas, and Surya Siddhanta, and called for greater exploration and integration of this knowledge with contemporary scientific practices.""There is a need to research more in this direction and explore how to link substantiated (traditional) knowledge with modern science,"" said Modi after citing numerous examples of ancient texts carrying information on meteorology.He also referred to how significant works such as 'Krishi Parashar' and 'Brihat Samhita' studied cloud formation and types, and the mathematical work on planetary positions at the time where there were no scientific instruments available to study those phenomena.Lauding the IMD's efforts towards accuracy of its forecast, the PM spoke how his visit to Sonamarg in J&K to inaugurate a 6.5-km tunnel on Monday was planned on the basis of the Met department's advance prediction of a clear weather day in the snow-clad region.Established on Jan 15 in 1875, IMD has been at the forefront of providing critical weather and climate services, playing a vital role in disaster management, agriculture, aviation, and public safety. Its overall forecast accuracy witnessed a 40% improvement in 2023 as compared to 2014.Addressing the gathering, Union minister of earth sciences Jitendra Singh pointed to the rise in the accuracy of weather forecasts in the last 10 years.","PM Narendra Modi: India's meteorological advancement has built the country's disaster management capacity.

PM Modi inaugurates Z-Morh tunnel in J&K: All you need to know about the project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-inaugurates-z-morh-tunnel-in-jk-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-project/articleshow/117191512.cms,"What we know about tunnel so far:

The Z-Morh tunnel, built at a cost of Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region. The construction commenced in May 2015 and reached completion in the previous year. The tunnel's initial opening took place in February 2024.

This infrastructure holds strategic importance for national defence requirements in Ladakh whilst establishing reliable connectivity between the Union Territory and the rest of India.

Located at 8,650 feet elevation, this two-lane tunnel features an additional 7.5-metre-wide emergency escape passage running parallel to the main structure.

The tunnel facilitates uninterrupted travel between Gagangir and Sonamarg, particularly benefiting summer travel to Ladakh.

This 2-lane road tunnel is being built under the mountain glacier Thajiwas Glacier between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district of Kashmir ensuring all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg boosting tourism. The strategic location of the Sonamarg tunnel will help in bypassing the major avalanche zones of NH-1 in the hung area which will ensure the safety of commuters.

This project features a third lane on the approach road to optimize traffic management by enabling the seamless movement of slow-moving vehicles while allowing faster-moving traffic to bypass without obstruction, thereby mitigating congestion and preventing traffic bottlenecks previously caused by heavy or slow-moving vehicles.

Working in conjunction with the Zojila tunnel currently under construction, this infrastructure will provide continuous access for both civilian and military vehicles to the Baltal and Ladakh areas.

The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), overseeing the project, confirmed the tunnel's advanced technological features providing continuous updates and connectivity. This modern infrastructure aims to enhance travel efficiency and establish improved road connectivity standards.

Together with the Zojila Tunnel, scheduled for completion by 2028, the project will decrease the route distance from 49 km to 43 km and increase vehicle speeds from 30 km/hr to 70 km/hr, ensuring continuous NH-1 connectivity between Srinagar and Ladakh. Officials indicate this improved access will strengthen defence logistics and promote economic and socio-cultural development across Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir that will make the Sonamarg tourist resort accessible throughout the year.Along with the PM, Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and chief minister Omar Abdullah was also present there at the event.Earlier today, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell chief Amit Malaviya shared a video on X and said that the Modi government is empowering Jammu & Kashmir.","The Z-Morh tunnel, built at a cost of Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said commissioning of two made-in-India warships and a submarine on January 15 would ""strengthen our efforts towards being a global leader in defence and augment our quest towards self-reliance"".PM Modi said the commissioning of the destroyer INS Surat , frigate INS Nilgiri and submarine INS Vaghsheer in Mumbai's Naval dockyard on Wednesday would mark a ""special day for naval capacities"".""Tomorrow, 15th January, is going to be a special day as far as our naval capacities are concerned.

These are an advanced version of the Kolkata-class (Project-15A) destroyers, featuring substantial improvements in design, automation and ordnance.Nilgiri is the lead ship of Project-17A, which is a series of stealth guided-missile frigates being built for the Indian Navy. It has enhanced stealth features (reduced radar signatures) and state-of-the-art technology compared to the current Shivalik-class frigates. Designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau, New Delhi, Nilgiri is enabled to operate independently without supporting vessels, and also to function as the flagship of the naval task force.The sixth Scorpene-class submarine under the Kalvari-class Project 75, Vaghsheer is one of the most silent and versatile diesel-electric submarines in the world. It is designed to undertake a wide range of missions, including anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, area surveillance and special operations.It features, among others, a modular construction, allowing for future upgrades such as the integration of Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology. AIP, which allows submarines to operate without needing to surface to get oxygen, can be used to replace or supplement the diesel-electric propulsion system of non-nuclear submarines.","PM Modi said commissioning of the destroyer INS Surat, frigate INS Nilgiri and submarine INS Vaghsheer in Mumbai's Naval dockyard on Wednesday would mark a ""special day for naval capacities"" Surat is part of Project-15B or Visakhapatnam-class, which is aimed at building a new generation of guided- missile destroyers.

"Cops link NGO to hoaxes; BJP, AAP in war of words",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-link-ngo-to-hoaxes-bjp-aap-in-war-of-words/articleshow/117247259.cms,"How cops traced origin of bomb hoax emails

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police claimed on Tuesday they were investigating a larger conspiracy behind the barrage of bomb hoaxes sent to schools which had kept the city on tenterhooks through 2024. Forensic investigation of a laptop and phone seized from a student identified and located last week has allegedly led the cops to an NGO which was supported and closely associated with a political party, police claimed. They named neither the NGO, nor the party.Special CP Madhup Tiwari said police carried out a background check of the accused after it emerged that he had allegedly sent 400 emails to schools between Feb 2024 and Jan 2025. ""It emerged that an NGO had significant influence at the workplace of the juvenile's guardian. This NGO has a long-standing association and deep connection with a political party. This NGO is known for opposing the hanging of Afzal Guru, a terrorist involved in the 2001 Parliament attack,"" Tiwari said.""It (the NGO) also openly engages in advocacy of and supporting a particular political party on various issues. The influence of this NGO and its proximity to a political party raises critical questions about a possible larger conspiracy to create public unrest through disruptive tactics. Through scientific means, digital forensic analysis and other technical surveillance and intelligence apparatus, further deep investigation is in progress to ascertain the angle of the larger conspiracy, players involved (directly or indirectly) behind this sinister activity and other such hoax emails,"" Tiwari added.The probe is now focused on ascertaining if the accused student acted alone. ""It seems unlikely that he did due to several factors. The probe is at an initial stage. We will divulge more at an appropriate time,"" said Tiwari. During questioning, the juvenile claimed to have sent the mails to get an exam postponed or cancelled but the cops found instances where he sent out mails when there were no exams. He didn't answer when the cops pointed this out, prompting the cops to probe a bigger conspiracy.According to police, the hoax threats were delivered through heavily encrypted email services and complex digital pathways, indicating an intent to conceal identity and evade detection. Considering the technical complexities and advanced techniques used in sending these emails, besides the involvement of a juvenile, the role of other entities was also probed.The first email from the accused allegedly came in Feb 2024. In May last year, he allegedly sent mails to 250 schools at one go, police claimed. The last mail came on Jan 7-8 this year when 23 schools received hoax mails. The sender used the ID troyisns@gmail.com and wrote that powerful bombs had been planted to destroy buildings and harm everyone within the blast radius. The email also claimed that the invigilators would be distracted during exams and the bombs would be detonated at that ""precise moment"" to cause maximum impact.The cops used advanced cyber forensic techniques to trace the origin of these emails. Earlier, the mails had been sent using a VPN service. The cops had sought replies from Google, service providers and VPN firms. This time, sources said, the VPN plan of the accused student had expired, exposing the IP address of the sender.The cops subsequently located the device using IPDR (internet protocol details records) analysis. The investigators successfully identified the accused using digital footprints and email-tracking mechanisms. ""The accused used multiple anonymous and encrypted email service providers and advanced tools to conceal his identity. However, advanced technical methods helped in uncovering his digital trail. He was traced to his residence, where a search operation was conducted and two phones and a laptop were seized,"" said DCP Ankit Chauhan.""These devices were subjected to a preliminary forensic analysis, revealing conclusive and irrefutable digital evidence directly linking the accused to the threatening emails,"" he added.A preliminary examination and analysis of the evidence have revealed that the primary motive behind these hoax threatening emails was to create panic and disruption in schools, the police said. An extensive probe is still on to decipher the exact motives behind sending such a large number of hoax emails, officials said.The case was investigated by a special team led by joint CP Sanjay Jain and DCP Chauhan. The SIT comprised additional DCP Achin Garg, ACP Abhinendra Jain, inspector Hansraj Swami and SI Sandeep Saini amongst others.","Delhi Police claim they are investigating a larger conspiracy behind the barrage of bomb hoaxes sent to schools.

BMI by itself isn't an accurate tool to diagnose obesity: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bmi-by-itself-isnt-an-accurate-tool-to-diagnose-obesity-study/articleshow/117247082.cms,"NEW DELHI: For years, doctors have relied on Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations to assess obesity. However, a global commission convened by The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, a reputed medical journal, now argues that BMI provides inaccurate results.It has suggested doctors should confirm whether a person has obesity or not by at least one other body measurement, for example, waist circumference , or by measuring body fat directly.BMI is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of a person's height to her or his weight to estimate the amount of body fat she or he has.Current definition says a person with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above can be considered obese.According to the Lancet Commission's report, which was released Tuesday, people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI above 30, meaning that their health risk can go unnoticed.Similarly, it says, individuals with high muscle mass (eg. Athletes) tend to have high BMIs despite normal fat mass and diagnosing them as having obesity or a disease was inappropriate.""Relying on BMI alone to diagnose obesity is problematic as some people tend to store excess fat at the waist or in and around their organs, such as the liver, the heart or the muscles, and this is associated with a higher health risk compared to when excess fat is stored just beneath the skin in the arms, legs or in other body areas. But people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI that indicates they are living with obesity, meaning their health problems can go unnoticed. Additionally, some people have a high BMI and high body fat but maintain normal organ and body functions, with no signs or symptoms of ongoing illness."" Robert Eckel, a professor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (USA), who was part of the expert group, said.Dr Anoop Misra, a doctor from India who was in the expert committee, added: ""Abdominal obesity is very common in India. The existing criteria based on BMI measurement often fails to classify them as obesity. The new classification will help remove this hurdle.""The Lancet Commission says not all persons having obesity need medical or surgical intervention. It has, for the first time, recommended sub-dividing obesity into two groups: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity , based on the presence or absence, respectively, of objective clinical manifestations (ie, signs and symptoms) of altered organ function or impairment of an individual's ability to conduct daily activities.Persons with preclinical obesity, the Commission suggests, does not generally require treatment with drugs or surgery, and might need only monitoring of health over time and health counselling if the individual's risk of progression to clinical obesity or other diseases is deemed sufficiently low.However, it adds, those having clinical obesity may require medical or surgical intervention as obesity, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications including an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.","BMI is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of a person's height to her or his weight.

Prominent among these are former Union minister Krishna Tirath and former AAP MLA Dharampal Lakra, who recently switched to the party.Congress has now announced candidates for 63 out of the total 70 assembly seats.While Tirath has been fielded from the Patel Nagar (SC) constituency, Lakra, who won on an AAP ticket in Mundka in the 2020 polls, will contest from the same seat. Congress has also nominated former MLA Asif Mohammad Khan's daughter and Shaheen Bagh councillor Ariba Khan from the Okhla assembly constituency.In a notable change, Pramod Kumar Jayant replaces former councillor Ishwar Bhagri for the Gokulpur constituency, which is reserved for SC candidates.The list features several former MLAs, including Kanwar Karan Singh from Model Town and Bhisham Sharma from Ghonda. Singh served three consecutive terms as the Model Town MLA in 1998, 2003 and 2008, but lost the election in 2013 and 2015. His daughter Akanksha Ola contested in 2020, but was defeated.Similarly, Sharma represented Ghonda constituency as MLA from 1998 till 2008. He contested in 2015, but lost. He later joined BJP after being expelled from Congress in April 2019. He returned to the party in 2020 and contested the election, but lost.Tirath, who is also a former Delhi govt minister, had left Congress for four years, returning to the party fold in 2019. She contested from Patel Nagar in 2020 but was defeated by former AAP MLA Raaj Kumar Anand.During her political career, Tirath held the position of Union minister in the UPA-2 govt before joining BJP in 2015, just ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, where she contested unsuccessfully. Her extensive political experience includes roles as metropolitan councillor, three-term Delhi MLA, state minister, two-term MP and cabinet minister.Earlier, Congress had nominated Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba from Kalkaji to take on chief minister Atishi.

Kejriwal has Z-Plus security . The move comes after intelligence inputs suggested that operatives of a pro-Khalistan outfit would try to assassinate Kejriwal.According to the alert, a hit squad comprising two-three men, which was last spotted in Punjab and may be headed for Delhi, would make an attempt on Kejriwal's life. ""Pakistan's ISI is behind the plot which, at the face of it, seems aimed at disrupting law and order and harmony in both states. It is a hum-int (human intelligence) and we are trying to corroborate further details,"" said the source.This is not the first time that a plot has been uncovered to target Kejriwal. In 2014, the intelligence establishment had warned of a plot being hatched by Indian Mujahideen to abduct Kejriwal in order to secure the release of its jailed chief Yasin Bhatkal. Delhi Police had then stepped up his security. Kejriwal has also been in the crosshairs of the Sikhs For Justice group. Under Z-Plus security from Delhi Police, Kejriwal has around 63 people assigned to guard him. His security apparatus comprises pilot, escort, close protection team, home guard and spotter besides search-and-frisking staff. There are around 47 people in this set-up. Apart from this, there are around 15 uniformed personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF). The security rules are as per the ""yellow book"", said sources.Atishi, who took charge as CM after Kejriwal was sent to judicial custody, was accorded Z category security as per protocol. Kejriwal's security briefly changed in Tihar where, too, he had a special security arrangement. At Jail no. 2 where he was lodged, four warders were assigned to him on a rotational basis with two stationed outside his cell and another two posted near a small garden enclosure leading to his cell. Special attention was given to ensure that Kejriwal was not attacked when he stepped outside his cell to meet his lawyers or go to the common area to make phone calls or meet his family members and relatives during mulaqats.After he faced threats from Indian Mujahideen, there were some incidents of ink being thrown at him and even physical attacks, prompting a multi-layer ring of personnel around him. In April 2014, an autorickshaw driver slapped him in Sultanpuri. Two years later, in January 2016, a man threw ink on him. Just a few months later, in April 2016, another man hurled a shoe at Kejriwal. Most recently, in May 2019, Kejriwal was targeted once again during a roadshow in Moti Nagar. TOI reached out to AAP and its response was awaited.","Security review of former Delhi CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has been undertaken.

I will be leaving sometime in March, not really certain yet.""The letter provides a rare glimpse into Jobs' spiritual side, heavily influenced by Hinduism, as he signs off with ""Shanti, Steve Jobs."" He also mentions having ""cried many times.""According to the letter, Jobs planned to visit the ashram of Neem Karoli Baba in Uttarakhand. However, upon reaching Nainital, he learned that Neem Karoli Baba had passed away the previous year. Despite this, Jobs stayed at the ashram in Kainchi Dham, finding solace in the Baba's teachings.During his seven-month stay in India, Jobs immersed himself in Indian culture. Upon returning home, his parents barely recognized him due to his transformed appearance. Jobs said, ""My head had been shaved, I was wearing Indian cotton robes, and my skin had turned a deep, chocolate brown-red from the sun.""The letter, written exactly 51 years ago, was auctioned by Bonhams, a private international auction house, for $500,312.50 (INR 4.32 crore), as said on its website.Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, due to complications from pancreatic cancer. While Jobs never attended the Kumbh Mela, his wife Laurene Powell Jobs fulfilled his long-held wish by attending the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj, India. Laurene, given the Hindu name ""Kamala"" by her guru Swami Kailashanand Giri, arrived with a 40-member team and has been participating in spiritual practices, including meditation, Kriya Yoga, and Pranayama.The Mahakumbh Mela , held every 12 years, attracts millions of devotees worldwide, celebrating India's rich spiritual heritage.","The letter, written on Jobs' 19th birthday, February 23, 1974, was addressed to his childhood friend Tim Brown.

UBT MLA says party has almost turned into Cong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ubt-mla-says-party-has-almost-turned-into-cong/articleshow/117245895.cms,"Mumbai: Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA and group leader Bhaskar Jadhav said on Tuesday that the party has almost turned into the Congress party Jadhav, while speaking to office bearers, mentioned that if the duration of posts such as of shakha pramukhs is fixed, only then will they compete to work within that period. ""Instead, now our party has almost become the Congress. It hurts to say this,"" Jadhav said, adding that earlier whenever there was a Shiv Sena programme in a village, the shakha pramukhs of that village would be involved.""Today, take a look at who the shakha pramukhs are, how many of them are there, and where are they? Some office bearers sat comfortably in one place for 10-15 years. They have the impression that no one can touch my post. If I serve the will of some leader, my post is intact, where are these shakha pramukhs?"" Jadhav said.Jadhav's comments come as a setback for Sena (UBT), which now faces a challenge to keep the cadre intact ahead of local body polls and prevent an exodus after the drubbing in the state assembly polls.Last Nov, 20 newly elected Sena (UBT) MLAs elected Aaditya Thackeray as legislative party leader. Jadhav was appointed as group leader of the legislative assembly, and MLA Sunil Prabhu was appointed as the whip of the legislative assembly.""There is massive disgruntlement in the party. After the poll debacle, no steps were taken to reorganise the office bearers and party structure. The same netas are still calling the shots, and nothing changed. The party is certainly facing an exodus in Konkan region, which used to be a bastion earlier. Now we don't have a single MP and only a couple of MLAs from there. Many losing candidates who were MLAs before complained to the top brass but with little or no change in the party policy,"" said a UBT functionary.Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said on Saturday his party would contest local body elections independently, signalling a significant shift in strategy for municipal polls.","Jadhav's comments come as a setback for Sena (UBT) which now faces a challenge to keep the cadre intact ahead of local body polls.

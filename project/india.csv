'Water bomb': China building world's most powerful mega dam in the Himalayas — how it impacts India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-bomb-china-building-worlds-most-powerful-mega-dam-in-the-himalayas-how-it-impacts-india/articleshow/126050335.cms,"China is pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a move that experts and Indian officials warn could seriously endanger water security, ecology and livelihoods downstream in India.As the river enters India as the Brahmaputra, any large-scale intervention upstream is seen as a direct risk to millions who depend on its natural flow. The proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.For India, the concern is not just environmental but existential. Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu has warned that the project could be used as a “water bomb”, with China potentially controlling the timing and volume of water released into the Brahmaputra. Sudden discharges could trigger floods, while withholding water could dry out large stretches of the river during critical periods.Although much of the Brahmaputra’s water comes from monsoon rains and tributaries within India, experts say upstream manipulation can still disturb the river’s natural rhythm. Even limited changes could affect fertile floodplains, fisheries and groundwater recharge across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, regions already vulnerable to climate stress.China has dismissed these concerns, as the Chinese foreign ministry has insisted that downstream countries will not be adversely affected. However, scepticism remains strong in India, partly shaped by China’s track record on other transboundary rivers.The technical scale of the project has also heightened fears. Brian Eyler, director of the Energy, Water and Sustainability Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, has described it as the most sophisticated hydropower system ever attempted, but also one of the riskiest.Any failure or miscalculation in such a seismically sensitive and ecologically fragile region could have cascading consequences downstream.Beijing’s management of the Mekong River has drawn repeated criticism from downstream nations, which accuse Chinese dam operators of worsening droughts by regulating water flow to suit power generation needs. While China denies these allegations, they have reinforced Indian fears about a similar approach on the Brahmaputra.The upstream developments have prompted India’s largest state-run hydropower company to push ahead with its own 11,200-megawatt project on the Brahmaputra, a move driven partly by fears of losing strategic and water security ground.Experts warn that competing mega projects on the same river system could worsen risks for both countries. Without cooperation and transparency, analysts caution, a dam-building race between India and China could undermine regional stability and place the future of the Brahmaputra and the millions who rely on it in jeopardy.","Proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.

Ashwagandha gets global health focus at WHO summit in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ashwagandha-gets-global-health-focus-at-who-summit-in-delhi/articleshow/126050368.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ashwagandha, a staple of Ayurveda and a familiar household remedy, moved into the global health spotlight at the 2nd WHO Global Traditional Medicine Summit, 2025, as international experts debated how traditional herbs can be safely integrated into modern healthcare.The summit was inaugurated on Wednesday at Bharat Mandapam by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J.P. Nadda, in the presence of Union Minister Prataprao Jadhav, marking the start of the three-day global scientific congregation being held from December 17 to 19. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is expected to grace the closing ceremony on December 19.Against this backdrop, a high-level side event organised by the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre in collaboration with the Ministry of Ayush brought Ashwagandha into sharp focus. Scientists, regulators and policymakers from across the world examined its growing international use for stress management, brain health and immunity, and discussed how centuries-old traditional knowledge can be aligned with modern scientific evidence.Addressing the gathering, Jadhav said India is steadily expanding international cooperation in traditional medicine through education, research and capacity building.He noted that India offers 104 scholarships annually to foreign nationals, has signed 26 country-level memoranda of understanding, collaborates with more than 50 institutions globally, and has set up Ayush Chairs in 15 universities and Ayush Information Cells in 43 countries. He added that collaborative research — including Ashwagandha trials in the United Kingdom, Guduchi studies in Germany and Ayurveda-based diabetes research in Latvia — is generating a growing body of scientific evidence.Speakers stressed that wider global acceptance of Ashwagandha depends on rigorous clinical research, standardised formulations and strong safety monitoring. While traditional use provides a strong foundation, experts cautioned that herbal products must meet the same quality and safety benchmarks as conventional medicines as their reach expands beyond India.International regulators shared how markets in Europe and the United States are evaluating Ashwagandha, underlining the need for clear dosage guidance and reliable quality testing to prevent misuse and misinformation.Participants agreed that sustained global collaboration is essential to ensure Ashwagandha’s benefits reach people safely without diluting the credibility of Ayurveda. The discussion reflected a broader shift in global health thinking — recognising traditional medicine as a credible, evidence-based partner in public healthcare rather than an informal alternative.","Ashwagandha moved into the global health spotlight at the 2nd WHO Global Traditional Medicine Summit, 2025.

"Sessions court confirms 2 years' jail for Maharashtra minister, brother",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sessions-court-confirms-2-years-jail-for-maharashtra-minister-brother/articleshow/126021797.cms,"File photo

PUNE/NASHIK: Conviction over securing a flat under a 10% EWS quota in 1995 by showing lower income has put a question mark over Manikrao Kokate's continuation as an MLA and as a Maharashtra cabinet minister.A Nashik sessions court upheld Tuesday a Feb 20 trial court judgment convicting and sentencing the sports minister and NCP functionary, along with his brother Vijay Kokate, to two years of rigorous imprisonment in the housing quota cheating case. The siblings had secured two flats. The court, however, set aside the trial court's direction to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and deputy collector to cancel the allotment of flats to the Kokate brothers and restore possession as earlier.Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik. The ruling triggers the risk of ""immediate disqualification"" under the Representation of the People Act for sentences of two years or more, unless a higher court stays the conviction.Public prosecutor Sudhir Kotwal said the matter must now go to the high court. ""Under the law, Kokate's disqualification is certain unless he gets a suspension of his sentence and a stay on his conviction from the high court.Even with urgent circulation, this may take eight to 10 days. There is no bar on disqualification in the intervening period,"" Kotwal said.Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar said he had not yet received the order. Supreme Court ruling from 2013 states disqualification is immediate, despite a three-month window to appeal. Relief comes only if conviction itself is stayed.Kokate's lawyer Avinash Bhide disagreed. ""We have a month's time to secure a stay and suspension from the high court. Even after that, the matter goes before the speaker,"" Bhide said.After the trial court ruling, Kokate had secured bail and on March 5, a sessions court stay on conviction and sentence during pendency of appeal. That protection has lapsed. ""Once a sessions court confirms conviction in appeal, it has no power to grant bail. The matter goes to the high court,"" Kotwal said.The prosecution said the brothers applied for flats under the EWS quota, declaring annual income of Rs 25,000 each, below the Rs 30,000 eligibility ceiling. ""Allotment relied on affidavits. When falsity emerged, onus lay on the deponents to prove otherwise,"" Kotwal said. Prosecutors said Kokate failed to disclose improved finances even by 1995, citing documents showing supplies of 70 tonnes, 80 tonnes and 120 tonnes of sugarcane in 1993, 1994 and 1995 to the Kopargaon cooperative sugar mill, yielding substantial earnings. ""This line weighed with the sessions court while affirming conviction and sentence,"" Kotwal said.Opposition parties accused BJP-headed govt of double standards, citing the swift disqualification of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after his 2023 defamation conviction and contrasting it with the continued tenure of Kokate. ""Govt should immediately dismiss Kokate,"" Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal said. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare said the party would decide its next course of action after discussing the ruling with party chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.","Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik.

SC takes exception to seeking info on suspension through RTI applications

New Delhi: In a surprise public acknowledgement of corruption in judiciary, a Supreme Court bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Wednesday said there is a growing trend of judges passing a series of orders for extraneous considerations on the eve of their retirements.While hearing a petition filed by a Madhya Pradesh principal district judge challenging his suspension 10 days prior to retirement, allegedly because of two judicial orders passed by him, the bench of CJI Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""Petitioner just before retirement started hitting sixes. It is an unfortunate trend. I do not want to elaborate on it.""Senior advocate Vipin Sanghi, appearing for the judicial officer, said he had an impressive career with very good rating in annual confidential reports. He was to superannuate on Nov 30 but was suspended on Nov 19, ostensibly because of two judicial orders. ""How can an officer be suspended for judicial orders which can be appealed against and rectified by higher judiciary?"" asked Sanghi.The bench said, ""Disciplinary proceedings cannot be initiated against a judicial officer for passing orders which are erroneous. He cannot be suspended for this. But if the orders are palpably dishonest?""The judicial officer was to retire on Nov 30. SC on Nov 20 directed the MP govt to postpone the retirement by one year as it had increased the retirement age of state employees to 62 years.The judicial officer would now retire on Nov 30, 2026. ""The judicial officer did not know, when he passed those two orders, that his retirement age had been increased by one year. There is a growing trend of judges passing so many orders just before retirement,"" the CJI said.The bench asked Sanghi as to why the judicial officer did not approach HC to challenge the suspension. Sanghi said that since it was a full court decision, the judicial officer thought it would be better to move SC for a fair hearing.The bench said, ""There are so many instances when full court decisions have been set aside by HCs on the judicial side."" The bench also took exception to the judicial officer seeking grounds for his suspension through RTI applications. ""He could have submitted a representation in this regard. It is not expected of a senior judicial officer to resort to the RTI route to get information. We see no ground to entertain the petition. The petitioner can make a representation to the HC for recall of the suspension order. The HC would decide his representation in four weeks,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court bench led by CJI Surya Kant said there is a growing trend of judges passing a series of orders for extraneous considerations on the eve of their retirements.

"7 years on, OBC list still to get Parliament's stamp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-on-obc-list-still-to-get-parliaments-stamp/articleshow/126047962.cms,".

New Delhi: The Centre has not notified the central list of OBCs for the last seven years since it granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes, which mandated that the list of backwards will in the future be approved by Parliament as against the present practice of publishing it through an executive order.The indecision on the crucial list, well-placed govt sources said, is a result of the govt's apparent reluctance to touch the Rohini commission report on sub-categorisation of backward classes - halting the transition to the new path laid down by the 102nd constitutional amendment of 2018. As a consequence, the central list of OBCs has remained frozen since 2018, without any fresh inclusion or exclusion of communities.Sources said the central list has to be notified by Parliament in view of the 102nd constitutional amendment which put NCBC at par with the national commissions for SCs and STs, while laying down that the OBC list too would follow the notification process of parliamentary approval like the lists of SCs and STs. ""...A process that was initiated in 2019 was put in deep freeze,"" a source said.The seeming hurdle created by the Rohini commission is puzzling.Sources said the govt cannot simply replicate the existing OBC list through Parliament because it was found to have many discrepancies, like spellings, and had asked the Rohini panel to compile corrections. But the panel's main mandate was sub-division of the central list of OBCs, which emerged as the key political agenda of BJP a few years ago. But since then, the governing party gave up its push to divide the backward list because of apparently altered political sensitivity, and has kept the report confidential since July 31, 2023, when the commission finally submitted its report after 14 extensions over six years.""Moving to correct the OBC list would require opening the Rohini report,"" an official said. Amid the limbo, the list has remained frozen for seven years as the old system of inclusion/exclusion, NCBC Act of 1993, was repealed along with the promulgation of the 102nd constitutional amendment. The 1993 Act had the exclusive mandate of inclusion/exclusion. Sources said there are around 450 proposals for inclusion/exclusion at different stages of processing with the social justice ministry.",The Centre has not notified the central list of OBCs for the last seven years. The indecision is a result of the govt's apparent reluctance to touch the Rohini commission report on sub-categorisation of backward classes.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog.

Student loan borrowers in the United States scored a major legal victory this week after a federal judge unequivocally refused to grant the US Department of Education additional time to process long-pending student loan forgiveness claims under the landmark Sweet v. Cardona settlement, providing renewed hope for thousands of borrowers who have been waiting months, and in some cases years, for much-needed relief.As reported by, the ruling affects more than 200,000 borrowers who applied for loan discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment programme and have been waiting for years for a decision. The court’s refusal to allow an 18-month delay reinforces a hard January 2026 deadline for relief and sends a strong message on government accountability in student loan administration.Thecase originated as a class action lawsuit filed by student loan borrowers against the first Trump administration. Borrowers alleged that the US Department of Education, under then Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, had unlawfully stalled or arbitrarily denied Borrower Defense to Repayment applications—sometimes leaving claims unresolved for years.Borrower Defense to Repayment allows federal student loan borrowers to seek loan cancellation if their educational institution engaged in misconduct, including misleading claims about job prospects, earnings potential, admissions standards, credit transferability, or the true cost of programmes.After prolonged litigation, the case was resolved in 2022 under the Biden–Harris administration through a binding settlement agreement designed to apply regardless of future political changes.Under the Sweet settlement, borrowers fall into different groups depending on when they submitted their Borrower Defense applications. Those who applied by June 2022 were eligible for automatic or expedited relief. Another group—known as “Post-Class Applicants”—submitted claims between June and November 2022.As per the settlement terms, Post-Class Applicants are entitled to full loan forgiveness if the Education Department fails to process their applications by January 28, 2026. It was this deadline that the department attempted to push back.Last month, the department argued in court that limited staffing and administrative resources made it impossible to review the remaining 200,000 applications on time, and requested an 18-month extension.The court overseeing the settlement firmly rejected the request. In a bench ruling on Thursday, US District Judge William Alsup declined to modify the settlement timeline, siding with borrowers and their legal representatives.“The student loan has been hanging over their head for how many years, how many decades, wrecking their credit,” Judge Alsup said during the hearing, according to. “It’s just not right.”Legal advocates for borrowers welcomed the decision. Eileen Connor, President and Executive Director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending (PPSL), which represents borrowers in the case, said the ruling reaffirmed borrowers’ right to timely justice after years of uncertainty.Following the court’s decision, the Department of Education must adhere to strict timelines. Borrower Defense claims from Post-Class Applicants who attended institutions on a court-approved list must be processed by January 28, 2026. If the department fails to meet this deadline, affected borrowers will automatically qualify for full settlement relief, including cancellation of eligible federal student loans and refunds of past payments.The department has until April 15, 2026, to complete reviews of all remaining Post-Class applications.The ruling comes at a time when federal student loan forgiveness options in the US are becoming more limited. As noted by, recent legislative and regulatory changes backed by congressional Republicans have weakened borrower-friendly rules governing the Borrower Defense programme.In addition, the Education Department has entered into a separate settlement that will eliminate the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, a Biden-era initiative designed to reduce monthly payments and accelerate loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers.Against this backdrop, the Sweet settlement remains one of the most consequential avenues for relief—making the court’s refusal to delay its implementation especially significant for hundreds of thousands of borrowers still awaiting resolution.","Federal court rejects US student loan forgiveness delay, clearing the way for relief to over 200,000 borrowers under the Sweet settlement.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday questioned the decision to host the fourth India–South Africa T20I in Lucknow amid dense fog and severe air pollution, after the match was eventually called off due to poor visibility.Tharoor suggested the game should have been scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram, citing significantly better air quality conditions there.In a post on X, the Congress leader said cricket fans were “waiting in vain” as hazardous conditions stalled play.“Cricket fans have been waiting in vain for the #INDVSSAODI to start in Lucknow. But thanks to dense smog, pervasive in most north Indian cities, and an AQI of 411, visibility is too poor to permit a game of cricket.

However, the toss was repeatedly delayed as thick fog enveloped the venue, forcing umpires to conduct multiple ground inspections through the evening.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the Centre, linking the cancellation of the Lucknow match to the city’s deteriorating air quality.He alleged that the government’s policies were worsening the situation and blamed them for making conditions unsafe for players and spectators.In a post on X he wrote: ""Delhi's pollution has now reached Lucknow as well. That's why the international cricket match scheduled to be held in Lucknow is not taking place. Actually, the reason for this is not fog, but smog. The parks that we had built for Lucknow's pure air, the BJP government wants to ruin them too by organizing investment events there. BJP members are neither kin to humans nor to the environment.

""Fans expressed their disappointment following the announcement of match cancellation.With visibility failing to improve even after several assessments, match officials eventually called off the game.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday gave its nod to the the nuclear energy bill called the ""Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI), 2025"". The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.The amended bill was tabled in the lower house, with introduction by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House on Monday, signifying a policy shift in the atomic sector operations. The bill allows entry of private players into the industry, something that was reserved for government enterprises till now. Singh said that it provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. ""The proposed legislation further aims to facilitate significant growth in nuclear energy and its applications across multiple sectors. This aligns with country's target to establish 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The law introduces fresh regulatory provisions encompassing updated safety protocols, a specialised nuclear tribunal for resolving disputes, and modifications to the nuclear liability framework to limit risks and encourage investments.The proposed legislation permits private enterprises and their collaborative ventures to seek authorisation for establishing and running nuclear facilities, as well as transporting nuclear fuel. However, crucial operations including uranium enrichment, spent fuel handling and heavy water manufacturing shall continue to be exclusively managed by the Central government. The Centre will maintain oversight of radioactive materials and radiation-producing apparatus to ensure proper safety standards.","The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.

Opposition remains unsparing

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad on Wednesday defended his controversial remark on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s hijab, saying his comment was ""misunderstood"" due to translation issues and carried no ill intent, even as opposition parties intensified their demand for an unconditional apology.As outrage mounted across political lines, the Nishad Party chief sought to play down the remark, describing it as a casual, light-hearted comment made in Hindi that lost its meaning when translated.The comment, widely criticised as misogynistic and crude, was made during an interview with a private television channel and later circulated on social media.""My remark was tweaked and twisted, misinterpreted, its spirit lost in cacophony and translation,"" the Uttar Pradesh fisheries minister told news agency PTI, responding to criticism from the Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).""If someone has taken offence, I am willing to take back the words from my side,"" he said.Nishad argued that linguistic and cultural differences played a role in the backlash, pointing to his roots in the Bhojpuri-speaking belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh.""I belong to Gorakhpur and the Bhojpuri-speaking belt and expressions and conversational styles differ from region to region,"" he said, adding, ""In Bhojpuri, this is a common way of urging people not to make too much of any issue and to counsel restraint.I chose to use the same style in Hindi and didn't know it will become such an issue.""Drawing comparisons with other regions, he said, ""Just as language and expressions vary in Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu, dialects in north India and eastern Uttar Pradesh also differ. That does not mean there was any intention to insult.""The controversy stems from a video showing Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s veil during a government programme in Patna on Monday. Nishad defended the Bihar chief minister’s action, claiming Kumar had ""merely removed"" the veil to confirm whether the actual beneficiary of a government scheme was present.He further said the lapse lay with officials responsible for organising the event. ""The responsibility lay with officials who should have ensured proper arrangements before the programme,"" he said.Nishad insisted his comments were not directed against any woman, community or religion. ""There was neither malice nor any intention of disrespect,"" he said, while alleging that the issue was being deliberately amplified for political gains.The controversy snowballed after Nishad made the remark during the televised interview: ""(He is also a man; one should not go after someone so much. What happened if the veil was removed? What would have happened if he had touched somewhere else?""Congress’ Uttar Pradesh chief Ajay Rai described Nishad’s statement as ""outrageously anti-women"" and said it reflected the mindset of the BJP and its allies. ""We seek unconditional apology failing which we will seek minister's dismissal,"" Rai told PTI.Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abbas Haider termed the remarks ""condemnable and undignified"", adding, ""I would also like to ask if this is the idea of the BJP led government in UP which the minister has reflected in his statements."" He too demanded ""an immediate and unconditional apology.""The AAP’s Uttar Pradesh unit accused the minister of making ""shameful"" and ""anti-women"" comments, saying the statement exposed a ""crude and misogynistic mindset"".Social media platforms were flooded with posts criticising Nishad for what many described as an unacceptable and sexist viewpoint.The video clip has since been widely shared, further fuelling the political storm around the minister’s comments.","Uttar Pradesh fisheries minister Sanjay Nishad defends his controversial remark on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman's hijab.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday continued hearing matters related to Delhi’s air pollution crisis, with air quality remaining in the “severe” category in several areas of the national capital region.The court has orally observed that the measures taken by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the rising levels of air pollution in the Delhi–NCR region. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant remarked that any meaningful reduction in pollution would require broader and long-term planning rather than ad-hoc responses.During the hearing, the court said, “Let us think of pragmatic and practical solution of the menace,” stressing the need for workable measures to address the pollution crisis.During the proceedings, the bench was also informed about another issue related to the MCD toll at Gurgaon, which allegedly causes traffic congestion for hours, leading to long queues of vehicles and adding to air pollution. The court directed the DMC to cooperate on the issue and consider suspension of nine toll plazas for a temporary period. It said a decision should be taken within one week and placed on record.CJI Surya Kant remarked, “we do not want income you generate, but you definately generate a lot of litigation from these tolls ...wewant to come out on a concrete plan for absolute no toll plaza till next year 31st January.""The court further asked the Delhi government to verify construction workers rendered idle by pollution curbs and ensure direct transfer of funds to their bank accounts, cautioning that the money should not “disappear, travel to another account”. It also asked the government to consider providing alternative work to affected workers.Responding to the court, the Delhi government said that around 7,000 construction workers have so far been verified out of nearly 2.5 lakh workers affected, and that money would be transferred into their bank accounts.With respect to various petitions highlighting the inadequacy of recent measures aimed at protecting children, such as the Delhi government’s directives to shut schools or allow them to function in a hybrid mode, the Court noted that these were merely temporary policy decisions taken to mitigate health risks.The bench refused to interfere with the Delhi government’s decision regarding school closures or hybrid operations. “The short-term measures are only to provide temporary protection to children and elderly persons. These are purely interim policy decisions. At best, they can be viewed as an extension of vacations, as schools are anyway scheduled to remain closed for 10 to 15 days during the winter,” the Court observed.The observations came as the top court reviewed the continuing impact of air pollution despite repeated directions issued over the years. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, has been monitoring the situation as air quality continues to pose serious health risks.The bench has also flagged lifestyle choices of the affluent as a major reason behind poor implementation of pollution-control measures. The Chief Justice observed that the well-off continue to use large diesel vehicles, generators and other polluting equipment in violation of restrictions, even as vehicular emissions choke the region. The court noted that it is the poor and working classes who are the most exposed to hazardous air and suffer the worst health consequences.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) told the court last week that the transport sector contributes about 41 per cent of Delhi-NCR’s ambient air pollution load. Dust and construction activities account for 21 per cent, industry 19 per cent, power plants 5 per cent, residential activities 3 per cent and other sources 11 per cent. CAQM said stubble burning is a periodic factor limited to a short window each year, while other sources remain constant.",The court has orally observed that the measures taken by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the rising levels of air pollution in the Delhi–NCR region.

""Further clarifying it added, ""These documents, relating to the first Prime Minister of India, form part of the nation’s documentary heritage and not a private property.

Raising the issue, BJP MP Sambit Patra asked whether the PMML’s 2025 annual audit had found any Nehru-related papers missing. In response, Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said the annual inspection had not found any missing papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru.","The government issued a statement a day after the Congress demanded an apology citing a government reply in Parliament.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: A Goa court on Wednesday sent Saurav Luthra and Gaurav Luthra to 5-day police custody in connection with the devastating fire at an Arpora club venue. The Luthra brothers are the owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.The brothers were produced before the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court after being brought back to Goa from Thailand. The court remanded them to police custody to allow investigators to question them about the circumstances leading to the blaze and alleged safety lapses at the club.Before being produced in court, the duo underwent multiple medical examinations. After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, around 10.45 am under police escort, they were first taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and later to the District Hospital in Mapusa for health check-ups.On court directions, they were again sent for a fresh medical examination before being presented before JMFC Puja Sardesai, who ordered five days of police custody.The fire broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling, triggering a massive blaze. 25 people, including tourists and staff, lost their lives, while several others were injured.Advocate Vishnu Joshi, appearing in the Goa nightclub fire case, said the court ordered multiple medical examinations of the Luthra brothers after they complained of back pain before deciding on police custody.“Today, the brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” Joshi said.According to the police, the brothers fled India within hours of the incident. They left for Thailand on December 7, even as rescue operations were under way and a criminal case was registered against them at the Anjuna police station.Goa Police subsequently launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issuing a lookout circular and seeking an Interpol Blue Notice.After their passports were suspended by the ministry of external affairs, Thai authorities detained the brothers in Phuket for illegal stay.They were later deported to India on emergency travel documents issued by the Indian embassy. The duo landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday, where they were arrested by Goa Police and produced before a Delhi court, which granted a 48-hour transit remand.Police have booked them under various provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence.Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","The Luthra brothers are the owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.

'Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday refused to apologise for his remarks on Operation Sindoor , saying the Constitution gives him the right to ask questions.“Why will I apologise? It is out of the question. The Constitution gives me the right to ask questions,” Chavan said when asked whether he would apologise for his remarks.This comes a day after Chavan stirred controversy by claiming that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor, while questioning the conduct of the military operation.Speaking to reporters in Pune, Chavan alleged that India suffered setbacks on the first day of the operation.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor), we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan, which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” Chavan said.The Congress leader further alleged that Operation Sindoor involved only aerial and missile warfare and saw no ground movement by the armed forces.""Recently, we saw during Operation Sindoor, there was not even a one-kilometre movement of the military... Whatever happened over two or three days was only an aerial war and missile warfare. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?"" Chavan said.Reacting strongly, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress of repeatedly disrespecting the Indian Armed Forces and undermining national security operations.Poonawalla said the statements made by the former Maharashtra chief minister were “shocking” and targeted the Air Force and the armed forces.""Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress party... This is not just Prithviraj Chavan's statement; Rahul Gandhi has also made similar statements,"" Poonawalla said.All these statements reflect Rahul Gandhi's mindset, which is why Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party does not take any action against such leaders... These statements reveal their anti-army mentality,"" he added.Union minister Giriraj Singh also launched a broadside against Chavan and said that no one has the right to ""insult the valour of the Armed Forces.""""No one has the right to insult the valour of the Armed Forces. Those who do so can never think of the nation’s interest....It has become Congress’s habit to insult the Armed Forces,” Giriraj Singh said.Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was carried out in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed.","Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan refused to apologise for his remarks on Operation Sindoor.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

NEW DELHI: An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026 and left them unable to return to the US.The user shared their experience in a post on the workplace forum Blind. He said the rescheduling appears linked to a new social media vetting policy. Officials are now reviewing applicants’ posts on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to check for content seen as negative toward the US.“So I am one of those unlucky souls who got hit by the mass rescheduling this week. I had my h1b interview scheduled for December and got an email saying its moved to March 2026. MARCH. That’s literally 3 months away,” the uservwrote.They said the lack of information from employers has made the situation worse. “The worst part is nobody knows what's happening. The immigration team at my company is clueless, HR is giving generic responses like ‘we understand your frustration’ which helps exactly zero percent,” they added.The visa holder said they are currently stuck in India after their I-94 expired and are on unpaid leave.They’ve been relying on personal savings while waiting for updates and said a request to work from his company’s India office had not been answered.The user also noted that starting January 1, visa applicants will be allowed only one free rescheduling. If they miss the March appointment or needs to change it again, a visa fee of about Rs 16,000 will have to be paid.“Thousands of us got hit at the same time. december was supposed to be peak season for h1b stamping and they just wiped out the entire month. people who took expensive flights, booked hotels, all of that just gone,” they wrote.They ended the post by asking if others were facing the same situation and whether they were trying to get emergency appointments or arranging to work from India.The disruptions follow a new US State Department rule announced on December 3 that requires social-media screening for all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents starting December 15. The rule is slowing down interviews, especially at busy consulates in Hyderabad and Chennai, and has led to mass cancellations of appointments originally scheduled for mid-to-late December 2025. Many of these appointments have been pushed into next year, with some as far out as June 2026.The US Embassy in India has warned that arriving on an old appointment date could lead to denial of entry. Immigration lawyers are now advising H-1B holders in the US to avoid non-essential travel.Under the new directive, all H-1B and H-4 applicants must make their social media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity. Experts say this represents one of the largest expansions of digital-footprint scrutiny in the visa process to date.",An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

New Delhi: Announcing that protests against the move to end MGNREGA will start this week, civil society groups said Modi govt cannot use mere parliamentary majority to end a rural livelihood programme that resulted from extensive consultations across the board and forging of a national consensus that included BJP.Founding members of MGNREGA, intellectuals and advocacy groups associated with the scheme came together to slam the “VB-G RAM G” bill, arguing that provisions in the proposed legislation will mark the end of job guarantee and hurt the socially vulnerable groups that depend on it for sustenance.NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, comprising economists Jean Dreze, who was part of the Sonia Gandhi-headed NAC that played a key role in drafting the job scheme, Prabhat Patnaik and Jayati Ghosh, Annie Raja, Yogendra Yadav, B Venkat of All India Agricultural Workers Union, Mukesh Nirvasit, several NGOs and activists, addressed a press conference to express their concerns, while warning they will this week start nationwide protests against the abolition of MGNREGA. They said the shifting of financial burden to states has made the new programme uncertain as the states are cash-strapped.Patnaik said mere parliamentary majority cannot undo the national consensus that resulted in the enactment of MGNREGA, and the Modi govt needs to bring an “alternative consensus” to repeal MGNREGA. The new Bill takes away the “right-based approach” and makes the scheme a “gift” from the govt, Ghosh said.“We have seen the pattern ...Right to food is a right, but now we have ration bags coming with the PM's photo on it,” she said.Venkat said govt is trying to create a conflict between farmers and agricultural workers. “This provision to pause the scheme during peak agricultural seasons has been brought in just to please those who control the land.”Dreze said, “The Union govt would now have full power to decide when and where to implement the scheme, while the obligation is on the states. It is like saying I give a work guarantee, but don’t guarantee that the guarantee will be in place.”","Founding members of MGNREGA, intellectuals and advocacy groups associated with the scheme came together to slam the “VB-G RAM G’ bill.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Highway commuters won’t have to stop to pay user fee at national highway toll plazas by 2026-end as the govt rolls out the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. He added that the FASTag annual pass launched in Aug, which allows private vehicles to cross 200 plazas, has also come as a big relief for people.Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass. “People will be rid of stopping or slowing down at toll plazas as we roll out the MLFF toll system. Cameras above the road will read the number plate and user fee will be automatically debited from the vehicle FASTag account. All this will happen even when someone is driving at a speed of 80 kmph. I made this announcement in Rajya Sabha today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he said in RS that the new system will help save fuel worth Rs 1,500 crore and increase toll revenue by Rs 6,000 crore. The system will make toll collection transparent and corruption-free, he said.Gadkari also said that a system is being put in place where vehicle owners will have to clear all dues, including pending toll fee and e-challans when they sell their vehicles or renew registration.On the next major focus of highway development in the country, Gadkari said that now there is more thrust on building greenfield highways, which is key to reduce logistics cost. “In India, earlier the logistics cost was 16%. But the latest study by IIM-Bangalore, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Madras indicates that our logistics cost on road has reduced by 6%. The report was out three-four months back. So, I am confident that by now this logistics cost is in single digit at 9%,” he said.He said govt’s focus on infrastructure is driving India’s economic growth. “For the growth of any country, infrastructure is important. Roads, water, power, transport and communication, without developing this infrastructure, we can’t get capital investment in industry and trade & business. And, without investment, we cannot create jobs... Without jobs, we cannot eradicate poverty,” he added.","Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass.

New Delhi: IndiGo was quizzed on Wednesday by a parliamentary committee over the misery inflicted on passengers by its mass-cancellation of flights, but it blamed a variety of factors, including system glitch and adverse weather conditions, while DGCA and the aviation ministry parried off criticism of their role in the fiasco.Some committee members termed replies of different stakeholders as ""unconvincing"" and aimed at washing their hands of the crisis, encapsulated by the response of a govt official that he first came to know of the unfolding ordeal through media reports.The panel, headed by JDU's Sanjay Jha, decided to wait for the report of an inquiry ordered by DGCA before coming to a conclusion and make its recommendation. It will hold another meeting and is expected to call these stakeholders again. The DGCA-ordered committee was constituted on Dec 5 and was asked to submit its report in 15 days.Captain Sam Thomas, president of Bengaluru-based Airline Pilots Association of India, created flutter at the meeting by alleging corruption in DGCA and was asked by members to refrain from making sweeping allegations without producing evidence. He alleged that one can commit any wrong, but stay safe if he touched right feet.A committee member said IndiGo, which has offered apology for the ordeal, was far from apologetic in its response before the panel.It told the panel that several factors combined to derail its operation, including a glitch in system, which needed rebooting, and adverse weather that had their pilots stuck in different zones.IndiGo was represented by its COO Isidre Porqueras, while officials of Air India, Akasa Air, Spice Jet and Air India Express appeared before the panel as well. Civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha and top functionaries of other stakeholders were part of the deliberations.Replying to a query, IndiGo said all luggage, except 52 which remained unclaimed, have already been delivered.The panel's meeting came against the backdrop of the suspicion, subject of investigation, that IndiGo remained resistant to the implementation of guidelines (Flight Duty Time Limitation) that allowed more rest for pilots in line with global norms aimed at ensuring flyers' safety.It has been accused of engineering the disruption, leveraging its market dominance, to force the ministry to roll back the regulation as implementing it would have required the airline to hire more pilots. Faced with chaos caused triggered by disruption of IndiGo's operations, DGCA had to relax the implementation of the guidelines.IndiGo management is reported to have denied allegation in meetings with ministry.","IndiGo was quizzed on Wednesday by a parliamentary committee over the misery inflicted on passengers by its mass-cancellation of flights.

The previous survey, carried out in 2015-16, had covered only 12 states.Data from the earlier NMHS underlined the scale of the challenge. NMHS 2015-16 found that 10.6% of adults in India suffered from mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence estimated at 13.7%. National studies have since indicated that nearly 15% of India's adult population experiences mental health conditions requiring clinical intervention. The burden was higher in urban areas at 13.5%, compared to 6.9% in rural regions.According to the health ministry, NMHS-2 will generate state-wise and national estimates of priority mental health conditions, assess disability and the social and economic burden on individuals and families, and track pathways to care and service utilisation.The survey will also include a comprehensive mapping of mental health services and resources across states and UTs.The scope of NMHS-2 has been widened to study vulnerable groups such as children, women, the elderly, migrants and tribal populations, and to examine the mental health impact of climate change, disasters and displacement.Health officials said the findings are expected to strengthen the National Mental Health Programme, guide allocation of resources and inform future policy decisions, particularly in underserved and high-risk regions.","After a nine-year gap, the central govt has launched a fresh National Mental Health Survey.

A day earlier, a sessions court in Nashik upheld the trial court's Feb 20 judgment, convicting and sentencing the Kokate brothers to two years of rigorous imprisonment.Sources said CM Devendra Fadnavis wrote to governor Acharya Devvrat, recommending Kokate be divested of his portfolios (sports and youth welfare and minority development and aukaf) and that the portfolios be handed over to NCP chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Expect you to ensure safety of our posts, missions, India tells B’desh interim govt

New Delhi/Dhaka: India summoned Bangladesh high commissioner Riaz Hamidullah on Wednesday to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh. In a statement, MEA said its attention was drawn, in particular, to activities of some extremist elements who have announced plans to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka, report Sachin Parashar & Ahsan Tasnim.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters, under the banner of ""July Oikya (July Unity)"", began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including prevention of ""anti-Bangladesh conspiracies"" and the return of former PM Sheikh Hasina.Former PM Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh last year following the “July Uprising” against her govt.Hamidullah was also told that India expects the interim govt to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.Officials in Dhaka said the protest march was stopped and security around the high commission strengthened.Earlier in the day, the Indian Visa Application Centre in Dhaka suspended its operations from the afternoon due to the prevailing security situation.Indian govt also completely rejected as false the narrative sought to be created by extremist elements regarding certain recent events in Bangladesh. “It is unfortunate that the interim govt has neither conducted a thorough investigation nor shared meaningful evidence with India regarding the incidents,” said the ministry.India reiterated it has close and friendly relations with the people of Bangladesh rooted in the liberation struggle, and strengthened through various developmental and people-to-people initiatives.“We are in favour of peace and stability in Bangladesh and have consistently called for free, fair, inclusive and credible polls, conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,” it said.Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, however, said summoning the high commissioner was a “normal diplomatic practice”. The Indian high commissioner had been summoned a few days earlier, he told reporters. “It is better to accept the reality that from the beginning of the interim govt till today, there has been tension with India”, but the govt is trying to build a good working relationship with India, he said.He also said Bangladesh does not want advice from India on how its elections should be conducted. The govt is committed to holding free and fair election, Hossain said, adding, “We know we will hold a fair election, and we will do so.” Referring to Hasina’s tenure, he said India did not issue similar calls for fair elections over past 15 years.","India summons Bangladesh high commissioner Riaz Hamidullah on Wednesday to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The Supreme Court modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles.

New Delhi: Delhi govt on Wednesday mandated offices in the capital - Delhi govt and private - to function with a maximum of 50% of their employees in the workplace and the rest working from home starting Thursday, as a measure to reduce pollution in the city.Delhi labour minister Kapil Mishra said ""establishments will have to strictly enforce the work-from-home norms and also motivate employees for car-pooling"". Later in the day, the labour department issued an advisory reiterating the restrictions, adding that ""non-compliance is punishable under sections 15 and 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and other applicable laws"".The WFH provisions will not apply to essential services, including hospitals and health services, fire services, prison administration, public transport, electricity services, pollution control departments, forest department and Delhi Jal Board.The govt also announced that it will pay 10,000 to each of the registered construction workers in Delhi because of the 16-day halt in construction work due to Grap provisions aimed at curbing air pollution.In response to worsening air quality, Delhi govt has imposed Grap 4, the highest and strictest stage of Delhi-NCR's pollution control plan. Under Grap 4, construction and demolition activities have been banned, diesel trucks not carrying essential goods have been barred from entering Delhi and govt has announced it will not give fuel to non-PUC compliant vehicles.Mishra said in addition to making 50% WFH mandatory, offices are also being encouraged to adopt flexible working hours.During the period of Grap restrictions last month, construction activities in Delhi were suspended, which adversely affected the livelihoods of daily-wage construction workers. ""Taking this concern into account, Delhi govt has decided to compensate workers for the loss of income caused by the suspension of construction work. Accordingly, financial assistance of 10,000 will be provided to registered and verified construction workers,"" Kapil Mishra said.

Yogi Adityanath Targets Nehru Over Kashmir, Links Historic Blunder To India’s Long Terror Crisis

New Delhi: Asserting that “51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers” were formally taken back by the “family” in 2008 from Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library), culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress asking its senior leader Sonia Gandhi “why have these papers not been returned despite multiple reminders from PMML including the recent reminders in January and July this year”.Pointing out that Gandhi herself has acknowledged in writing that these papers are with her and promised to ""cooperate"" on the matter, Shekhawat sought that Gandhi honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML.Shekhawat’s sharp rebuke came a day after Congress spokesman and senior leader Jairam Ramesh asked “will there be an apology forthcoming” citing the govt’s reply to a question in Lok Sabha that no papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru were found missing in the annual inspection of PMML.“In reality, 51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers were formally taken back by the family in 2008 from PMML (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library). Their location is known. Hence, they are “not missing”,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.“These are not private family papers. They relate to the first Prime Minister of India and form part of our national historical record. Such papers belong in public archives, not behind closed doors,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.The ministry of culture cited a April 29, 2008 letter wherein it was requested that Gandhi wished to take back all of the private family letters and notes of former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. Accordingly, the papers were sent to Gandhi.“I respectfully ask Sonia Gandhi ji to explain to the country: What is being withheld? What is being hidden?,” Shekhawat asked and said that the “excuses” being given by Sonia for not returning these papers are “not tenable”.“History cannot be curated selectively,” Shekhawat said and added that “transparency is the foundation of democracy and archival openness is its moral obligation which Mrs Gandhi and the “family” need to uphold”.Shekhawat in his reply to Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh’s post said, “The truth placed before the Lok Sabha is clear and on record"". ”The Nehru Papers were taken out in 2008, during the UPA period, when public institutions were often treated as family preserves,"" he said.“In fact it would be more appropriate for you to urge Sonia Gandhi to honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML so that scholars, citizens, and the Parliament can access these crucial historical records and the truth of ""Nehruvian"" times can be examined objectively,” Shekhawat said to Ramesh.","Culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress.

Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix likely to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coals-share-in-indias-electricity-mix-likely-to-fall-from-over-70-in-2025-to-about-60-by-2030-report/articleshow/126043648.cms,".

New Delhi: Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix is projected to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030, even as the country’s overall coal demand is expected to rise 17% over the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).IEA said India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on-year decline of 1.2%, driven mainly by a 3% drop in coal-fired power generation. Higher hydropower output following an early and strong monsoon, lower electricity demand for cooling and the continued expansion of renewable energy capacity have contributed to the decline.In 2024, India’s coal production rose 7% to an all-time high of 1,082 million tonnes (MT). While most of the output was thermal coal, India also produced lignite and metallurgical coal. IEA said production growth outpaced demand growth by two percentage points, supporting India’s strategy of cutting coal imports, strengthening energy security, and avoiding supply shortages and price spikes.The report — Coal 2025: Analysis and Forecast to 2030 — said coal remains central to India’s electricity system, with coal use for power generation in 2025 estimated at around 940 MT, accounting for nearly 72% of total coal consumption of 1,297 MT.India’s total installed power generation capacity stood at 495 GW in Aug 2025, comprising 253 GW of coal-fired capacity, including 30 GW of captive plants, 123 GW of solar, 52 GW of wind, and 42 GW of hydropower, along with smaller contributions from gas, nuclear, and other sources.While the govt continues to expand non-fossil generation capacity in line with its 500 GW target for 2030, India commissioned or began trial operations at 20 new coal-fired power plants totalling 14 GW in 2025, with additional capacity under construction, the report said.Madhura Joshi, programme lead for global clean power diplomacy at E3G, said India has made remarkable progress on renewables, with 2025 expected to be a record-breaking year. She said the decline in coal demand alongside rapid renewable growth signals positive momentum for India’s energy transition. Sustaining this pace of renewable and storage expansion, she said, would help India meet its development, growth, energy security and climate goals.IEA noted that non-power coal demand has emerged as the main source of growth in 2025. Industrial coal use is being driven by strong infrastructure activity and steady expansion in the cement and steel sectors. India, the world’s second-largest cement market, is expected to see cement demand grow 5%–6% in 2025 and remain elevated over the medium term.Capacity expansion by major cement producers, rising steel output — particularly through coal-based direct reduced iron — and coal gasification projects are reinforcing coal’s role in India’s industrial growth, underscoring the continued importance of both thermal and metallurgical coal.India’s non-power coal consumption is projected to reach 356 MT in 2025 and rise further to 470 MT by 2030. Overall coal demand is expected to increase 17% by the end of the decade, reaching 1,522 MT, the report said.China, however, remains the dominant force in global coal markets, consuming about 30% more coal than the rest of the world combined.","India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on- year decline of 1.2%, driven mainly by a 3% drop in coal-fired power generation.

The rest is likely to be set up by public and private sector companies.While the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is setting up four reactors with a capacity of 4 GW in cooperation with the Russia, he said NPCIL plans to set up another 17.6 GW of capacity with foreign cooperation as part of its roadmap to reach about 54 GW by 2047. The National Thermal Power Corporation has also entered into a joint venture with NPCIL named Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Limited to take up nuclear power generation and associated activities, and has approved the Mahi Banswara project (four units of 700 MW).At present, there are 24 nuclear power plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 8,780 MW, while eight nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 6,600 MW are at various stages of construction and commissioning, and 10 reactors (7,000 MW) are under pre-project activities, Singh said.","India is expected to have at least five indigenously designed and developed small modular reactors (SMRs) under the Nuclear Energy Mission by 2033.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: JDU MP and Parliamentary Standing Committee Chair Sanjay Jha on Wednesday said the panel has heard IndiGo’s side on last week’s flight disruptions, but the inquiry is still ongoing.“There was a disruption at the airport involving air traffic control, and a detailed presentation on it was given today… The pilots' association, airline operators, and the Ministry also gave detailed presentations… We have heard their side of the story. However, the inquiry is still ongoing. After that, maybe we will sit again,” Jha said.It comes after IndiGo’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Isidro Porqueras appeared before the committee, along with officials from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Federation of Pilot Associations.When asked by reporters about the recent nationwide IndiGo flight cancellations, Porqueras declined to comment publicly.""Sorry, no comments today,"" the IndiGo COO said.IndiGo, India’s largest airline, faced disruptions since last week following the second phase of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which reduced the number of night landings allowed for pilots.While all airlines adjusted to the new norms, IndiGo was the worst affected due to a smaller pilot buffer.The airline cancelled hundreds of flights, affecting thousands of passengers and triggering panic at major airports.A senior airline official said the disruptions arose from multiple simultaneous issues. “We will need a root cause analysis, which will obviously take time... the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role will be known after the root cause analysis.” He insisted that there was no question of inadequacy, describing the episode as a “learning experience.”The DGCA has earlier issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidro Porqueras seeking explanations for the operational failures.The ministry of civil aviation also directed senior officials to conduct on-ground inspections at airports including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Guwahati, Goa and Thiruvananthapuram to assess passenger hardships and airline functioning.Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu told the Rajya Sabha that the disruptions were not linked to the Aircraft Maintenance and Scheduling System (AMSS) but resulted from the airline’s internal crew rostering and operational planning. He emphasized that consultations on FDTL were held with all stakeholders and that passenger safety remains non-negotiable.To stabilise operations, the DGCA has directed IndiGo to cut 5% of its daily schedule, equivalent to around 110 flights. The airline, which normally operates about 2,300 flights daily, gradually resumed services and expects full operational stability by December 10.","JDU MP and Parliamentary Standing Committee Chair Sanjay Jha says panel has heard IndiGo's side on last week's flight disruptions.

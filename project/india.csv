NEW DELHI: February is likely to be warmer than usual with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicting ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month and ‘below normal’ cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India. The Met department also issued advisories, noting how dry and higher-than-normal temperatures during the month may adversely impact farm and allied sectors in terms of yield reduction.The IMD, while releasing a monthly weather outlook for February, also predicted ‘below normal’ rainfall over most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest and east-central India.The less rainfall situation during the month may impact the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops in terms of increasing irrigation cost, whereas the ‘above normal’ temperatures in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan could lead to “forced maturity” of crops like wheat and barley, leading to sterile spikelets and chaffy grains, resulting in yield reduction.“The crop advisories and impacts have been prepared by us in association with the department of agriculture, for which farmers need to be prepared,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while sharing the likely impact of ‘above normal’ temperatures on agriculture.He said, “Oilseeds and pulses such as mustard, chickpea, lentil, and field pea may show early flowering and premature maturity, resulting in poor pod development, reduced seed size and lower yields.”Warmer conditions may also favour rapid multiplication of aphids and othersucking pests, impacting standing crops. Vegetable crops such as potato, onion, garlic, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, and peas may also be adversely affected during critical stages like tuber initiation, bulb development, flowering, and fruit setting.IMD shared that the elevated temperatures can induce bolting in onion and garlic, reduce tuber bulking in potato, cause flower drop in tomato, and deteriorate cole crops, thereby lowering yield and market value.“Horticultural crops such as mango, citrus, banana, and grapes may experience earlyflowering, uneven fruit set and increased fruit drop. ‘Above normal’ temperatures may also reduce chilling accumulation in temperate fruits like apple, pear and peach, leading to irregular flowering and poor fruit development,” said the Met department in its Agromet advisory.It also underlined the impact on livestock and poultry, saying they may experience heat stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, decline in milk yield and egg production, and increased susceptibility to diseases if adequate cooling and hydration measures are not adopted.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicted ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month. ‘below normal” cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India.

"After Supreme Court rap and ministry reminders, 65 medical colleges still off NMC records on intern stipends: RTI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-supreme-court-rap-and-ministry-reminders-65-medical-colleges-still-off-nmc-records-on-intern-stipends-rti/articleshow/127831428.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: Even after sharp observations from the Supreme Court and repeated reminders from the Union health ministry, the National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns, with 65 medical colleges still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.On October 28, 2025, the Supreme Court of India took note of a public notice issued earlier by the NMC on July 11, directing medical colleges to upload details of stipend payments to interns within seven days. The court observed that although the regulator had sought the information, it appeared to be “dragging its feet”, as no action seemed to have been taken against non-compliant institutions. The bench expressed hope that the NMC would act on its own warning at least by the next date of hearing.Following the court’s observations, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare wrote to the NMC on November 3, asking it to examine the matter and take appropriate action. With no response forthcoming, the ministry sent a reminder on December 16.Earlier, in its July 11 public notice, the NMC had warned that failure to comply with directions on stipend disclosure would attract regulatory action, including show-cause notices, financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.Responding to queries, NMC officials said that out of 764 medical colleges in the country, 595 are eligible to train interns and are required to pay stipends. Around 560 colleges have submitted stipend details, while about 35 remain in default. Officials said the commission has issued multiple reminders, filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on November 11, 2025, and issued a show-cause notice on November 3, 2025, warning of action under the NMC Act. They added that responses from defaulting colleges are being examined and a final list will be placed before the Undergraduate Medical Education Board for action as per rules.However, the RTI reply dated January 19 stated that about 65 medical colleges were yet to furnish stipend details. The reply did not clarify whether this higher number reflected an earlier stage of data compilation or included institutions not eligible to train interns.RTI activist Dr Babu KV, however, said the RTI response does not indicate that any regulatory action has been initiated so far against defaulting colleges, despite the Supreme Court’s observations and repeated communications from the health ministry.","The National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns. 65 medical colleges are still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad

New Delhi: Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced “Operation Herof 2.0”, a large-scale military offensive characterised by synchronised attacks at dawn. While BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12. The local administration claimed to have neutralised 58 BLA fighters.“Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan. During the clashes with the terrorists, 12 personnel of the security forces and the police were martyred,” the Pak media reported, quoting the administration and adding that the attacks were foiled due to “timely and effective action”. In a post on X, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Pak security forces had killed 70 rebels at various locations across the province during the past two days.Spanning around 12 districts and especially targeting the provincial capital, Quetta, this offensive marks a significant escalation in regional conflict and is being regarded as the most extensive assault since 2024.The attacks involved use of suicide bombers and a significant number of women rebels at Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat and Pasni where bank, govt offices and Frontier ops HQ were targeted.The attacks coincided with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) top functionary Hafiz Hamdullah’s declaring that armed groups, not the state, now controlled Balochistan.BLA’s Hakkal media also released a new video footage showing commander Bashir Zeb leading armed separatist units on motorcycles.In a statement, BLA claimed to have brought under its control several areas of Quetta, besides Noshki jail and Pasni coast guard camp, police stations and the military intelligence office. BLA’s Majeed Brigade and Fateh Squad (or Fidayeen soldiers) participated in the operation.“The Baloch nation will defeat the enemy in every city, every street and every neighbourhood,” Jeeyand Baloch, spokesperson for BLA, said. Op Herof-I was conducted in Aug 2024 and saw at least 126 Pakistani soldiers being killed and scores injured.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced ‘Operation Herof 2.0’ BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively. This is the larger context in which we deliberate on the region’s challenges and prospects,” said the minister.","PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",CJI Surya Kant wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

What do salaried taxpayers, middle class, and the common man want from

Union Budget 2026

on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

NEW DELHI: Stock markets indices were trading trading in green in the Sunday’s special trading session ahead of the Union Budget 2026.The Nifty 50 was at 25,357.15, up by over 36 points, while Sensex was up by over 226.67 points at 82,496.45 , as at 11.05 am.The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had issued separate circulars confirming that trading will proceed as usual on Budget day. Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation.Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery fell Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.The steep fall extended to MCX shares, which slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit at Rs 2,145.25. Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-booking following Friday’s historic crash, which saw both metals post their sharpest single-day declines.Market participants are closely watching how the Union Budget and global cues influence the recovery of precious metals in the coming sessions.Also read: Gold, silver prices crash on Budget 2026 day; hit lower circuit levels in futures trade - what’s causing the slide? The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended. “Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs. Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7 per cent and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8 per cent , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2 per cent and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7 per cent, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8 per cent over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled. Equity indices have pulled back from recent highs, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers, and global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical tensions and trade policies continue to influence sentiment.

Parliament Budget Session

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone. She will also become the first finance minister to present a Union Budget on a Sunday, adding to the historic significance of the occasion.In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Union Budget a day earlier, on Saturday, February 27. Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That convention was changed by then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who shifted the Budget presentation to 11 am, a practice that continues to this day. Later, in 2017, former finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced another reform by advancing the Budget presentation to February 1 from the end of the month.The Budget 2026 will be delivered during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will lay out the government’s fiscal roadmap for the 2026–27 financial year. The Budget speech is scheduled for February 1, 2026, with the Finance Minister expected to begin her address at 11:00 am.The Union Budget is generally presented on February 1 to allow ministries and departments adequate time to implement proposals from the start of the new financial year on April 1.Viewers can watch the Union Budget 2026 speech live through multiple official and media platforms:The full Budget documents will be made available online soon after the speech, along with explanatory statements and annexures.The Budget Session of Parliament commenced with President Droupadi Murmu addressing members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 28. The first phase of the session is scheduled from January 28 to February 13, while the second phase will run from March 9 to April 2, with the session comprising 30 sittings.The Union Budget is a key annual policy statement that outlines government spending, taxation proposals and fiscal strategy for the coming year, and the 2026 presentation will be closely tracked across sectors, markets and households.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.

Can parents inherit dead son's frozen semen? Govt challenges Delhi HC order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-parents-inherit-dead-sons-frozen-semen-govt-challenges-delhi-hc-order/articleshow/127827961.cms,".

New Delhi: The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents.The ministry's appeal asked two main questions: Can judges create new heirs, other than a spouse, for children conceived after death, and can gametes/sperm be treated like inheritable property that can be passed on to legal heirs, other than a spouse, without a written consent.In Oct 2024, a single judge held that there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction if the consent of a sperm or egg owner can be demonstrated and directed the hospital to release frozen gametes of a deceased man to his parents.The hospital did not yet release the preserved semen to the parents, whose son, aware of his terminal condition, left his semen in a cryopreserved state.Posthumous reproduction refers to the process of conceiving a child using assisted reproductive technology after the death of 1 or both biological parents.""Under the prevailing Indian law, there is no prohibition against posthumous reproduction if the consent of the sperm owner or egg owner can be demonstrated.If the deceased was married and had a spouse, the issues would not have been as complex,"" the judge noted. Contesting the ruling, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Department of Health Research last week argued that the verdict ""rewrites statutory definitions to judicially create a new beneficiary class (""intending grandparents"") and treats cryopreserved semen as inheritable property devolving to legal heirs. ""A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the Centre's standing counsel, Radhika Bishwajit Dubey that the govt will first have to explain the long delay in filing the appeal before deciding if it should be heard.The ministry contended that the single judge relied on foreign jurisprudence where explicit written consent was present, ""an element entirely absent in the present case"", and underlined that the dead man was unmarried and ""left no written informed consent for utilisation of his preserved semen sample.""""A child conceived through posthumous reproduction at the instance of grandparents would have no legally recognised parentage under the Acts, which contradicts the foundational legislative objective of protecting child welfare and ensuring certainty of parentage prior to conception,"" the ministry submitted in the appeal, arraying, apart from the parents of the dead man, the private hospital and Delhi govt as parties in the matter.""The ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) Act and the SRA (Surrogacy Regulation Act), constitute a complete code and limit eligibility strictly to commissioning couples/woman and intending couples/intending woman respectively, and within prescribed age limits. Parents do not fall within the statutory definition,"" the plea insisted, urging the HC to set aside the 2024 verdict, adding that the judge ""improperly elevated emotional considerations and subjective capability into enforceable legal rights. ""The 2024 order said that, in the absence of a spouse, there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction, and directed the hospital to release to the parents the frozen sperm of their deceased unmarried son for surrogacy to continue his legacy.","The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents.

Why is Sharad Pawar in a dilemma?

Will the NCP’s numbers remain the same?

Claims and counterclaims

NEW DELHI: In Shakespeare’s classic Hamlet, the protagonist is torn by a dilemma over avenging his father’s death by killing his uncle Claudius. A similar Hamletian dilemma appears to have gripped Sharad Pawar over the merger of the two factions of the NCP after his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s death in a plane crash.While talking to reporters on Saturday, the veteran Maharashtra leader said that talks over the merger of both NCP factions were in the final stages. He claimed that even the merger date had been fixed -- February 12.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed -- it was scheduled for the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.However, in a contrasting statement, Sharad Pawar also said that it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger.After Sunetra Pawar took oath as deputy chief minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, it became clear that the NCP - with 41 MLAs - will stay in the Mahayuti government.The decision appeared more evident after Sunetra replied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message on X, thanking him for his “trust”.Now, it is for Sharad Pawar to decide whether he will compromise for the merger and agree to enter into an alliance with the BJP or not. However, Sharad Pawar has on numerous occasions said that he would not align with the BJP under any circumstances.Meanwhile, many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband’s death.“When one of them called up, a member of Sunetra Pawar’s family said that she and one of her sons had already left for Mumbai to attend the oath-taking ceremony,” a close associate of the Pawar family told TOI.The sources added, “The deputy chief minister’s post is not a constitutional one and therefore, there was no need to arrange the oath-taking function on the fourth day after Ajit Pawar’s passing. Had the NCP shown the courtesy of waiting for the 12th or 13th day of mourning before making their political move, the other group would not have felt slighted.”The Pawar family now feels that by accepting the proposal without consulting them, Sunetra has walked into a BJP trap, they added.Due to health concerns, Sharad Pawar has taken a step back from active politics. He was even absent from campaigning during the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In his absence, his daughter and NCP(SP) working president Supriya Sule has been calling the shots. She is also being projected as Sharad Pawar’s political heir. Now, amid merger talks, speculation is rife over who will take over as the leader of a united NCP — Supriya Sule or someone from Ajit Pawar’s faction.After the split in 2023, several leaders such as Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare rose to prominence in the Ajit Pawar faction. If the merger takes place, the Pawar family could once again gain control over the party, pushing these leaders to the margins.If a merger does take place, there is a possibility that several MLAs from both factions may jump ship due to ideological differences, bringing down the NCP’s strength in the Maharashtra Assembly.According to political analysts, if a united NCP decides to join the opposition, several party MLAs could oppose the move and switch to the Shiv Sena or the BJP.Similarly, if the party decides to stay in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those aligned with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition may resist compromising on Phule–Ambedkar–Shahu ideology.Meanwhile, leaders from both factions have made claims and counterclaims citing the late NCP chief over the possibility of a merger. While NCP leaders said that coming together for the local body polls was a one-time arrangement, several NCP(SP) leaders claimed that merger talks were in the final stages.Senior NCP(SP) leader Jayant Patil on Saturday said that late NCP chief Ajit Pawar was eager to reunite with his uncle Sharad Pawar and had held several meetings to facilitate the merger.“He visited my house on multiple occasions and held talks over dinner. He said he wanted to reunite with his uncle by getting over the past. On January 16, we decided to contest the upcoming Zilla Parishad elections together, and the announcement of the formal merger was to be made on February 12,” Patil said.This came after Ajit Pawar met his uncle Sharad Pawar on January 17 and reportedly held discussions over the merger.However, NCP Maharashtra state president Sunil Tatkare refuted any discussion on the merger, claiming that the January 17 meeting was related to local body elections and an agriculture-related event.This followed both factions contesting the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in both civic bodies. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won 27 seats and NCP(SP) three seats, against the BJP’s tally of 119. In the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party won 37 seats while Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, as the BJP secured 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his advanced age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.",Sharad Pawar says talks over merger of NCP factions are in the final stages. But he says it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger. Many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra Pawar’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband's death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824811,imgsize-480056,width-400,resizemode-4/sharad-pawar.jpg"

A moment of reckoning

Maharashtra politics has rarely been short of convulsions, but even by the state’s turbulent standards, the untimely demise of deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Ajit Pawar in the January 28 plane crash has thrown up a new challenge to the coastal state’s already fragile political equilibrium.The loss of Ajit ‘Dada’ Pawar goes beyond emotional, as it has ripped open cracks that had appeared to be sealed after the Maharashtra local body polls seemingly settled the near-constant realignments seen since 2019.With Sunetra Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s wife and a Rajya Sabha member, sworn in as deputy CM on Saturday, stepping into the role held by her husband, the state has formally entered a new and uncertain phase, shaped by the vacuum left bydeath.Sunetra Pawar’s elevation may have filled the immediate constitutional vacuum, but it has also foregrounded larger, unresolved questions about the NCP’s future, the ruling Mahayuti alliance’s stability, and the direction the state’s politics will take in the absence of one of its most influential power brokers.Ajit Pawar was more than a mass leader from Baramati or a powerful Pawar family scion.For allies and adversaries alike, he was a political manager popularly considered par excellence, a negotiator who understood the language of power, and a bridge between rival camps that otherwise struggled to trust each other.His absence now raises fundamental questions, and at the centre of this unfolding story is Sunetra Pawar.Her rise, propelled by tragedy, sympathy and political necessity, comes at a moment when the NCP itself is at a crossroads, caught between reunification and reinvention.The significance of the current moment lies in the arc of Maharashtra politics that has trudged through rupture and realignments. The first major rupture came after the 2019 assembly elections, when the long-standing BJP–Shiv Sena alliance collapsed over the chief ministership.The same year, in November, Ajit Pawar stunned the political spectrum by taking oath as deputy CM alongside rival Devendra Fadnavis in a pre-dawn ceremony, even as talks were underway for the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP.The government lasted less than four days, but the episode marked the first visible rupture between Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar.However, Ajit returned to his uncle and, interestingly, took an oath again as deputy CM under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) banner, an ideologically unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena (then undivided), the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, which was born after the Sena-BJP split.That experiment in power-sharing ended dramatically in June 2022, when Eknath Shinde led a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, bringing down the Uddhav Thackeray government.A year later, in July 2023, Ajit Pawar engineered a similar split within the NCP, taking a majority of MLAs with him into the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The Election Commission subsequently recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, awarding it the party’s name and the ‘clock’ symbol.These twin splits fundamentally altered Maharashtra’s political landscape. Power shifted decisively towards the BJP, which emerged as the principal pole around which regional actors revolved.Ajit Pawar’s entry into the Mahayuti government as deputy CM was widely seen as a masterstroke, and criticised alike, given corruption charges against Pawar, which the BJP itself vehemently highlighted.However, Ajit Pawar gave the BJP numerical stability to its government and leverage over its other ally, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections and subsequent assembly and local body polls appeared, at least superficially, to bring a measure of stability. The Mahayuti retained power, the opposition regrouped, and after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and other civic elections, the sense in political circles was that the era of constant churn might finally be easing.However, Ajit Pawar’s untimely death shattered that assumption.Ajit Pawar’s political journey was marked by ambition, controversy and resilience. Over three decades, he built an image as a decisive administrator and an uncompromising leader, particularly in western Maharashtra’s cooperative and sugar belt. Even critics conceded that he had an unmatched command over the bureaucracy and a reputation for keeping his word.Within the Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar played a unique role. For the BJP, he was both an ally and a counterweight. His presence ensured that the Shinde faction of the Shiv Sena did not emerge as the sole regional power broker in the alliance. For chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Ajit was a partner who could deliver numbers, manage legislators, and absorb political shocks.His death has therefore left a void that is not easily filled. While the government remains numerically secure, the internal balance within the Mahayuti has been disrupted. The question now is whether any other leader can replicate Ajit Pawar’s ability to straddle competing interests without destabilising the alliance.It is in this competitive political landscape that Sunetra Pawar’s elevation has become a centre of Maharashtra’s politics. Married into the Pawar family in 1985, she spent decades away from active politics, focusing largely on social work in and around Baramati. Her initiatives in sanitation, women’s self-help groups and rural development earned her quiet respect, but little public visibility.Her entry into electoral politics came only in 2024, when Ajit Pawar fielded her against cousin Supriya Sule from the bastion Baramati Lok Sabha constituency.The contest was as much about family and symbolism as it was about politics. Sunetra lost by a significant margin of over 1.5 lakh votes, reaffirming both Supriya Sule’s entrenched base and the limits of Sunetra’s political reach at the time.However, her subsequent nomination to the Rajya Sabha gave her a formal role and exposure to national politics. Now, in the wake of Ajit Pawar’s death, she finds herself at the centre of a leadership transition driven by sympathy, continuity and the Pawar family legacy.Earlier, senior NCP leaders publicly backed Sunetra Pawar’s elevation as leader of the legislature party, clearing the way for her induction into the Maharashtra cabinet. Within the party, her appointment is widely seen as a means of honouring Ajit Pawar’s legacy while pre-empting internal factionalism at a moment of uncertainty.While the names of Ajit Pawar’s sons, Jay and Parth, briefly surfaced in internal discussions, continuity emerged as the decisive consideration. That logic worked overwhelmingly in Sunetra Pawar’s favour. As Ajit Pawar’s spouse, and the most senior figure within his immediate family, the 62-year-old Rajya Sabha member was viewed as best placed to provide stability, particularly in a party where seniority still carries considerable weight in leadership transitions.Ajit Pawar was surrounded by a formidable cohort of experienced leaders within the NCP, including Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare and Dhananjay Munde, all veterans of organisational politics, the legislature and administration. While the party may not have resisted Ajit Pawar’s sons in the long term, given their lineage and legacy, Sunetra Pawar’s elevation required no negotiation even with the most seasoned among this group.Yet, the challenge before her is formidable. Sunetra Pawar lacks the organisational grounding and political toughness that Ajit Pawar honed over decades. As Deputy chief minister and a face of the party, she will have to navigate a leadership structure populated by senior figures accustomed to Maharashtra’s hard-edged politics, where personal survival has often taken precedence over party discipline.Ajit Pawar’s death has also revived discussions around a reunification of the two NCP factions. Even before the tragedy, there were signs of a thaw. The two factions had contested recent local body polls together under the NCP symbol, and leaders on both sides acknowledged that prolonged division had weakened the party.Several leaders have claimed that reunification was Ajit Pawar’s last wish, part of a longer-term strategy to secure the NCP’s relevance ahead of the 2029 elections.His reported discussions with Sharad Pawar and other senior leaders suggested that a merger was not merely tactical but deeply personal, aimed at healing family and political rifts.On Saturday, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar made a significant revelation about the future of the NCP, saying that talks to merge the two rival NCP factions were already under way and had progressed to an advanced stage before the sudden death of his nephew.If the merger does materialise, it will raise an immediate and delicate question. Who leads the united NCP?Sharad Pawar’s stature remains unmatched, but his advancing age makes a return to active organisational leadership unlikely. This opens up the possibility of a generational transition, potentially pitching Sunetra Pawar against Supriya Sule.Such a contest would not be straightforward. Supriya Sule brings parliamentary experience, a national profile and a reputation as a consensus-builder.Sunetra Pawar, on the other hand, carries the emotional weight of Ajit Pawar’s legacy and the sympathy of party workers still grieving his loss. The choice between them would reflect deeper questions about the party’s identity that would fuel a battle between continuity versus renewal and sentiment versus structure.A compromise arrangement, with Sharad Pawar as a guiding figure and a collective leadership at the top, is also possible. But Maharashtra’s political history suggests that ambiguity at the top rarely lasts.For the BJP, Ajit Pawar’s absence alters the internal dynamics of the Mahayuti. He was widely seen as the BJP’s leverage against the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, ensuring that no single ally could dominate the alliance. Without him, the BJP will have to recalibrate its strategy.One scenario is that the BJP consolidates its position further, reducing its dependence on strong regional partners. Another is that the Shinde faction seeks greater autonomy and bargaining power, potentially leading to friction within the alliance.Sunetra Pawar’s elevation could partially mitigate this imbalance, but only if she is able to command authority within the NCP and negotiate effectively with allies. Unlike Ajit Pawar, she does not yet have a track record of hard bargaining or crisis management.The possibility of the NCP breaking away from the Mahayuti and returning to an alliance with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s faction cannot be ruled out. Historically, the NCP’s ideological comfort has been with the Congress, particularly on issues of social justice and secularism.However, such a move would carry risks. Several NCP MLAs aligned with Ajit Pawar joined the BJP-led alliance precisely to remain in power. A sudden shift could trigger defections, weakening the party at a time when unity is crucial.Moreover, the BJP’s dominance in the assembly with 131 seats in the 288-member House means that even a united NCP’s exit would not immediately threaten the government’s survival. The real impact would be felt in regional power centres, particularly in western Maharashtra, where the NCP’s influence has traditionally been strongest.Ajit Pawar’s death has transformed Maharashtra politics in ways that are still unfolding. It has reopened questions that many believed had been settled, like the future of the NCP, the durability of the Mahayuti, and the balance between ideology and pragmatism in state politics.For Sunetra Pawar, the moment is both an opportunity and a test. Whether she emerges as a commanding leader or a transitional figure will depend on how she navigates the competing pressures of legacy, alliance politics and organisational discipline.For the NCP, the coming months may determine whether it reclaims its identity as a united regional force or continues to function as a collection of pragmatic power centres.And for Maharashtra, a state accustomed to political upheaval, Ajit Pawar’s absence marks the end of an era and the beginning of an uncertain new phase, where old equations no longer hold and new ones are still being written.","Ajit Pawar was more than a mass leader from Baramati or a powerful Pawar family scion. He was a political manager popularly considered par excellence, a negotiator who understood the language of power. His absence now raises fundamental questions, and at the centre of this unfolding story is Sunetra Pawar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127822524,imgsize-963509,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-31t203224955.jpg"

Zero administrative experience:

Cracks in the family?:

NEW DELHI: By electing Sunetra Pawar as its legislative party leader and subsequently elevating her as Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister—the first woman to hold the post—just three days after the untimely demise of Ajit Pawar , the NCP has swiftly filled two of the three positions held by the Maratha strongman at the time of his death. The third post is that of NCP chief, on which no decision has been made yet.However, the road ahead is unlikely to be easy for Sunetra Pawar, who is still grieving her husband’s loss while having to shoulder his responsibilities so soon after his death.Here are the challenges in front of Maharashtra’s new deputy CM:Unlike Ajit Pawar, who was Maharashtra’s longest-serving deputy chief minister with six terms, Sunetra Pawar is a complete political newcomer. She now faces the challenge of stepping into a high-profile administrative role without prior experience in governance, making her transition into leadership all the more demanding.Despite coming from a prominent political family, Sunetra Pawar made her electoral debut only in 2024, contesting the Lok Sabha polls against her sister-in-law Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar’s cousin. Sule retained the family stronghold of Baramati for the fourth consecutive term, after which Sunetra was nominated to Rajya Sabha.With her recent elevation, she will initially have to lean on party seniors for guidance as she navigates the complex responsibilities of leadership.Sunetra Pawar began the week as a Rajya Sabha MP, and by its end, she has stepped into the role of deputy chief minister, taking on all her late husband’s political responsibilities—an abrupt shift made even more challenging as she continues to come to terms with her loss.Ajit Pawar was a mass leader, as reflected in the chants of “Ajit dada amar rahe” during Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in. Being his spouse made her the most obvious choice to succeed him. However, she will now have to establish her own acceptability among the NCP cadre and ensure she carries forward the legacy of the cadre's ""dada.""The two NCP factions were reportedly set for a merger, with an announcement scheduled for February. They also contested the recent municipal corporation elections in their Pimpri-Chinchwad stronghold as allies, though unsuccessfully. Despite past divisions, the family has traditionally celebrated occasions together. Yet, NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar’s remark that he was not consulted about Sunetra Pawar’s elevation—and his daughter Supriya Sule’s decision to travel to Delhi instead of attending the swearing-in—suggests that tensions persist, adding another potential headache for Sunetra.","Sunetra Pawar is Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister, the first woman to hold the post.

PM to rename Adampur airport after Ravidas in dalit outreach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-to-rename-adampur-airport-after-ravidas-in-dalit-outreach/articleshow/127828197.cms,"New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi will Sunday rename the Adampur airport after the saint Ravidas, a revered figure especially among dalits, and visit Dera Sachkhand Ballan, the headquarters of the Ravidassia community, as part of continuing outreach to his followers present in big numbers not only in Punjab but in several other states.Modi's decision to time the renaming of the facility as ""Sri Guru Ravidas Ji Airport"" - demand for which was being made for a long time - with the saint's 649th birth anniversary and associating himself with the event and scheduling a visit to the dera underlines his emphasis on cultivating a community which is important to BJP in terms of not only its politics but also its larger cultural agenda.He has in the past years launched projects for the development of the birthplace of Ravidas, a Bhakti movement poet-saint born in Varanasi, which is Modi's parliamentary constituency, for building his memorial in Sagar in MP and visited Ravidas temples to pay tributes.During his visit, Modi will attend a public programme and interact with Niranjan Dass, the dera's spiritual head, who was awarded a Padma Shri this Republic Day eve.The dera is based in Jalandhar, a part of Doaba region where the concentration of SCs is higher than the rest of the state. While Dalits account for nearly 32% of the population in Punjab, more than any other state, they are nearly 42% in Doaba.Dalits in Punjab are divided in several subgroups, Raviadassia community, which comprises 10-12% of the population, is one of the bigger ones and Ravidas is a respected figure among SCs.Reaching out to the members of disadvantaged castes has been a part of BJP's drive, for its agenda of Hindu cohesion and has helped the party's growth.

Over 800 NEET PG aspirants converted from Indian to NRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-800-neet-pg-aspirants-converted-from-indian-to-nri/articleshow/127827163.cms,".

Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) that allocates postgraduate seats in various medical specialties has released a list of 811 candidates who have chosen to ""change their nationality"" from Indian to non-resident Indian (NRI) to get seats in the third round in 2025-26.Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota. In effect, therefore, conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats in high demand clinical disciplines.The 811 candidates found to be eligible for conversion to NRI quota include two categories - those who actually are NRIs or children of NRIs and a second category of those who can show themselves to be wards of first degree or second degree relatives who are NRIs.There are 113 candidates in the first group and 698 in the second group.The lowest score among non-resident Indians in the first category is 82 out of 800, or just over 10%, while it is 28 (3.5%) in the second category.In the first category, 75 (66%) candidates scored less than 215, which means their rank is below 1.5 lakh.Over 60% (422) of 698 candidates in the second category of non-resident Indian are below 1.5 lakh rank.But with deep pockets, these candidates can afford the NRI quota fees for any specialty.Annual fees for NRI quota PG seats in a clinical specialty could be as high as Rs 45 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per year, depending on the specialty, state and on whether the medical college is a deemed university.If courts and the govt did not allow conversion of Indians to NRIs, many of the NRI quota seats would remain unfilled and would have to be converted into management seats where the fees would be much less.However, with even courts accepting the argument that private medical colleges cannot afford any financial loss, definition of NRIs has been expanded to allow candidates who don't have NRI parents or siblings to show themselves as a ward of near relatives, including NRI uncles, aunts or grandparents, who can sponsor them.","Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota. conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827180,imgsize-8140,width-400,resizemode-4/over-800-neet-pg-aspirants-converted-from-indian-to-nri.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools.

NEW DELHI: 2026 may see the Congress win another state. If the local body election results in Kerala are an indication to go by, the state may turn to Congress-led UDF after 10 years. So far so good. But what after that? Will Kerala go the Karnataka way for the Congress? Will the victory, if it happens, be overshadowed by factionalism and power tussle in the state unit?For quite some time now, the Congress in Kerala has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Shashi Tharoor, who was for many years the brightest Congress star in Kerala and also a symbol of inner party democracy, has of late been a source of constant embarrassment for the grand-old party. Tharoor, whose differences with the Congress leadership have made headlines, has given the party’s rivals, especially the BJP, enough political fodder to undermine the leadership of the Gandhis.So, what did the Congress leadership do to solve this crisis? Well, nothing for almost a year. After a prolonged dilly-dally, as the election approaches, the top leadership finally gave an audience to Tharoor to send out a message that “all is well”. However, we still do not know the outcome of this truce meeting. Tharoor has now claimed that he is on “same page” with the leadership and ready to campaign for the party.Unfortunately, this dilly-dally approach of the top Congress leadership in Kerala is not an exception.When it comes to power tussles in states, the Congress high command has been found procrastinating, shying away from taking hard decisions - one way or the other. This has led to unpleasant situations and even political desertions in some cases. Several Congress leaders have left the party in the last 12 years claiming the high command did little to resolve disputes.","If local body election results in Kerala are an indication to go by, the state may turn to Congress-led UDF after 10 years.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Focus shifts to improving existing cities, says expert privy to 16th FC

New Delhi: With just two months to go for the award of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) to end (March 31), the Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years. Similarly, there has been little progress on checking air pollution in cities with a million-plus population.After the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh recommended the challenge fund to incubate new cities as a pilot to promote planned urbanisation and ease pressure on existing cities, the housing and urban affairs ministry invited proposals and received 28 of them from 23 states. But it has so far not finalised even a single city for the purpose, having failed to complete the evaluation exercise.""This is one of the areas where the desired targets have not been met,"" said an expert.We have understood well that we need to improve our existing cities and urban areas rather than creating new ones. Naya Raipur is a live example for all of us,” said the expert privy to the deliberations of the 16th Finance Commission, led by Arvind Panagariya, whose recommendations will be tabled in Parliament on Sunday.The award of the 16th FC will cover the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31.The 15th FC had also designated the housing and urban affairs ministry as the nodal entity for grants to million-plus population cities for initiating measures to check air pollution by using mechanical sweeping machines, promoting non-motorised transport (pedestrian and bicycle) and paving side flanks of roads with facility for water percolation. The outcome of this exercise is awaited, with a report likely to be tabled in Parliament.Similarly, six years after the announcement to launch a new scheme to improve city bus availability, not a single bus has been deployed under the scheme yet. In Feb 2020, govt had announced that the Rs 18,000 crore scheme would facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.The Economic Survey presented in Parliament this week mentioned that govt has launched PM e-Bus Sewa to strengthen city bus operations with 10,000 e-buses on a PPP model.It said, “Official status notes for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses approved across 14 states and four UTs, Rs 983.75 crore sanctioned for depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure and Rs 437.5 crore already disbursed.” The report said that despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. It added that housing and urban affairs ministry has recommended 40-60 buses per one lakh population; yet, many cities have far fewer buses. “Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its urban residents. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-to-door travel times,” the survey said.","The Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years.

New Delhi: Forty-nine districts across eight states - Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, UP and West Bengal - contribute a major share of construction workers engaged in highway projects across the country, according to a mapping of labour origins carried out by the National Highways Authority of India.In a first-of-its-kind exercise, NHAI has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites, in a move to provide targeted skill training to these labourers. ""This will enhance their employability. Trained manpower in highway projects will help ensure timely completion and better quality of work. Training of people working at project sites is crucial,"" said an official.Officials said PM Modi recently directed the road transport ministry to undertake a focused skill development drive for labourers and supervisory staff by launching dedicated training courses.TOI has learned that a detailed framework is being prepared to train workers from these identified localities, and prominent ITIs, diploma colleges and engineering institutes have been shortlisted for the purpose. NHAI will sign MoUs with the institutes for training.It will also work closely with highway developers to implement the programme.People involved in the plan said while NHAI will provide a seed fund, highway builders are expected to contribute through their CSR funds. Trainees will receive a stipend during the training period to offset any loss of daily wages. ""Workers with 7-8 years of experience will be upskilled and developed as master trainers to train fresh manpower. The local NHAI project director will be in charge of implementation to ensure effective execution,"" an official said.He added that once trained, the workers will be able to get works anywhere and a better wage as well.Meanwhile, the highways authority is also preparing video training capsules on 50-60 topics that can be used to train workers.",National Highways Authority of India has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites.

New Delhi: Supreme Court has slammed the income tax department and a former revenue secretary, who now is the governor of RBI, for systematically harassing an Army officer turned Indian Revenue Services bureaucrat for over a decade and imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on the authorities.Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation. He cracked the tough civil services examination and was appointed to Indian Revenue Services in 1990 and rose to became Commissioner of Income Tax in Jan 2012.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, “Notwithstanding his promotion to post of Commissioner of Income Tax and imminent probability for further promotion, a trumped-up memorandum was issued to him, which was ultimately dropped. However, taking shelter behind this subterfuge, the petitioner was compulsorily retired.”“The order of compulsory retirement was ultimately set aside by this Court in an earlier round of litigation vide the judgment dated March, 3, 2023, recording strong observations on the high-handed and mala fide manner in which the departmental action had been undertaken.”Referring to the former revenue secretary, now RBI governor , as ‘the Officer’ without taking his name, the bench said, “Though considering the fact that ‘the Officer’ now holds a sensitive position, we refrain from making any observations on his role in the entire sequence of events leading to the present litigation.”The bench imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on authorities payable to Bajaj. It also directed fresh selection of members of ITAT from among candidates that would include Bajaj.Bajaj’s troubles with the I-T department began in 2014 when he applied for appointment to the post of Member (Accountant) of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Search Cum Selection Committee (SCSC) headed by a sitting SC judge placed him at All India Rank One. But the department did not appoint him to the post, citing his litigation with his estranged wife.On the directions of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the department’s objections were placed before SCSC, which rejected them and maintained his All India Rank One. Appeal against the CAT order was dismissed by Allahabad HC and then SC. Undeterred and adamant, the department initiated a vigilance inquiry against Bajaj and put him in the list of officers with suspected integrity.This move too was set aside by the CAT. Appeal against this order was dismissed by the HC. Later the department initiated departmental proceedings and compulsorily retired him despite he being empanelled by ACC for the post of joint secretary.The apex court in a hard hitting judgment on March 3, 2023 quashed the proceedings against Bajaj and set aside order of compulsory retirement.Bajaj moved a contempt petition against the revenue secretary in 2024 and the court summoned him for deliberate defiance of SC orders. The revenue secretary tendered unconditional apology on Aug 4, 2024 and the court directed release of all consequential benefits to Bajaj.He was not appointed as an ITAT member but was called for a fresh interview before SCSC headed by a sitting SC judge.",Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation.

Supreme Court

in Dec with a PIL to flag a blind spot in Indian law that leaves a small but acutely vulnerable group of acid attack survivors — those forced to ingest acid — without support. The hearing took an unexpected turn when the Chief Justice sought details of her trial, and called the delay a ‘national shame’. This week, the SC advocated tougher deterrents like attaching the accused’s assets to compensate victims. Malik spoke to

Mohua Das

about long waits for justice, patchy safeguards, and why survival demands more stamina than most people have.

Through your Brave Souls Foundation, you've seen how attackers face few consequences. Do you think these proposed measures can change that?

You went to court for

victims of forceful acid ingestion (VFAI)

, but the Chief Justice pulled up your own 16-year-old case and data from across states. Does it feel like justice is finally catching up or is it a reminder of what it takes to wake the system?

The law mandates free treatment to acid attack victims by both govt and private hospitals, and refusal is a punishable offence. Why does this still fail on the ground?

Is this free treatment meant to cover only emergency care, or does it extend to long-term and reconstructive treatment?

When did you realise that survivors forced to ingest acid were being completely excluded from the system, and why did it lead to this PIL?

Forceful acid ingestion is rarely discussed. How devastating is it for the body?

NCRB data shows cases rising again. Why do you think that is?

Acid sales are meant to be regulated. How easy is it to access acid even today?

What the Chief Justice said felt absolutely necessary. There should be punishment so people are afraid of committing such crimes. Right now, the accused roam freely. They get bail easily and face no real consequences. It has to be made difficult and painful. But saying it is one thing. Real achievement will be when this actually starts getting implemented. That is when conditions will truly start improving.The court could have limited itself to giving me relief only on the disability issue. Instead, it expanded the scope and raised larger questions around trials and deterrence. That gives me hope. Our judiciary should function like this consistently. We will keep filing PILs for survivors, but after CJI’s mandate, there should be clear directions on speedy trials, timelines, rehabilitation policies. That’s when change will actually happen.There’s absolutely no clarity. No private hospital gives free treatment to acid attack survivors, and frankly, they don’t want to.There’s no nodal officer, no coordination mechanism. The law simply says free treatment should be given, but when survivors go to hospitals, it’s outright refused. After that begins a long process. Once we approach the high court, the hospital suddenly says it is ready to give treatment “on humanitarian grounds”, but in reality, it is because of a court order. Even after that discrimination doesn’t stop. Survivors are made to wait for long hours, told beds aren’t available, even in big hospitals. Now imagine survivors without NGOs or lawyers. Who will actually get free treatment? Almost no one.In Parivartan vs Union of India in 2015, the court clearly said “full free medical treatment”. But that’s not how it works in reality. Govt hospitals are interested only in life-saving surgery. There are long queues, hygiene issues, and waiting periods of six months for a single surgery. If someone needs 40 surgeries, then 20 years of their life will pass. I myself have had 25. My left side still needs lifelong treatment but I’m tired. I don’t want any more surgeries.It was after the establishment of Brave Souls Foundation in 2021 that we were approached by VFAI survivors. When I began assisting these survivors with compensation and medical treatment, it became clear that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act entirely leaves out survivors who are forced to ingest acid. Their pleas for enhanced compensation are dodged and their disability is not recognised. That is why it became necessary to approach the court. If criminal law recognises this violence, beneficial laws must also recognise the resulting disability.This form of violence is rare but extremely brutal, often used as a method of torture, coercion or abuse, especially within domestic violence. The ingestion of acid causes immediate severe burns to the mouth, throat, oesophagus and stomach. Survivors experience extreme pain, difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood and swelling of the airway. Internal scarring can narrow the oesophagus, and require repeated surgeries. Many survivors cannot eat or drink normally and need feeding tubes.Most attacks are committed by jilted lovers or as a form of domestic violence. Many arise from family disputes or personal enmity. More cases are now being reported because people are beginning to speak up. But many acid attacks still go unreported.In Laxmi Aggarwal vs Union of India, the SC said acid sale must be regulated. But implementation on ground is zero. We have filed many RTIs most of which returned with NIL or NO as replies. Acid is very easy to procure and extremely cheap. It’s sold as bathroom or floor cleaner and shopkeepers rarely ask why it is being bought. Rs 20 worth of acid can destroy an entire life. That is what makes it such a dangerous weapon. At the very least, acid should be banned at retail shops. Even today, vendors sell it openly in residential areas including my own street.After a Delhi court acquitted the accused in your case citing lack of evidence, and after years of working with survivors, where do you see the system failing most?Poor investigation was a major reason my case collapsed. When the foundation of a case is weak, justice collapses. Besides that, the biggest gaps are lack of sensitivity and strict punishment. These are not ordinary crimes, but are treated like normal cases. Because of visible scars, survivors face discrimination in jobs, housing and social life. Many go blind and remain confined to their homes for years. Only three states—Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab—provide pensions. Even DLSA compensation, meant to be given within three months, is delayed for years. Survivors get exhausted and give up, or settle for a measly amount. Not everyone has 16 years or the resources to keep fighting.","Shaheen Malik, 42, was left blind in one eye and with a lifetime of surgeries. Her attackers roam free and she is still explaining pain to hospitals, courts, and a system that moves at its own pace. Malik spoke to Mohua Das about long waits for justice, patchy safeguards, and why survival demands more stamina than most people have.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127830821,imgsize-470421,width-400,resizemode-4/127830821.jpg"

New Delhi: Noting that Centre itself had framed General Provident Fund (Central Service) Rules in 1960, which entitled a valid nominee of GPF account to receive the amount lying in it, Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Manmohan rejected an appeal filed by Centre which said that in case the account has more than Rs 5,000, a nominee has to produce a succession certificate. The Centre’s plea was earlier rejected by Central Administrative Tribunal and Calcutta high court on the same ground that Rule 33(ii) allows a nominee to withdraw the amount.“This Court declines to entertain the present Special Leave Petition as Rule 33(ii) of the Rules, 1960 has been framed by the Central Govt and the same cannot be and has not been challenged by the petitioners...This Court is of the view that if the submission of Govt of India is accepted, then the purpose of having a nomination would be lost. After all, the process of nomination has a sanctity attached to it,” the court said.It said that if a succession certificate is required in all eventualities, then it would render otiose all nominations made under the Provident Fund Act, 1925, read with the Rules, 1960.“This Court further finds that the basis of cases (where amount is more than Rs 5,000 in a/c) falling in Section 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c)(i) is stated to be the amount standing to the credit of the depositor.While the basis of classification, namely, the amount of Rs 5,000 may have been substantial and reasonable in the year 1925, i.e., when the Act was passed, however, the same has ceased to be of any relevance a century later due to inflationary market forces. Recognising this ground level reality, the govt itself in the Rules framed thirty-five (35) years later stipulated that in cases of nomination, irrespective of the amount of money lying in the account, the same shall be released to the nominee,” it said.",The Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.

2-year central stint must for IPS for IG empanelment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-year-central-stint-must-for-ips-for-ig-empanelment/articleshow/127827920.cms,".

New Delhi: The Union home ministry has made it mandatory for Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to serve a minimum two-year central stint as superintendent of police (SP) or deputy inspector general (DIG), to be eligible for posting as inspector general of police (IGP) in the Union govt.The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards. The home ministry, in a letter sent to all state chief secretaries on Jan 28, directed that ""a minimum 2 years of central experience at SP/DIG or equivalent level shall be mandatory for empanelment of IPS officers at IG/equivalent level at the Centre from 2011 batch onwards"".The modified guidelines for empanelment of IPS officers for an IG-level or equivalent post at the Centre, are in line with existing guidelines for IAS officers. The latter make it compulsory for IAS officers to serve at the Centre for two years as deputy secretary, director or under-secretary, before they are empanelled for a joint secretary-level post in the Union govt.Apart from making available IPS officers allocated to different states cadres for filling up vacant posts in the central armed police forces (CAPFs) and central police organisations (CPOs) such as CBI, NIA and Intelligence Bureau, the new empanelment guidelines will ensure that IPS officers have a varied experience of having served both in their parent cadre and at the Centre early and mid-career, before they aspire for an IG-level deputation with the Union govt.As per the vacancy position in CAPFs and CPOs on Dec 23, 2025, 104 of the sanctioned 229 SP-level posts and 69 of the 256 sanctioned posts at the DIG level, are vacant.The last IPS batch allocated to various state cadres, to be empanelled for post of IG or equivalent, was 2007. The 2011 batch may be due for empanelment in the next three years or so, which gives them time to serve at the SP and DIG level at the Centre if they haven't served outside their parent cadre yet.Some states already experiencing shortage of SP and DIG-level officers may however find it difficult to spare more officers at this level, to fulfil the new eligibility criteria for empanelment as IG or equivalent at the Centre.","The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards.

Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint, says SC

New Delhi: In a significant departure from one-size-fits-all penalty approach, the SC has said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment and it would be justifiable to impose higher penalties on mega firms for environment damage caused by them, reports Dhananjay MahapatraThis decision by Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi was given while dismissing appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance in Pune.Justice Datta rejected the arguments of the two realtors that the penalty imposed was disproportionate.The court also rejected the arguments that NGT did not have the jurisdiction or power to arbitrarily impose such high environmental damage compensation charges.Justice Datta said through the NGT Act the legislature has deliberately given the tribunal discretion to grant relief based on the seriousness of environmental harm.The core of appellant’s arguments was that turnover or project cost cannot be taken as a metric for determination of environmental compensation. “We are unable to accede to such a submission. Neither NGT Act nor the jurisprudence of this court calls for the adoption of a uniform formula for the quantification of environmental compensation,” the bench said.The Supreme Court further said that: “In cases relating to protection of environment, linking a company’s scale of operations (like turnover, production volume, or revenue generation) to the environmental harm can be a powerful factor for determining compensation.”“Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint. Larger scale means more resource use, more emissions, more waste leading to more environmental stress. If a company profits more from its scale, it is logical that it bears more responsibility for the environmental costs. Linking scale to impact sends a message that bigger players need to play by greener rules,” it said.",Supreme Court said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment.

PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the citizens of Goa want an ""honest and people-centric politics"" in the state, and added that his party will work towards fulfilling their hopes and aspirations.Kejriwal on Saturday held a meeting with the party's local unit to discuss ways to strengthen the party base in the coastal state.The former Delhi chief minister arrived in Goa on Friday on his three-day-long visit.In a post on X handle, Kejriwal wrote, ""Had a lunch meeting today with the Aam Aadmi Party Goa State Committee and held detailed discussions on strengthening the organisation in the state."" ""The people of Goa want an honest alternative and people centric politics. Together with the people, we will work to fulfil Goa's hopes and aspirations,"" he added.During the meeting, Kejriwal listened to suggestions from party leaders, who raised concern over large-scale land conversions, destruction of khazan lands and damage to lakes and rivers.These leaders alleged that unchecked development supported by the ruling BJP was harming Goa's ecology and affecting local livelihoods.Addressing the gathering along with AAP state unit chief Valmiki Naik and Goa in-charge Atishi, Kejriwal urged party functionaries to build a strong grassroots network that genuinely represents the people.""Our strength has always been our connection with people. Strengthen the organisation at the grassroots and become the voice of Goa. Listen to people's problems, help them raise issues, and ensure those issues are taken to their logical conclusion.

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP's Tamil Nadu election in-charge Piyush Goyal on Saturday dismissed any impact of actor Vijay in the upcoming assembly elections in the state saying, ""we have seen many film stars come and go.""""I do not know what impact he will have on the elections. We have seen many film stars come and go. Having fan following and converting them into votes is a totally different story,"" Goyal told PTI in an interview, adding that there was no need for the BJP to woo the actor as they come and go.""You need organisation, you need people's understanding and confidence in you as an administrator. We have seen many film stars, we have seen Kamal Haasan come without any impact"" he added.Goyal further expressed confidence about the BJP’s prospects in Tamil Nadu as part of the AIADMK-led NDA alliance, claiming that the ruling DMK is facing strong anti-incumbency.""There is so much anti-incumbency against the DMK government. It is an incompetent and terribly corrupt government. Udhayanidhi Stalin (Tamil Nadu Deputy CM) represents a totally anti-Tamil culture and anti-India stance.

It teaches us to celebrate different viewpoints, different thinking, different ideologies and different religions,"" he said.He alleged that differences within the DMK’s alliance were becoming increasingly visible.""Prime Minister Modi never discriminates between people. He gives benefits to all, irrespective of the time of the year or the election period. There is a huge anti-incumbency against the DMK-led government.

Jhumpa Lahiri questions the mother tongue — and the need to belong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jhumpa-lahiri-questions-the-mother-tongue-and-the-need-to-belong/articleshow/127820568.cms,"Photo credit: Marco Delogu

In a literary world fixated on roots, writer and translator Jhumpa Lahiri has a confession to make: she does not believe she has a mother tongue.“I have no mother tongue...I don’t call anything my language. I never have. I’ve always felt outside of all language,” the Pulitzer Prize–winning author said Friday, during a press interaction before her session ‘After the Mother Tongue’ at the Instituto Italiano di Cultura in New Delhi. The event capped her India visit, which marked her return to a public stage in the country after 12 years at the Kolkata Literary Meet earlier in the month. Speaking at a panel, the writer indulged in a wide-ranging conversation about learning and writing in Italian, her life in Rome and the challenges of studying literature across linguistic and cultural boundaries.Lahiri, born in London to Bengali parents and raised in the US, dismantled the idea that identity must be anchored to a single native language, calling instead for linguistic fluidity, migration and creative trespass.‘The Namesake’ author, once known as the voice of the Bengali diaspora for her portraits of first- and second-generation immigrant lives, described a lifelong estrangement from the very languages that shaped her.Bengali, spoken at home by her immigrant parents, was emotionally intimate but structurally incomplete. English, meanwhile, arrived through school and the outside world and maintained its own distance as “the language those American people spoke, not us.”That double remove became, for Lahiri, not a loss but an unexpected creative condition. “This lack of a principal dominant language has opened up a different kind of space inside me to inhabit other languages,” Lahiri said. If she rejects the idea of a mother tongue, Lahiri is equally resistant to the idea that languages belong to particular people. “The most amazing thing about language is… anyone who wishes to can learn another language,” she said. “It’s an incredibly radical way to cross a boundary. I’d encourage young writers to learn other languages and resist a monolingual centre of gravity.”But she tempered that optimism with two warnings: against linguistic domination and against linguistic nationalism. She described English as a global force that can overwhelm smaller languages, while cautioning that the intertwining of language and the nation-state in projects of national identity is “very dangerous.” Writing in Italian, she said, is an act of engagement, not ownership. “I always maintain the outsider’s perspective. ”Lahiri's transition from English to Italian began around 2012. She relocated her family to Rome at that time. There, she temporarily renounced reading and writing in English to immerse herself fully in Italian. She first fell in love with the language during a 1994 trip to Florence, and later sought freedom from the ""overbearing"" perfection of her Pulitzer-winning English works. ‘The Lowland’ (2013) marked her last major work of fiction in English. Since then, she has penned several original works in Italian, including the essay collection ‘In altre parole’ (’In Other Words’, 2015), the novel ‘Dove mi trovo’ (’Whereabouts’, 2018), and the short story collection ‘Racconti romani’ (’Roman Stories’, 2022). Some are self-translated into English.Perhaps the most striking idea Lahiri offered was about “belonging”. When asked where she finds a sense of home, she pushed back on the premise. “Why is this question of belonging so important? Why can we not approach life as a positive drift, a journey, a shifting, as an evolution, as a largely nomadic experience with certain points of orientation?”Her years living and writing in Italian, she said, have been key in liberating her from the notion that ""we must belong somewhere.”Home, for her, is not tied to a nation or a tongue. “I find home in libraries. I find home by the sea. I find home with my friends, at my desk, with the people I love. I carry certain elements of home with me, like a tortoise. And sometimes home comes to me.”","Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri spoke at the Instituto Italiano di Cultura in New Delhi.

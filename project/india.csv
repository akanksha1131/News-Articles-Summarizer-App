'Seen hundreds of such lunatics': Religious body brushes off Pannun’s threat to Maha Kumbh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seen-hundreds-of-such-lunatics-religious-body-brushes-off-pannuns-threat-to-maha-kumbh/articleshow/116667525.cms,"The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad on Wednesday rejected Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun ’s alleged threat to disrupt key bathing dates during the upcoming Maha Kumbh, describing it as a futile attempt to create rifts between Hindu and Sikh communities.Earlier this week, the banned outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), led by designated terrorist Pannun, issued a video warning of disruptions at the Maha Kumbh scheduled to take place in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. The video, which surfaced after an encounter in Pilibhit where three Khalistan Zindabad Force militants were killed by UP and Punjab police, specifically targeted key bathing dates, including January 14 (Makar Sankranti), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya), and February 3 (Basant Panchami).According to news agency PTI, Akhada Parishad president Mahant Ravindra Puri while addressing the media said, ""If this person named Pannun dares to enter our Maha Kumbh, he will be beaten and driven out. We have seen hundreds of such lunatics.""Highlighting the harmony between Sikh and Hindu communities, Puri added, ""This is the Magh Mela, where Sikhs and Hindus are united. Pannun's attempts to instigate division are uncalled for. It is the Sikh community that has kept our Sanatan tradition alive. They have safeguarded Sanatan Dharma .""Pannun claimed the threats were aimed at challenging ""Modi’s Hindutva ideology"" and commended Bangladesh’s prime minister for arresting an ISKCON priest. He further urged Canada to ""rein in Indo-Canadian Hindutva organisations and Hindu temples,"" and even announced a bounty of USD 25,000 for targeting the Statue of Unity in Gujarat.Also read: Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) issues threat to target Maha Kumbh 2025 Puri downplayed the threats, describing Pannun’s inflammatory rhetoric as a habitual tactic to disrupt peace. ""We should not give too much importance to Pannun's statements, as his goal has always been to create unrest and attack the very fabric of our traditions,"" he remarked.The Akhada Parishad president also highlighted the spiritual ties binding the two communities and said, ""We have Naga sadhus in both our religions, and we are all soldiers of Sanatan Dharma. That's why we do not take such delusional threats seriously.""Puri also referred to the prominent 'akhadas' in Punjab, such as Bada Udasin Akhada, Naya Udasin Akhada, and Nirmal Akhada, which are home to revered saints.

‘We Need Skilled Professionals’

On Complex Visa Process

On Indian Democracy

German Political Crisis

Trump And Europe

A Trump-Putin Deal Possible?

On Competition With China

As Germany grapples with the double whammy of an economic slump and political instability — all in the middle of a raging war in Ukraine — German ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann , participated in a TOI editors’ roundtable to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues. In a freewheeling conversation, he spoke about the implications of Trump’s return for Europe and its likely impact on the war. Ackermann also addressed issues related to the tedious Schengen visa process and Germany’s efforts to attract more skilled professionals from India. Edited excerpts:■ Bilateral relations are at an all-time high. I have never seen such close and differentiated relations between India and Germany. The new element is migration. And the second one is that Germany has decided to become a stable security partner for India. So, we just got the latest statistics of arms exports and India is No.6 in the list, which is quite remarkable. Ukraine, of course, is No.1 but that’s not a regular arms production exchange. India is almost at the same level as the US...That shows how the German govt sees the Indian partnership and how strategic it considers the Indian partnership to be.Other than that, we have a very, very strong business connection. We have more than 2,000 German companies in India and not only the big ones, but also small and medium-sized companies who come here to try to unite mechanical production with digital solutions. We expect a growth in bilateral economic relations, not least because we very actively encourage German businesses to go elsewhere than China.■ Germany is in urgent need of skilled labour. We have changed our laws and I’d say Germany arguably has the most liberal immigration laws now. And that is a big difference between Germany and most other Western countries, including the US. We have one big disadvantage: language. But we have, I think, a certain advantage compared with other countries. And that would lead to an increase in the Indian community in Germany. We have about 260,000 Indians in Germany and that will grow over the next couple of years. We have good cooperation not just with the central govt but also state govts.■ I fully understand that the procedure (to get a Schengen visa) is seen as humiliating. (But) in the US, for a long-term visa, they ask me whether I have ever been a member of a terrorist organisation! (Laughs) The Schengen regulations are the same all over. There is no difference between Germany, Luxembourg, Estonia, Spain and Portugal. There are rulings made in Brussels and these rulings are relatively rigid.Now, let me tell you that we are doing 200,000 visas a year with an increase of 10% to 15% a year. Europe doesn’t have 10-year visas but we have fiveyear visas. We are very generous with long-term, multipleentry visas. I recommend everybody to attach a letter with their application form saying they want a long-term visa. It is not a category that you can click on but if you say you want to go several times, then our visa section is very happy to give you a long-term visa. We will digitise our visa procedure to make it easier. I think in the next year you will see much more progress. And then you should also not forget the waiting period for our visas is four weeks now. We want Indians to come to Europe.■ I’m convinced that Indian democracy works quite okay. Look at the elections to the Lok Sabha… people know ex actly what they vote for and why. When I talk to a Delhi autowallah, he tells me he votes for (Arvind) Kejriwal in state elections and (Narendra) Modi in national elections. There is a polarisation in India. But look across the world. Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands — (they have) govts with right-wing parties, which we would have never thought possible. So, polarisation is a bit of a global phenomenon... Solutions can only come from inside, not outside. I’m very encouraged by the force of the civil society here.■ After the coalition fell, there is now a very clear path to new elections. So, on Feb 23, we will have our elections, six months ahead of schedule. There are two big parties — the Conservative Party undera candidate who is running for govt office for the first time, Friedrich Merz, and the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who wants to get a second mandate. If you look at the (opinion) polls today, the conservative candidate has about 30-34% support. Social Democrats are in the range of 15-16% and the Greens are a little less, maybe 11-14%. And, then, there’s this right-wing party in Germany, AfD. They are nationwide between 16-18%. But then it is pretty safe to say that they will not play any role in the new govt. There is a firewall in German (politics) — this party cannot be part of any govt.■ I think we have at least a little experience of how our American friends will now govern and we are prepared. There is no doubt that for us times will be more difficult than under Biden, who was very European-oriented and a Germanophile. But I think from what we have seen of Trump, it’s possible to deal with a Trump administration, to find solutions with them.■ We would be more than thrilled if this war was over today, rather than tomorrow. It is very costly for everybody. The Russians, I’ve read, are losing up to 1,500 soldiers a day, and I’m not sure about the Ukrainians. It’s a senseless and absurd war. Now, I would say that any deal should, first and foremost, include Ukraine. So, is it possible for us to accept a deal between Trump and Putin that excludes Ukraine? I would say no. I think Trump also will reach out to Ukraine. If he cuts a deal with Russia and Ukraine where both sides can live with or agree with something, why should we not agree to it? The crucial point is the involvement and acceptance of the Ukrainians.■ The Germans were always very good with machine production. And what we see in China now, they are good and cheaper. So, in machine production, the Chinese have really caught up big time... German automotive producers really benefited in the last 15-20 years because they sold a lot of cars in China. But that’s not the case anymore. So, we are facing a certain economic crisis.I wouldn’t call it a complete crisis because we do have a little growth, but the growth is not good enough. And there are many reasons for that. We have growing competition with China and also the US to a certain extent. Another reason, of course, is the energy insecurity in the aftermath of Ukraine. Electricity in Germany is reasonably priced now. It’s not as volatile as it was after the invasion. We are in the middle of an energy transformation where 60% of our electricity is from renewables. Sometimes there’s no wind and no sun, and then the prices go up for an hour and then they go down. So, it’s a new energy system, which is good but is posing some challenges.","Philipp Ackermann: Bilateral relations are at an all-time high.

"BJP got Rs 2,244 crore contributions in 2023-24, Congress Rs 289 crore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-got-rs-2244-crore-contributions-in-23-24-congress-rs-289-crore/articleshow/116665702.cms,"Poll bond receipts not part of BJP, Cong donation numbers

NEW DELHI: BJP received around Rs 2,244 crore in contributions of Rs 20,000 and above from individuals, trusts and corporate houses in 2023-24, which is more than three times its donations inflow in 2022-23. Congress, on the other hand, received Rs 288.9 crore through the same route in 2023-24, as against Rs 79.9 crore in the previous year.As per contribution reports of the two parties for 2023-24, now available on the EC website, BJP received Rs 723.6 crore worth of donations from Prudent Electoral Trust, which also contributed Rs 156.4 crore to Congress. Simply put, around one-third of BJP's and more than half of Congress's donations in 2023-24 came from Prudent Electoral Trust. The top donors to Prudent in 2022-23 included Megha Engg & Infra Ltd, Serum Institute, Arcelor Mittal group & Bharti Airtel.Total donations declared by BJP and Congress do not include receipts via electoral bonds, as rules require this detail to be declared by political parties only in their annual audit reports and not contribution reports. The electoral bond scheme was struck down by Supreme Court in Feb 2024, leaving contributions, either received directly or through the electoral trust route, as the primary source of funding for political parties.Some regional parties, however, have voluntarily declared their receipts through electoral bonds in their 2023-24 contribution reports. These include BRS, which received Rs 495.5 crore in bonds; DMK, which received Rs 60 crore and YSR Congress that got Rs 121.5 crore through the now-defunct instrument. JMM declared Rs 11.5 crore receipts through bonds, though its other contributions were just over Rs 64 lakh.BJP recorded a 212% rise in its contributions in 2023-24, compared to the previous year, though this is not unusual since it was the year before general elections. In 2018-19, the year before 2019 general election, BJP had declared contributions worth Rs 742 crore, and Congress, worth Rs 146.8 crore.BJP received Rs 850 crore through the electoral trust route, of which over Rs 723 crore came from Prudent, Rs 127 crore from Triumph Electoral Trust and Rs 17.2 lakh from Einzigartig Electoral Trust. Congress received over Rs 156 crore through the trusts route, though Prudent was the sole donor here.Prudent also contributed Rs 85 crore and Rs 62.5 crore to BRS and YSR Congress respectively in 2023-24, both of which were voted out of office the same year. TDP, now the governing party in Andhra Pradesh, received Rs 33 crore from Prudent. DMK received Rs 8 crore from Triumph Electoral Trust and Jayabharath Trust.Interestingly, BJP has declared Rs 3 crore worth of donations from Future Gaming and Hotel Services in 2023-24, the company owned by Santiago Martin, also known as the 'Lottery King' of India. Future Gaming was the biggest donor through the electoral bonds route, with Trinamool Congress being the top beneficiary. Martin is under the lens of Enforcement Directorate and income-tax department for alleged money laundering.Among other national parties, AAP declared contributions worth 11.1 crore in 2023-24, down from Rs 37.1 crore the previous year. CPM's contributions went up to Rs 7.6 crore in 2023-24 from Rs 6.1 crore in 2022-23. National People's Party, which is in office in Meghalaya, declared Rs 14.8 lakh in contributions. BSP declared nil donations in excess of Rs 20,000 yet again. BJD too declared nil donations for FY 2023-24.TDP declared contributions of over Rs 100 crore in 2023-24, BJD nil and Samajwadi Party Rs 46.7 lakh as compared to Rs 33 crore the previous year.","BJP received around Rs 2,244 crore in contributions of Rs 20,000 and above from individuals, trusts and corporate houses in 2023-24.

Do apps charge higher cab fares on iPhones than on Android devices?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/do-apps-charge-higher-cab-fares-on-iphones-than-on-android-devices/articleshow/116665663.cms,"Once firms identify regular user, they inflate fares: Expert

CHENNAI: It's a theory that has been doing the rounds on social media, but is it true? Some commuters have noticed a curious disparity in cab fares displayed simultaneously on Android devices and iPhones for identical rides, which has left them wondering if pricing algorithms on ride-hailing apps are programmed to charge Apple users higher.TOI used an iPhone and Android device simultaneously to search for rides to the same destinations from three locations in Chennai. In each case, the fare displayed was higher on iOS (see graphic).A caveat - this is by no means conclusive evidence. The same searches on another day may throw up different results. Also, the pattern seemed to be limited to single rides and more pronounced over relatively shorter distances. For the record, Uber said it did not have a policy of personalising trip pricing based on the prospective rider's phone. It attributed disparities, if any, to factors such as estimated time, distance, and real-time demand for cabs in a specific area. Ola did not respond to queries from TOI.Experts suggest the disparities stem from how ride-hailing apps access hardware data to which users are required to give consent while installing an app.C Ambigapathy, managing director of ride-hailing platform Fastrack in Chennai, said the central server could easily generate fare estimates tailored to the user's device. ""It is child's play for companies to tweak fares based on hardware details while hiding behind the 'dynamic pricing algorithm' explanation,"" he said.P Ravikumar, former senior director of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Thiruvananthapuram, said aggregators were known to use rapid development tools such as machine learning frameworks (Google Cloud AI, and Azure ML) to refine pricing algorithms. These tools can incorporate variables like device type, app usage frequency, and search patterns to dynamically adjust fares.TOI was unable to independently verify whether that is indeed the case.An Intelligent Transport System expert involved in framing the Union govt's aggregator policy said fare surges weren't limited to differences between phone models. He pointed out that this also applies to frequent app users and those who repeatedly check fares on the same device. ""These platforms rely on user behaviour patterns to adjust pricing dynamically,"" the expert said.Ambigapathy pointed out that companies leverage past data to gauge user loyalty and trust. ""Once they identify a regular user, they inflate fares, confident that the user will eventually book, even if they wait for prices to drop, although they never do.""Ravikumar said it was time for companies to be transparent about their pricing models. ""If factors like estimated time, distance, and ride modes are consistent, users should not face discrimination based on their device.""",Some commuters have noticed a curious disparity in cab fares displayed simultaneously on Android devices and iPhones for identical rides.

260 Canada colleges involved in trafficking: ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/260-canada-colleges-involved-in-trafficking-ed/articleshow/116665640.cms,"Probe on over transactions of Canadian colleges and how much money they made from 'illegals'

NEW DELHI: Three years ago, on January 19, 2022, a Gujarati family - 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, wife Vaishali (35), daughter (11) and son (3) - froze to death on the US-Canada border in Manitoba while trying to illegally cross over to the US. The traffickers had left the family in the middle of a snowstorm at -37 degrees Celsius.Three years later, a money laundering probe by the ED against the agents involved in the Patel family case has found an international syndicate of human traffickers that includes at least 260 colleges in Canada that issued student visas to ""illegal migrants"" to take the Canadian route to the US.Those who found the student visa route more convenient, compared to the 'donkey route', paid around Rs 50-60 lakh each to the agents to arrange their student visa and travel to Canada before being ""pushed"" into the US. The probe is still under progress on the transactions of the Canadian colleges and how much money they made from such ""illegal migrants"".""Investigations reveal that to send Indians to the US illegally, the agents arranged their admission in colleges/universities in Canada and sent them on student visas. Once in Canada, instead of joining the college, they illegally crossed the US-Canada border,"" ED said.On December 10 and 19, ED carried out searches at eight premises across Mumbai, Nagpur, Gandhinagar and Vadodara on several agents who were involved in sending illegal migrants through these Canadian colleges.""During searches, it was found that around 35,000 illegal migrants are sent abroad every year by just two agents, based in Mumbai and Nagpur,"" ED said on Wednesday. The probe also found that around 1,700 agents/partners in Gujarat and around 3,500 across India were involved in this racket. ED estimates that more than 800 agents are still active despite a multi-agency crackdown on them.The agency said its probe found that at least two such agents based in Mumbai and Nagpur have signed agreements with several universities and colleges abroad for admission of students on commission basis. All potential illegal migrants are then prepared with required documentation for a student visa.During the searches, ED seized Rs 19 lakh in bank accounts of the accused besides seizure of documents and digital devices. The money laundering case is based on an FIR registered by Ahmedabad police against accused Bhavesh Patel, an agent involved in arranging the travel of Jagdish Patel (of Dingucha village) and his family in 2022.","Three years ago, a Gujarati family - 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, wife Vaishali (35), daughter (11) and son (3) - froze to death on the US-Canada border in Manitoba.

Bengaluru Digital Arrest: Bengaluru techie loses Rs 11.8 crore in 'digital arrest',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/digitally-arrested-techie-loses-rs-11-8cr/articleshow/116573799.cms,"BENGALURU: A 39-year-old software engineer from GKVK Layout, near Hebbal fell prey to a digital arrest fraud recently and ended up losing Rs 11.8 crore.In his complaint, Vikram (name changed) told North-East CEN Crime police that he lost the money between Nov 25 and Dec 12. Police termed the money lost as a huge amount, when compared to other such frauds.Vikram received a call from the mobile number 8791120931 on Nov 11 at around 10.30am. The caller introduced himself as an officer from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and told Vikram that a sim card procured in his name was used for illegal advertisements and harassment messages. The fraudster informed him that his Aadhaar was used to procure it. He said they have initiated the process of blocking the sim and a case was registered at the Colaba cyber police station in Mumbai.Later, another miscreant contacted him from mobile number 7420928275, claiming to be a police officer. He told Vikram that his Aadhar was used to open bank accounts for money laundering. They warned him not to disclose the call to anyone, including his family, as the fraud involved influential persons, who are already arrested in money laundering cases. They threatened to arrest him physically if he did not cooperate with the virtual investigation.Vikram then received a call from another number, 9997342801. The fraudsters made him download the Skype app. Subsequently, a person in police uniform made a video call, claiming to be from the Mumbai police. He alleged that businessman Naresh Goyal had opened an account at Canara Bank using Vikram's Aadhar and conducted transactions worth around Rs 6 crore.On Nov 25, another fake police officer contacted Vikram on Skype, claiming that the case against him was being heard in the Supreme Court and that the hearing needed to be completed. He threatened to arrest Vikram's family members if he did not comply with the hearing.Later, they told him that according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, they needed to verify his bank account transactions and instructed him to transfer money to accounts, provided by them for verification, assuring him that it would be returned.Fearing arrest, Vikram first transferred Rs 75 lakh to a bank account and later, Rs 3.41 crore to another account. By Dec 12, he had transferred Rs 11.8 crore to various accounts provided by the fraudsters. As the fraudsters raised more demands, Vikram realised he was a victim of a cyber fraud and rushed to police on Dec 12.A case was registered under the Information Technology Act and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections 318 (cheating) and 319 (cheating by impersonation).

GST Council's popcorn taxation sparks backlash on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-rates-on-popcorn-spark-backlash-on-social-media/articleshow/116601956.cms,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council's proposal to levy different tax rates on popcorn based on whether it contains sugar or salt has faced extensive backlash on social media, with two former government economic advisers criticising the taxation framework established in 2017.The GST Council, led by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.The Union finance minister defended the 18% tax on caramel popcorn, stating that items containing added sugar attracts different taxation.Later, the GST Council issued a clarification, saying that pre-packed and labelled ready-to-eat snacks will attract a 12 per cent tax while an 18 per cent GST will be levied if it is caramelised. There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

He said those trying to politicise the issue should not forget 2019 Pollachi sexual assault cases when AIADMK was in office.Investigators said the survivor was with her friend behind an old building in a desolate portion of the campus, close to Raj Bhavan and IIT Madras, when the crime occurred around 8pm on Dec 23.The complaint states that Gnanasekaran came up to the couple and claimed to have recorded their alleged intimate moments. He intimidated the male friend, a third-year student of the institute, into leaving the place and allegedly proceeded to rape the woman.Before fleeing, Gnanasekaran demanded to know the survivor's phone number and said she should meet him whenever he called her. He had been arrested in 2011 on the charge of sexually assaulting a woman on campus. It wasn't immediately known if the case went to trial. Police said there were still around 15 cases of theft and robbery against his name.Investigators have collected samples from the scene of crime and are searching for Gnanasekaran's mobile phone as they suspect that he may have stored pictures of several women on the device.","Suspect Gnanasekaran, who runs a roadside eatery near the campus, was arrested Wednesday.

""In the past, Congress govts just made announcements, cut ribbons, lit lamps and got photographs printed in newspapers. Their objective was just that and people never benefitted,"" Modi said.""After taking charge of the Prime Minister's office, I reviewed past projects and I was amazed. Not an iota of work was done on projects where foundation stones were laid 35 to 40 years ago. Congress govts did not have either the intention or the seriousness to implement these projects,"" he said.""After seven decades, there are still disputes between states over water. When the Congress governed everything from panchayats to Parliament, they could have resolved these disputes easily. But its intention was bad and hence did not make concrete efforts,"" Modi said.PM recalled that after the Vajpayee govt was formed, a serious attempt was made to resolve water problems. ""But after 2004, as soon as the his govt was not governing anymore, all those schemes and dreams were discarded by the Congress,"" he said.Wherever there is Congress, there cannot be governance,"" the PM maintained. ""People of Bundelkhand have suffered because of this. Generation by generation, farmers and women of Bundelkhand have struggled for every drop of water. And Congress did not think of a permanent solution to the crisis,"" he said.Modi asserted that Madhya Pradesh has become the first state where two river linking projects have started -the Parvati-Kali Sindh-Chambal linking project and the Ken-Betwa project.Modi said that he chalked-out the Ken-Betwa project of Rs 45,000 crore and encouraged BJP govts of both MP and UP.",Modi was addressing Bundelkhand farmers and BJP workers here Wednesday.

On commissioning, the 164-metre-long Surat will join the first three such warships, INS Visakhapatnam, INS Mormugao and INS Imphal, constructed under the Rs 35,000 crore Project-15B at MDL.“Surat is also the Navy’s first AI-enabled warship to enhance its operational efficiency manifold times,” an officer said. With an indigenous content of 72% and endurance of 4,000 nautical miles, these destroyers are armed with BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles, 76mm super rapid guns and anti-submarine weapons like rockets and torpedoes.Nilgiri, in turn, is the first of the seven multi-role frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at the MDL and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of around Rs 45,000 crore.All these seven frigates, with the requisite hull-shaping, radar-transparent deck fittings and other measures to make their detection by enemies difficult, are slated for delivery by late-2026.Vagsheer is the sixth and last of the French-origin Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’. India and France are now also in final negotiations for three more Scorpenes to be built at MDL for around Rs 36,000 crore, with the first slated to roll out in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each.Overall, the Navy now has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards. The 3,900-tonne INS Tushil, which will traverse the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the IOR to reach India, is to be followed by the delivery of another frigate Tamal by Russia in March-April next year.The over 130-warship Navy, with 251 aircraft and helicopters, also has the initial approval or `acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 155-160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.In contrast, China is constructing warships and submarines at an astonishing rate, while it has stepped-up naval forays into the IOR and the hunt for overseas bases. Numerically, it already has the world’s largest Navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including 140 major surface combatants.","Surat and Nilgiri were delivered to the Navy by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) last week.

""These days, all documents and communications are digitally stored, either in phones or laptops/computers. Where do you look for evidence if you don't recover them from phones or other digital devices?"" a source said.An SC bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal, while posting the matter for Feb 17, accepted Martin's prayer to ""issue an ex-parte interim order directing the respondents not to access and copy the contents of mobile phone iPhone 15 Pro"", besides other electronic devices (phones, laptops/computers) seized from his employees.The court also accepted his request for ""ex-parte interim order staying the effect and operation of summons"" issued to him. The agency, Martin argued in his petition, wanted his presence in the ED office ""for the purpose of extraction of data stored in the respective digital devices"" with regard to an ongoing investigation against him. ""In the meanwhile, there will be ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clauses (i) and (ii) of the application for interim relief,"" the bench said.Martin was the biggest political donor, with electoral bonds worth Rs 1,368 crore, and the biggest beneficiary was DMK, with Rs 509 crore of contributions received from him. The ED had fought to restart the investigation against Martin after two years of court battles where the PMLA probe was closed by an SC order after the Tamil Nadu police withdrew the predicate offence (FIR) based on which ED had initiated its money laundering case.The probe restarted last month after Madras HM asked Tamil Nadu police in Oct to restore the FIR as there was enough evidence against Martin to proceed against him. During a search on his premises in Chennai and Kolkata last month, ED officials seized Rs 12 crore in unaccounted cash and several electronic devices and iPhones. The ED had issued summons to Martin to appear before the investigating officer when his phone would be unlocked in his presence to gather evidence related to the case.","The top court has also put on hold summons issued to Martin for two months.

He was 91.As an accomplished chronicler of Nair tharavadus (traditional upper caste households) in terminal decline, Nair - aka MT - wove in lived experiences into seminal novels, starting from Nalukettu, his first. He won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi award at 25 for it.Asuravithu (The Demon Seed, 1962), Manju (Mist, 1964) and Kaalam (Time, 1969) trod the same path, as did Arabiponnu, which he co-authored with NP Mohammed. Randamoozham, which explored Mahabharata from the perspective of Bhim, was as radical as it was riveting. Varanasi, written in the late 1990s, was MT's last novel.At his peak, MT had a huge influence on Malayalam cinema too, where his themes reflected broad and diverse realities. His women characters, unlike those in his novels, were often liberated and lived on their terms. He wrote screenplays for 54 films and won national awards for Best Screenplay four times - for Vadakkan Veeragatha, Kadavu, Sadayam and Parinayam.Born on July 15, 1933, in Kudallur as the youngest of the four sons of T Narayanan Nair and Ammalu Amma, MT's literary journey began early. He quickly became known for his storytelling prowess, as well as his poignant and touching portrayal of the human condition, through stories and characters strongly rooted in his village of Kudallur.MT graduated from Government Victoria College, Palakkad, in chemistry in 1953 and taught for a while at MB Tutorial College in Palakkad. The proprietors of the college published a magazine called Malayali, to which MT often contributed. His first short story, Raktam Puranda Mantharikal, was published while he was studying at Victoria College. At 20, he won the first prize in the World Short Story Competition by New York Herald Tribune.In 1956, MT joined Malayalam weekly Mathrubhumi as a sub-editor and later became its editor in 1968.MT ventured into the film industry in the mid-1960s, when Malayalam cinema was evolving and seeking to find a unique narrative style and visual language. His first screenplay, Murappennu (1965) was followed by a succession of films that solidified his reputation. MT quickly became the most acclaimed and in-demand screenwriter in Malayalam cinema, penning some of the greatest hits like Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha.MT also directed six films, including Nirmalyam (1973) which won National Award.As literary editor, MT made seminal contributions to Malayalam literature by finding out and fostering a generation of writers. He won the Jnanpith Award in 2005 and was honoured with the Padma Bhushan in 2005.MT married writer- translator Prameela in 1965, from whom he separated after 11 years. He later married dancer Kalamandalam Sarawathi. They have two daughters - Sithara and Ashwathi.","MT Vasudevan Nair passed away around 10pm on Christmas Day after spending nine days in a Kozhikode hospital.

Plan to put Hasina on trial

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina ""We sent a note verbal (diplomatic message) to the Indian government saying that the Bangladesh government wants her (Hasina) back here for judicial process,"" foreign adviser Touhid Hossain told The Daily Star at the foreign ministry this afternoon.Home affairs adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told Dhaka Tribune: ""We have a prisoner exchange agreement with India. It will be carried out under that agreement.""The ministry of external affairs also confirmed receiving a note verbal from Dhaka and refused to offer further comment on the matter.""We confirm that we have received a Note Verbale from the Bangladesh High Commission today in connection with an extradition request. At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,"" the ministery of external affairs spokesperson said.Last month, Bangladesh's interim head Muhammad Yunus had announced that the government would seek Hasina's extradition from India. Hasina fled to India on August 5 this year after mass protests against her regime.The Nobel Laureate while addressing the nation on his 100th day in office, said that his administration would prosecute those accountable, including Hasina, for the numerous casualties during the student protests that concluded her 15-year leadership.""We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,"" Yunus said.""I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan,"" he added.Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, under the extradition treaty with India, plans to bring Hasina back ""to try her for mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August"".Md Tajul Islam, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), has said that Dhaka will file an application with ICT to issue an arrest warrant against Hasina. The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character.""However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.

NFL Matches On Netflix Are Not Off To A Good Start



Netflix Has Not Learnt From Its Previous Mistakes



One of the most anticipated matches this season is the match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers which will start at 1 PM ET today. The game will be streamed exclusively on Netflix but it looks like Netflix has not learnt its lesson of streaming live events and the live streaming is already off to a bad start, even before the match began.Netflix has not been able to improve its operations and now the NFL is suffering because of it. Kay Adams’ audio was not connected for the first 10 seconds of the Christmas broadcast. Not only could people not hear Kay Adams speaking but also the moment Mina Kimes began speaking, Netflix could not keep up. Out of nowhere, Mina Kimes’ commentary was cut off and Netflix started airing its popular show Squid Games’ trailer for the new season, which is releasing tomorrow.NFL fans were left shocked at this poor quality of broadcasting by the streaming giant, Netflix. As many got together with their families and renewed their Netflix subscription to catch the two NFL matches streaming exclusively on Netflix today, fans were left fuming. Many fans took to X to complain about the broadcasting issue. One user wrote, “ @netflix is already failing the #NFL @NFL livestream and the game has not even started yet. 😡😭 @NFL . I knew this would happened based on the Tyson fight experience. #SteelersvsChiefs”, another user expressed frustration about this exclusive deal between NFL and Netflix and wrote, “ Absolutely hate @NFL on @netflix . This is garbage.”At the start of this year, Netflix signed a deal worth $150 million with the NFL for the exclusive streaming rights for the two matches that will be held today - the Pittsburgh Steelers going against the Kansas City Chiefs at 1 PM ET today and the Baltimore Ravens going against the Houston Texans at 4:30 PM ET today. Netflix has promoted these matches for couple of months and while people had faith over how Netflix could pull off this job, people started having their doubts when Netflix live streamed the most anticipated boxing match between YouTuber Jake Paul and boxing legend Mike Tyson last month.Also Read: Russell Wilson goes above and beyond for Steelers' offensive line with $50,000 worth of luxurious Christmas gifts, including Louis Vuitton and exclusive rum Netflix completely messed up the boxing match with the screen freezing at important times which led to people getting really frustrated with Netflix. This cast a heavy doubt on whether Netflix will be able to pull off the two NFL matches on Christmas Day and Netflix reassured that this will be an easy task since they have learnt from their mistakes during the boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. But it looks like this was not the case since Netflix is having issues even before the actual game has begun.","Netflix signed a deal worth $150 million with the NFL for the exclusive streaming rights for the two matches that will be held today.

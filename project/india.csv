PM Modi receives Namibia’s highest honour

NEW DELHI: India and Namibia discussed enhancing ties in defence, maritime security, digital technology and UPI, energy and critical minerals as PM Modi held a bilateral meeting with President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah in Windhoek during the final leg of his five-nation tour.Addressing Namibia's Parliament, PM Modi also laid out India's vision for Africa - freedom to future - and said India sought to cooperate, not compete, and not take but to build and grow together.""Let us create a future defined not by power, but by partnership, not by dominance, but by dialogue, not by exclusion, but by equity,"" he said.""We believe that Africa must not be just a source of raw materials. Africa must lead in value creation and sustainable growth. Let our children not only inherit the freedom we fought for, but the future we will build together,"" the PM said. Some of the remarks by Modi are seen as a subtle dig at China, which has a vast presence in the continent, at a time many African countries are looking to diversify their partnerships.According to an Indian statement, Modi thanked Namibia for its strong support and solidarity extended to the people of India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.They agreed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism.

NEW DELHI: India strongly demanded that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters. It said these incidents, caused by undeclared hazardous cargoes, and structural and stability issues, have raised serious safety concerns.Participating in the 134th session of the Council of the IMO, port and shipping secretary T K Ramachandran underscored the need to reinforce international protocols related to packaging, declaration, stowage, and monitoring of lithium-ion batteries and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDGs).In a statement, the port and shipping ministry said, ""India delivered a principled statement addressing recent maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters.""Citing the proactive role of Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard in ensuring the safety of life at sea, the statement said India called for urgent enhancements in the safety framework for container shipping. India also proposed the establishment of IMO-led investigations into such incidents to help build global best practices, improve standardisation, and strengthen operational norms that ensure the safety and security of container ship operations across the world.There have been serious maritime incidents along India's coastline that exposed vulnerabilities in the current emergency response framework. The sinking of the container ship MSC ELSA 3 in May 2025 and the major fire and explosion on the container ship WAN HAI 503 in June 2025, off the coast of Kerala, led to the loss of several containers in the waters and the release of hazardous cargo and significant environmental risk.","India strongly demanded that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters.

It's Janaki V: Makers agree to rephrase film title after censor board objections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-janaki-v-makers-agree-to-rephrase-film-title-after-censor-board-objections/articleshow/122353760.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: The production company of the movie 'JSK - Janaki v/s State of Kerala', starring Union minister of state Suresh Gopi , agreed Wednesday to rephrase its title by adding the initial 'V' to the name, as suggested by Central Board of Film Certification CBFC also agreed to mute or edit the word 'Janaki' in two scenes, thereby ending legal tussle over the movie.The bench of Justice N Nagaresh accordingly directed the petitioners, Cosmos Entertainments, to submit the modified version of the film for certification. CBFC has been instructed to issue a censor certificate within three days of the submission.CBFC had informed HC that permitting films such as 'JSK - Janaki vs State of Kerala', in which lead character is portrayed as a rape victim bearing the name of a revered deity like Goddess Sita/Janaki, raises serious concerns regarding public order.CBFC made these remarks in a counter-affidavit filed as part of the legal battle related to the film. The affidavit stated that allowing such films to be publicly exhibited would set a dangerous precedent and open a 'Pandora's Box' for future productions.According to the affidavit, the lead character Janaki is shown to be sexually assaulted in the film. The film further portrays Janaki being cross-examined in court, where defence counsel subjects her to several humiliating questions.CBFC argued that posing such provocative questions to a character bearing the revered deity's name could disrupt public order and offend religious sentiments. Moreover, it pointed out that following the rape, Janaki is aided by a man from a particular religious community, while she is cross-examined and asked harrowing questions by a person from another community. This religious dichotomy in the treatment of a character named after Goddess Sita, it was contended, has potential to inflame communal tensions. CBFC emphasised that the determination of whether a film tends to disrupt public order must be made from perspective of an average moral person - someone of ordinary common sense and prudence - not through the lens of an individual completely indifferent to religious sentiments.The affidavit also cited the details of the themes of other films using divine names, including Janaki Jane, Sita Ramam (Telugu), Kallanum Bhagavathiyum and Malikappuram, and referenced prior instances where film titles were modified, such as Sexy Durga becoming S. Durga, Laxmmi Bomb changed to Laxmii and Loveratri to Loveyatri. CBFC also noted that the petitioner had not claimed that the film's substance, theme, or intended social commentary would be compromised by changing the title or the name.","The production company of the movie 'JSK - Janaki v/s State of Kerala' agreed Wednesday to rephrase its title by adding the initial 'V' to the name.

However, Suryavanshi perished trying to accelerate, caught by Alex Green off Sebastian Morgan.Middle-order batters struggled to convert starts, with Harvnash Pangalia (24), Kanishk Chauhan (24), and Deepesh Devendran (0) falling in quick succession.RS Ambrish was the lone standout, scoring a resilient 66 off 81 balls, anchoring the innings with six boundaries.India eventually posted 210 for 9 in their 50 overs, a total that proved inadequate on a batting-friendly surface.In reply, England made light work of the chase.

China's rare earth exports clampdown: Curbs backfire as local magnet makers reel from demand collapse; revenues plunge and inventories pile up despite US deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-rare-earth-exports-clampdown-curbs-backfire-as-local-magnet-makers-reel-from-demand-collapse-revenues-plunge-and-inventories-pile-up-despite-us-deal/articleshow/122303856.cms,"Share prices rebound, but outlook remains grim

Industry braces for long disruption and possible shakeout

China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry! China’s export restrictions on rare earths have disrupted the global auto supply chain, forced production halts by carmakers, and pushed US President Donald Trump back to the negotiating table—but back in China, the curbs have dealt a fresh blow to struggling Chinese magnet makers.Beijing imposed the restrictions in April in retaliation to US tariffs, severely impacting rare earth and magnet exports just as the domestic economy shows signs of weakness. Electric vehicles (EVs), a key end-use sector, are already facing headwinds, compounding the pain for magnet producers.According to a Reuters report, magnet exports have plunged 75% in the two months following the export controls, and several global automakers were forced to pause production. Although the US and China announced a deal on June 27 to restart rare earth trade flows, implementation is expected to take time.In a post on WeChat just 12 hours after the deal was announced, the state-backed Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange said inventory was piling up in warehouses and warned that the damage would not be reversed quickly.The Baotou exchange, located in Inner Mongolia—one of China’s major rare earth hubs—described the impact in May as a “crisis” for domestic magnet producers.Despite China producing 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, export sales remain critical. In 2024, overseas sales accounted for between 18% and 50% of total revenue for the 11 largest publicly listed magnet firms, Reuters reported, citing public filings.“Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends – disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” said Ellie Saklatvala, head of metal pricing at commodities information firm Argus. “They have temporarily lost an important part of their customer base, with no certainty about when they will regain it.”Two rare earth magnet producers told Reuters that revenue is expected to fall in 2025, though they declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. One producer said the export curbs would have a “huge impact” on business, while small- and mid-sized players have already slashed production by around 15% in April and May, according to another source.Much like US chipmaker Nvidia, Chinese rare earth firms are caught in the middle of geopolitical crossfire. After an initial share price crash in April, some listed magnet producers have bounced back—but analysts caution the rebound is not backed by industry fundamentals.“I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals research at Trivium China. He added that many players in the industry are private, limiting the insight that stock prices can offer.Magnet manufacturers are also under pressure at home due to a brutal EV price war, with automakers demanding price cuts from component suppliers. Complicating matters further is the customised nature of most magnet products, which makes them hard to resell domestically. Four sources told Reuters that producers are being forced to store unsold cargoes while they await export licences.Some companies have acknowledged the strain. Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co flagged potential export revenue risks in its annual report published in late April. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had received export licences and operations were running normally, while deferring financial details to upcoming filings.However, analysts warn that rare earth trade flows are unlikely to return to pre-restriction levels any time soon.“Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals – such as antimony – it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” said Argus’ Saklatvala, quoted Reuters.China imposed similar export restrictions on germanium and antimony across 2023 and 2024. Despite being mostly used in civilian sectors, which theoretically face fewer licensing hurdles, exports have yet to fully recover, customs data shows. Europe, for instance, is now receiving only a fraction of the antimony it once imported from China, leading to shortages for lead-acid battery manufacturers.David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said the export licence process now involves extensive documentation, leading to delays and added costs. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” he said.With the industry consisting of hundreds of manufacturers, the growing pressures could spark consolidation. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” Abraham added.","China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry.

UAE's ICP Denies Golden Visa Rumours

UAE Golden Visa : Rs 23 Lakh Visa Confusion

Has the UAE launched a new golden visa pilot programme? Reports about UAE launching a pilot programme for a new golden visa have created excitement on social media. However, visa consultants and applicants are confused due to lack of official announcements, leading to doubt and frustration.While Indian media outlets had extensively covered the news about UAE's new golden visa pilot, there had been no coverage in UAE media outlets or the Emirates News Agency, which typically publishes all official announcements. The story had gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) has finally dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities, according to a Emirates News Agency report.The Authority emphasised that Golden Visa specifications, requirements and guidelines are explicitly outlined in official regulations and government decrees. Those seeking accurate details can access this information through the Authority's official digital platforms, including their website and mobile application.The authority emphasised that legal measures would be taken against organisations disseminating inaccurate details whilst unlawfully soliciting funds from people who wish to establish residence in the UAE. Such entities take advantage of individuals' aspirations for a respectable and stable lifestyle.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic, and it turns out that it was a rumour.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant had confirmed to ET that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue.

*HRA exemption is calculated for non-metropolitan cities

At a gross income of Rs 7.50 lakh, the new income tax regime results in zero tax, while the old regime leads to a liability of Rs 16,640. Your total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 2.00 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 18 lakh, the new regime offers savings of over Rs 29,432, despite the old regime having a significant amount of deductions. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 5.59 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 25 lakh, even with more than Rs 5.25 lakh in deductions, the old regime tax is Rs 26,000 higher than the tax outgo under the new regime. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 6.08 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 75 lakh, even with significant deductions/exemptions under the old regime, the new regime still proves better by Rs 45,760. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 9.58 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

The above examples take into account individuals contributing to NPS (employer’ contribution). However, if one does not contribute to such NPS, for an individual having gross income of more than Rs 15.75 lakh, he/she is better off taking new regime only if the eligible tax saving investments under the old tax regime are less than Rs 4,33,333/-

ITR filing FY 2024-25: The choice of the income tax regime while filing Income Tax Return (ITR) is an extremely important one. Your final tax outgo is dependent on the tax regime you opt for, hence the choice between the new and old income tax regime should be an informed decision.Salaried taxpayers have the option to choose between the new and old income tax regime every year. As your financial journey evolves, and changes are made in both the new and old income tax regime, it’s crucial for you to do a final check on which regime suits you best before filing ITR for FY 2024-25.“The Government has over the years brought significant revisions, in the New Regime, making the choice more compelling—and more consequential—than ever,” says Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained If you are confused about the new versus old income tax regime and are still wondering which works out better for you, we have you covered.Before understanding the math to decide between the new and old regimes, here’s a look at the tax slabs in the respective regimes.The above tax slabs are applicable for resident individuals up to the age of 60 years. For senior citizens between the age of 60-80 years, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3 lakh.For super senior citizens the basic exemption limit is Rs 5 lakh.The tax slabs under the new regime are very different from those in the old regime, with new tax brackets and lower tax rates. However, there is no separate basic exemption limit for senior and super senior citizens.The table below by EY, gives a side-by-side comparison of the new and old Tax regimes, highlighting key differences in structure, eligibility, and suitability to help taxpayers make an informed choice.To illustrate how tax liabilities vary under each regime (for the Financial Year 2024-25), here’s a comparative snapshot across income levels for a Resident individual:Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI that an income-wise comparison of tax liability under the new and old Regimes reveals a clear trend: the new tax regime offers lower tax outgo across all income brackets, from middle to high-income groups—even when taxpayers under the old regime claim substantial deductions like HRA, Section 80C, NPS, and standard deductions. He explains:“These findings suggest that the new regime is not only simpler but often more tax-efficient, especially for individuals who may not fully utilize all deductions or prefer a hassle-free filing process. While the old Regime still holds value for some with structured investments, the broader appeal of the new Regime continues to grow, making it a compelling default choice for many taxpayers,” Amarpal Chadha tells TOI.Yet another detail that you should not miss is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime. While filing ITR, you can choose between the old and new regime. But, if the return is filed after the due date (this year it is September 15, 2025), then you will have to by default file ITR under the new tax regime, the option of old regime would not be available.Also Read | ITR filing: Why are ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms still not available on Income Tax e-filing portal?

"Bihar SIR: Electoral revision process shows Urban-rural divide; Aadhaar accepted in Patna, not in Seemanchal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-sir-aadhaar-accepted-in-patna-not-in-seemanchal/articleshow/122350645.cms,"Representative image

Aadhaar not valid here

PATNA: The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday. But the process seems to have thrown up an urban-rural divide, TOI found after speaking to officials and people across regions. While officials were seen taking forms on basis of Aadhaar cards in Patna, not many were willing to accept the card in Seemanchal and other parts of rural Bihar, where birth certificates or, in lieu, caste or land allotment documents were being insisted on.TOI hit the ground for a reality check and found that booth level officers (BLOs), Jeevika didis, shiksha mitras and Anganwadi sevikas distributing enumeration forms in villages and towns of Bihar at a rapid pace.In Patna and adjoining areas, voters said they have been asked to fill in and sign the forms and submit a copy of their voter ID cards, Aadhaar, or even ration cards, if they don't have any of the 11 documents required by the Election Commission.Don’t worry, just provide your Aadhaar card,” Rahul Yadav , a ward councillor, was seen telling a group of worried women.Aadhaar and ration cards are not included in the list of 11 documents mandated by the EC, triggering widespread protests from the opposition India Bloc.But, in reality, some BLOs in urban areas like Patna say they have been asked to just get the enumeration forms filled in and signed by existing voters and upload them as the EC itself says the other needed documents can be submitted later. July 25 is the last date to submit forms.Ramashish, of Bikram area in Patna district, said the BLOs distributing the forms had initially asked them to submit the documents listed by the EC.“Since very few people had any of the 11 listed documents, the villagers were reluctant. But now they have been asked to just fill the columns of mother, father, spouse names, Aadhaar card number and mobile number with signature. That may be the reason why the SIR exercise has gained pace in the last few days,” he said.Many voters enrolled in urban areas of East Champaran district are getting their names added to the voter lists of their respective villages where they have landed property, revealed BLOs in Motihari, Raxaul, Sugauli, Areraj and Chakiya.Shiwani, a teacher at Urvarak Nagar in Begusarai, said, “The BLO asked for my voter ID and Aadhaar cards and I faced no difficulty.” Kalyanesh Agrawal of Chatti Road locality in Begusarai said the verification process was smooth.Awadhesh Kumar Singh, principal of SBSS College, Begusarai, said the BLO visited his house and the process was conducted without hassle.In Patna, people were seen at Jan Suvidha Kendras in their areas to get their forms filled. Former councillor Bharti Devi said there was confusion among people about the documents required. “But we are getting the forms filled to submit them to the BLO,” she said.Born in 1949, Dukhani Devi of Mushari Tola feared her name would be struck off the voter list. “Some people in my area said I will not be allowed to vote if I do not submit some papers. I only have an Aadhaar card and voter ID card. Will I be removed from my hut,” she asked. She was told that for now an Aadhaar would do, bringing a smile to her face.However, the real challenge for the EC to seek one of the 11 documents seems to be in Kishanganj, Purnia, Araria and Katihar districts of Seemanchal region, where people did not have proper documents in place and were seen standing in long queues at block offices, desperate to get residential certificates.More than two lakh such applications have been submitted in Kishanganj district alone in the first week of this month. “This is alarming and should be investigated,” BJP’s deputy CM Samrat Choudhary said.About a dozen BLOs in East Champaran district’s rural areas, when contacted, said since the Aadhaar card is not a valid document and birth certificate a must for enrolment as a voter, they suggest that voters provide either a caste certificate or land allotment certificate or any specific family register.At least two to five members of a family have migrated to urban areas for a long time and are not available in the villages.In Rupani village, in Patahi block of East Champaran, around 25 families are facing this problem as they have no papers. “We have voter cards only and have cast our votes on that basis in earlier polls. The BLOs suggested that we enrol where we live,” said a woman voter.Those who are employed somewhere else are also finding it difficult to fill in the form. Shyam Bihari Ojha, a railway employee posted at Bongaon, West Bengal, said he is a resident of Babhangaon near Ara, in Bhojpur district. “I can’t afford to take leave to visit my village for the documents of my parents, as is required among the 11 documents. My father is not even aware of the electoral roll revision. My parents have no birth certificate or any other document, except Aadhaar cards,” he said.Vivek Kumar of village Ratanpur, under Haspura block in Aurangabad district, said his family of 15 electors received only four forms. “We have been asked to attach documents like a copy of a matriculation certificate, Aadhaar card, and residential certificate with each form,” he said. Since all the documents are not available, they might face problems retaining their names on the voter list.Dhananjay Yadav of Baluan, Ara, said he is a zilla parishad member but had not yet got the enumeration form. Satyadev of Bhakura village has 10 eligible voters in his family but got only three forms. Many in Ara, including Kamlesh Kumar, have similar complaints.A BLO in Ara said many voters — particularly the elderly — without birth or any academic certificate are reluctant to furnish their land ownership documents.In Bhagalpur, Indradev Yadav said he and many others were camping at Babupur as their diara area was flooded. “From where will we procure documents?” he asked. Manohar Mandal, Jitendra Kumar, Anil Rai and Bhairo Paswan, also from the riverine area, said this was not the right time for such an exercise.There was a mixed response in Gaya district. While many said the process was easy, some voters complained they had not received forms. Anwar Hussain of Murarpur, in Gaya town, said all his 13 family members filled the forms and handed them to the BLO. Anju Kumari of New Godown area said the BLO collected the forms with a copy of a matriculation certificate attached.","The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday.

AJMER: In a damning indictment of public infrastructure management, the Ajmer Judicial Magistrate Court Number-2 on Wednesday ordered to immediately close the newly inaugurated Ramsetu bridge that suffered structural damage last week after the first rainfall since its construction.Rajasthan's Rs 243 crore project, meant to be a symbol of urban development, now stands as a monument to alleged administrative negligence and questionable construction practices.Judge Manmohan Chandel passed the order while treating a joint suit filed by two residents as a PIL. The court has directed both the Ajmer Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Ajmer Smart City Ltd (ASCL) to submit their responses by July 11. The suit was filed on July 5, after which court issued notices to the district collector, AMC and ASCL. None of the respondents appeared on July 8 leading to a subsequent hearing on July 9.The closure order came on Wednesday despite the corporation's assertion that it had blocked one of the four roads on the elevated stretch. The court noted that since the same material was used in the bridge's construction, the entire structure posed a safety risk.The court's decision came after shocking revelations that the bridge, operational for merely days, showed significant structural deterioration following the season's first heavy rainfall on July 3. More alarmingly, court proceedings revealed the project proceeded without expert consultation, and relied instead on decisions made by a local citizens' forum. The pressing question that people are now grappling with is: How did a multi-crore infrastructure project fail so spectacularly, and who will be held responsible?","Rajasthan's Rs 243 crore project, meant to be a symbol of urban development, now stands as a monument to alleged administrative negligence and questionable construction practices.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister Pema Khandu declared Wednesday in a surgical swipe at Beijing for repeatedly laying claim to the northeastern state, and also creating what he called a ticking ""water bomb"" in the form of the world's largest dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra in India) river.""Officially, yes, Tibet is under China now. That can't be ruled out... but originally we shared a border with Tibet,"" he told PTI in Delhi on his way back from the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday celebration in Dharamshala.""In Arunachal Pradesh, we share three international boundaries - with Bhutan approximately 150km, with Tibet... and on the eastern side, with Myanmar approximately 550km.""Khandu, in his third consecutive term as CM and credited with strengthening BJP's hold on the state, made the remarks while seeking to ""correct"" the interviewer the moment he referred to Arunachal Pradesh bordering China.Pointing to China's ""forcible"" occupation of Tibet in 1950, Khandu said that if one looked at India's map, ""none of the Indian states directly shares borders with China"".The CM's statement comes amid China's intensified bid to stamp its authority on the Dalai Lama's succession. Union minister and fellow Arunachal Pradesh native Kiren Rijiju, said recently that the decision on who should be the Dalai Lama's successor should be solely his and in accordance with established Tibetan Buddhist convention.No government, including China's communist regime, should have a say, he said.On the dam China is building on the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, Khandu warned that the project poses an “existential threat” to Arunachal and its neighbouring northeastern states. He termed it “a bigger issue” than anything else other than the Chinese “military threat” hanging over the region.Khandu said Beijing not being a signatory to any international water treaty meant it “cannot be trusted”. “No one knows what they might do... Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed. The Adi tribe and similar groups would suffer devastating effects,” he said. The CM said that after discussions with the Union government, Arunachal Pradesh conceived the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project as a bulwark against China's intentions. “Since we cannot make China see reason, it is better that we focus on our own defence mechanisms and preparations,” he told PTI.","Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister says.

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit. ""He has assured (me) that they want to invest more and more in Bengal. And he will come to Bengal very soon and discuss (things) in detail,"" she had said then.","Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday.

KOLKATA: Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran came down to Nabanna on Wednesday to meet Mamata Banerjee - the first time a Tata Group chairman has done so in her 14-year tenure as West Bengal CM - to discuss future investment in the state.Chandrasekaran met Banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office, also marking the first face-to-face conversation between a Bengal CM and the Tata Group's senior-most executive since the group's forced exit from Bengal in 2008 amid the tumultuous Singur agitation (which was led by Banerjee, then the state's principal opposition leader).The Tata Group has a strong presence in Bengal through multiple entities - like TCS , Tata Hitachi, Tata Steel and Tata Global Beverages (formerly Tata Tea). There was no official communication from the administration on the subject of Wednesday's meeting but Nabanna seniors said it revolved around the availability of large land parcels in the state. Another topic that the discussion might have explored was the possibility of a direct Air India flight to Europe, they added.Chandrasekaran holds the post once held by Ratan Tata for close to two decades, and then by Cyrus Mistry. Banerjee has never met either Tata or Mistry after taking over as Bengal CM.The Tata Group (and Tata Sons ) chairman was accompanied by Confederation of Indian Industry director-general Chandrajit Banerjee. State chief secretary Manoj Pant, too, was present. Chandrasekaran left the city after the meeting, officials said.",Chandrasekaran met Banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office.

KOCHI: Vinitha Radhakrishnan's long vigil for her childhood friend Nimisha Priya teeters on the edge of desperation at the thought of what July 16 might bring.That's the date set by Yemen to execute the 37-year-old expat nurse from Kerala, convicted in 2018 of murdering her Yemeni business partner and kept on death row at the central prison in Sana'a since. It's a reality Vinitha and everyone else in Poonkayam village of Palakkad district still haven't reconciled to.""We can never imagine Nimisha killing someone,"" Vinitha said as the clock ticked on the fate of the ""honest, well-mannered girl"" who once walked the corridors of Dhathri Girls' High School in Kollengode with her.Poonkayam hasn't given up hope, though. Vinitha believes ""a last-minute reprieve through govt intervention"" could still happen. Nimisha's husband Tomy, a daily-wage worker and occasional autorickshaw driver at Thodupuzha in Idukki, prays for a breakthrough in the campaign to reunite his wife with their 12-year-old daughter, Michele, and her mother, Prema Kumari.""I can't bear the thought of my daughter losing her mother. All these years, I knocked on every door possible to save Nimisha, but nothing has worked so far. My earnest plea to the Indian govt is to step in immediately,"" Tomy said.Michele lives in a school hostel in Kothamangalam. During Nimisha's weekly permitted phone calls or chats from prison, Tomy updates her on the initiatives to secure her release.

NEW DELHI: A Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report on a comprehensive update on terrorist financing risks, released this month, has for the first time mentioned the role of 'states' as terror sponsors, something India has been harping on while seeking to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.India had identified state sponsored terrorism from Pakistan as a source of terrorist financing risk in its money laundering/terror financing risk assessment in 2022. The findings of the FATF reinforces India's position as for the first time, it has introduced the concept of state sponsored terrorism in its report, a senior govt official said.""Political and economic realities within states play a significant role in the close cooperation between criminal elements and terrorist organisations' operations and settlements,"" the report said, adding that weak governance-related matters, systemic corruption and high criminal levels influence the nature of terror financing risks.It stressed on the fact that criminal and terrorist organisations thrived in states with ineffective legal and institutional frameworks, experiencing widespread and systemic corruption, particularly ones which offered lucrative criminal opportunities. The report also mentioned widespread use of banking channels by terrorist outfits in Pakistan.The Paris-based inter-governmental body said Pakistan-based terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) had used non-profit organisations (NPOs) and gaming platforms to raise terror financing.""Sham NPOs are established or registered knowingly for the purpose of terror financing and used to raise, store and move funds, commonly under false charitable pretexts,"" the FATF report said. The report raised concerns on increasing use of gaming websites by terror outfits.","A Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report has for the first time mentioned the role of'states' as terror sponsors.

Political aggression manifesting in acts of violence like the Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad who slapped a canteen staff at the MLA hostel on Tuesday has also become a cause of concern. Some say the so-called ""language war"" needs to be curbed urgently.Puran Singh Rajput, whose family comes from Nathdwara in Rajasthan, runs a grocery shop in Mira Road. ""I was born here and know Marathi, but my father who has been in the city for over three decades cannot speak Marathi. I fear that tomorrow any activist can confront my father and humiliate him just because he does not speak Marathi,"" said Rajput.A taxi driver from UP, who did not want to be named, said his grasp of Marathi is ""30%"". ""I've been working in Mumbai for 25 years and picked it up on the job. I can answer basic questions, if someone wants to test me,"" he said, adding that this inadequacy has now led to a sense of insecurity.He said Indians should be free to work where they want within the country, and not be constrained by language. ""Maharashtrians live and work in different states and no one demands that they learn Bhojpuri in Bihar or Odia in Odisha. Then why do we, in Maharashtra, learn Marathi? This is nothing but politics, given BMC elections are around the corner,"" he said.Many say learning the language is an advantage, but forcing someone to speak in the tongue is akin to fuelling linguistic chauvinism, and using violence to ""punish"" those who cannot speak this language is simply lawlessness. They also blame the misuse of social media to amplify acts of violence perpetrated in the name of asserting linguistic supremacy. Shaikh Abdullah, whose Kurla-based bakery employs around 200 workers from different states, said in order to win over voters ahead of BMC polls, political workers are coining bigoted slogans and creating a climate of fear.

""One of my Maharashtrian employees failed in Marathi in matriculation exam while my daughter who has a Bihari origin topped in Marathi at the same exam.

Centre set to approve 110-km Bhubaneswar bypass; road to connect Khurda and Cuttack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-set-to-approve-110-km-bhubaneswar-bypass-road-to-connect-khurda-and-cuttack/articleshow/122348382.cms,"Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore.

New Delhi: Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore. The six-lane Greenfield Capital Region Ring Road, or Bhubaneswar Bypass, will work as an arterial road for three major cities—Khurda, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack. The new road will bring down travel time by 40 minutes, from the current two hours to 80 minutes.TOI has learnt that the proposal for the project has been cleared by an inter-ministerial panel, and it is likely to be approved by the Union cabinet in the next couple of weeks. The main purpose of the proposed access-controlled highway, which starts from Rameshwar in Khurda and terminates at Tangi (outside Cuttack), is to ease congestion in the existing 86-km section of the NH-16 passing through the three cities.The Kolkata-Chennai NH-16 passes through highly urbanised areas of these Odisha cities, and considering rapid urbanisation and growth in the state capital, Bhubaneswar, it is not practical to widen the NH. As per estimates, traffic in the state capital has crossed one lakh passenger car units (PCUs), leading to congestion. Officials said the proposed project is essential to address congestion and for the overall development of the region.The travel time on the existing NH is around two hours during peak hours, but it can stretch up to two and a half hours. The proposed greenfield road, designed for 100 kmph, is expected to reduce travel time to 1.2 hours. This will also help develop more urban areas outside these cities, sources said.As per the Centre’s policy for building bypasses, the Odisha govt will share 50% of the land cost. The total land cost has been estimated at Rs 1,029 crore. The project has been divided into three packages, and the entire corridor will have six interchanges, four elevated stretches, five major and 44 minor bridges, three rail overbridges, and 17 vehicle underpasses.Sources said the project will be built under the hybrid annuity model (HAM), and the successful bidder will have to complete the project in two and a half years and maintain it for the next 15 years.","Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore.

It’s time to govern, not just talk. Opposition days are over — now you have to deliver.

I should get a Nobel Prize for governance and administration for doing so much despite a lieutenant governor and various difficulties,” he said.Reacting sharply, Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of presiding over a regime tainted with scams.“Kejriwal demanding a Nobel Prize is laughable. The people of Delhi are stunned. If there were Nobel Prizes for incompetence, anarchy, and corruption, he would have surely received one,” Sachdeva said.He cited alleged scams during Kejriwal’s tenure — including the controversial renovation of his official residence, dubbed the “Sheesh Mahal” by BJP, and other issues such as the classroom construction project, liquor policy, and pension schemes.Kejriwal, who served as Delhi chief minister from 2015 until September 2024, had defended his governance model at the Chandigarh event, claiming that it was rooted in honesty.“If a government is corrupt, if its ministers are looting, this model will collapse,” he said, adding that the AAP model had also shown results in Punjab.“Previous governments claimed the treasury was empty. But we fixed schools and hospitals, gave free electricity — because we curbed corruption and saved public money,” he added.Taking aim at the current BJP administration in Delhi, Kejriwal alleged that services had “collapsed” since the AAP exited office.Sachdeva countered that Delhi’s residents had not forgotten the “scams” that took place under AAP’s watch — citing issues like panic buttons in buses and mismanagement of welfare schemes for women.",Virendra Sachdeva calls Arvind Kejriwal's comment that he deserves a Nobel Prize 'laughable' Delhi BJP chief says former chief minister would be better suited for awards in 'corruption' and 'incompetence' Kejriwal's comments were made during the release of the Punjabi edition of the Kejriwal Model in Chandigarh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122348690,imgsize-797378,width-400,resizemode-4/122348690.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Telangana police on Wednesday arrested five people, including three of the most senior office-bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), in a case of forgery and misappropriation of funds. Among those arrested are president A Jagan Mohan Rao, treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante. Two top executives of a city-based cricket club too have been arrested. The role of another senior HCA office bearer is being probed.Sources said the investigators also took into account the findings of a vigilance and enforcement inquiry report on allegations against the HCA chief and others of harassing the SRH management for free tickets during IPL.Based on a complaint by Dharam Gurava Reddy, general secretary of Telangana Cricket Association (TCA), filed on June 9, CID filed a case under Sections 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating) read with 34 (common intention).TCA is not recognised by BCCI . The complainant alleged president A Jagan Mohan Rao contested the HCA elections using a forged document. It was also alleged Rao, along with some HCA apex council members, misappropriated over Rs 2.3 crore from the association.CID officials told TOI they discovered Rao had used a forged cricket club membership to qualify for the 2023 HCA elections. ""Rao furnished a forged membership of Gowlipura Cricket Club to contest in the elections and won,"" said a CID official.CID arrested Gowlipura Cricket Club president G Kavita and her husband Rajender Yadav, who is the general secretary of the club, for aiding Rao in committing the offence. CID officials also alleged that Rao, along with treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante, who are apex council members of HCA, misappropriated HCA funds under the guise of performing their official duties.CID picked up Rao from his residence in Gachibowli, Srinivas from Padma Rao Nagarand Kante from Begumpet. Rajender Yadav and Kavita were taken into custody later in the night.HCA had copped a lot of flak this IPL season over excessive demands for complimentary passes. SRH had alleged illtreatment by HCA and threatened to shift their operations out of the city. The team management alleged that as against the agreement of giving 3,900 complimentary passes to the association for every match — 10% of the stadium’s capacity — the HCA president was asking for 20 more passes. The issue even threatened to derail a match between SRH and LSG.","Among those arrested are president A Jagan Mohan Rao, treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante.

BHOPAL: She never mated, yet raised generations of calves. She survived brutal attacks, lived through blindness, and stood as a matriarch in the forests of Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh for over three decades. But when Vatsala died this week, the gentle elephant did so just short of global recognition - because of one missing document.On Tuesday, Vatsala collapsed into a pit near Hinauta Elephant Camp and could not rise. Her body finally gave way. Forest officials said she was more than 100 years old - a contender for Guinness Book of World Records - but could not secure the title. ""Without official records from her early life or veterinary documentation from the time of her capture, we couldn't meet the strict criteria set by Guinness. We were so close,"" said a senior officer.Vatsala was brought from Kerala to MP's Narmadapuram in 1971, already around 50. She understood only Malayalam then, silent before the Hindi- and Gondi-speaking mahouts of MP. But she eventually bonded with Maniram Gond, the mahout assigned to her in 1994, when both were transferred to Panna.""When I first called her, she didn't even blink,"" said Maniram. ""We were strangers - two beings from different worlds.""But over 30 years together, they formed a bond beyond language. ""She began to understand my tone, my touch. Even without words, we figured each other out.""Known across the reserve for her calm temperament, Vatsala allowed schoolchildren to play beneath her belly. ""She was like a grandmother,"" said Maniram. Though she never bore calves, she mothered many. Called 'Dadi' by staff, she nurtured young elephants, guiding and protecting them while keeping a deliberate distance from males.That refusal triggered one of the darkest moments in her life. In 2003 and again in 2008, a male named Rambhahdur attacked her when she resisted his mating attempts. ""He tore her stomach open. Her intestines were out. It took nine months to treat her,"" Maniram said. Vatsala never retaliated.By 2004, her eyesight had deteriorated completely. She was retired from patrol duty and placed under Maniram's full-time care. ""Even fully blind, she'd raise her trunk when I called her name,"" he said.Officials had sent tusk samples to labs to verify her age through scientific analysis. ""There's no forensic system available to determine exact age,"" said APCCF (Wildlife) L Krishnamurthy, ""but she would be remembered forever.""","Vatsala, who forest officials said was over a 100 years old, died in Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday.

The bench asked the petitioners to view the censored version and come back to the court on Thursday.Earlier, Sibal argued that while free speech is protected, ""the film's intent appears to fuel communal disharmony"". ASG Chetan Sharma, appearing for I&B ministry and CBFC, responded that the censor board had already removed the flagged content. Sibal, however, maintained that the movie's ""overall tone remains problematic"", and the entire purpose appeared to be to target an entire community.The petitioners said while Lal was murdered by two fanatics, the movie's trailer, released on June 26, ""falsely"" showed the crime being carried out with the complicity of religious heads/leaders of the community.The producer informed the court that the trailer had been removed, but Sibal responded that the damage was already done.The petitioners also claimed that the film violated constitutional morality by weaponising the freedom of expression to weaken the constitutional vision of a plural, inclusive and secular India, and instead attempted to mainstream narratives that would deepen social and religious divisions.Lal was beheaded in his shop in June 2022 by Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous -- who recorded the act and circulated the clip - allegedly for his post supporting former BJP leader Nupur Sharma over her controversial remarks on Prophet Mohammed.","'Udaipur Files' is a movie based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal murder case.

JHUNJHUNU: Two Indian Air Force pilots were killed after a Jaguar trainer aircraft crashed during a routine training mission near Bhanuda village in Rajasthan's Churu district on Wednesday afternoon, reports Ashok Singh Shekhawat.The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to determine the cause of the crash - the third such accident involving the twin-engine bomber since March.The twin-seater aircraft, which took off from Suratgarh airbase near Sriganganagar, went down around 12.40pm with a loud explosion, sparking fear and panic among local residents.In a post on X, the IAF confirmed that both pilots - whose identities have not been made public so far - sustained fatal injuries in the accident. The IAF remains the only air force where the jet is still in service.A lthough IAF did not name the deceased pilots, Rajasthan cabinet minister Rajyavardhan Rathore condoled on X the deaths of Squadron Leader Lokender Singh Sindhu and Flight Lieutenant Rishi Raj Singh. The wreckage of the fighter jet was scattered across an agricultural field, with no reported damage to civilian property. The area was later cordoned off by security forces.Churu SP Jai Yadav stated that efforts were underway to collect the scattered debris. As per database of Aviation Safety network, at least 12 Jaguars have crashed in the last decade. Yet, the vintage jet developed in 1960s and inducted into IAF in 1979 is expected to remain in service till around 2040. Emergency response teams, fire services and ambulances quickly reached the scene.IAF officers were airlifted to the crash site and a military investigation team began to collect the debris. Rajaldesar SHO Kamlesh confirmed the discovery of human remains near crash site. District officials were overseeing the situation at crash site. Rajasthan governor Haribhau Bagde, CM Bhajan Lal Sharma and former CM Ashok Gehlot expressed condolences over the tragic deaths. In April, a Jaguar trainer aircraft had crashed in Gujarat’s Jamnagar, killing one of the two pilots. On March 7, a Jaguar on a routine sortie had crashed in Ambala due to a technical snag, but the pilot had managed to eject safely.","IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to determine the cause of the crash. The twin-seater aircraft, which took off from Suratgarh airbase near Sriganganagar, went down around 12.40pm with a loud explosion. The wreckage of the fighter jet was scattered across an agricultural field.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122350811,imgsize-1922254,width-400,resizemode-4/122350811.jpg"
"13 die as Gujarat bridge collapses, 6 vehicles fall into Mahi river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/13-die-as-gujarat-bridge-collapses-6-vehicles-fall-into-mahi-river/articleshow/122350359.cms,"Around 7.30 am, a large slab of the 43-year-old bridge over the Mahisagar River gave way. The bridge connected Vadodara and Anand districts, serving as a vital link between Central Gujarat and Saurashtra

VADODARA: At least 13 people, including two children, died Wednesday morning when six vehicles plunged 50 to 60 feet into Mahi river after a key section of a 39-year-old bridge caved in near Mujpur village, 27km from Vadodara.The collapse reignited memories of the Morbi tragedy in Oct 2022, when a 19th-century suspension bridge gave way after renovation, killing 135 and injuring 56. Investigations blamed shoddy repairs and rushed timelines.Built in 1986, the bridge near Mujpur links central Gujarat to Saurashtra and is heavily used by trucks and tankers from industrial zones in Padra and Ankleshwar. Many commuters favour it to avoid tolls on Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway.A 15- to 20-metre segment of the 830m-long bridge gave way around 7.30am, sending three trucks, a pick-up van, an auto-rickshaw, and a seven-seater vehicle crashing into the water below. A large tanker truck teetered dangerously at the edge before being pulled to safety.Residents of nearby Dabka and Mujpur villages, jolted awake by the sound of collapsing concrete and cries for help, mounted rescue efforts for nearly an hour before teams from Vadodara fire brigade and NDRF arrived.By late evening, 13 bodies had been pulled from the river. The victims were from Vadodara, Anand, and Panchmahal districts. Five injured survivors are being treated at SSG Hospital in Vadodara.""I was on my way to Anand. The truck suddenly began shaking violently. Before I could grasp what was happening, the bridge collapsed and I plunged into the river,"" said driver Ganpat Solanki, who survived the fall.Vadodara district panchayat member Harshadsinh Parmar had flagged concerns about the Gambhira bridge's condition to state govt in Aug 2022, prompting inspections. Funds were sanctioned recently, with a new Rs 212-crore bridge project in the pipeline.President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, and CM Bhupendra Patel expressed condolences. Gujarat govt announced Rs 4 lakh in compensation for families of the deceased, while Centre pledged Rs 2 lakh from PM's National Relief Fund. The injured will receive Rs 50,000 from both state and Centre.Wednesday's tragedy added to growing calls for mandatory structural audits, stricter bridge maintenance, and accountability for years of neglected infrastructure.A 30-year-old iron footbridge over Indrayani river near Kundamala in Pune collapsed on June 15, killing four and injuring over 50. Age, overcrowding, and ignored safety warnings were cited as reasons.","A 15- to 20-metre segment of the 830m-long bridge gave way around 7.30am, sending three trucks, a pick-up van, an auto-rickshaw, and a seven-seater vehicle crashing into the water below.

"Dow Chemical's plea nixed, gas tragedy probe stays with Bhopal court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dow-plea-nixed-gas-tragedy-probe-stays-with-bhopal-court/articleshow/122350087.cms,"Representative image

BHOPAL: A Bhopal court will continue to hear the criminal case linked to the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, rejecting Dow Chemical's plea to shift proceedings to a CBI court in Indore. Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Hemlata Ahirwar ruled Wednesday that her court holds jurisdiction, fixing the next hearing for Aug 23.Dow Chemical, which took over Union Carbide Corporation in 2000, had earlier been declared a proclaimed offender after failing to respond to six court summonses. It responded only after seventh notice was served to its US headquarters. Dow's counsel - senior advocates Siddartha Luthra and Ravindra Shrivastava - said Indian courts, including JMFC Bhopal, lack jurisdiction over a US-based company and only CBI court in Indore is competent to hear the case. The argument marked a shift in Dow's earlier stand that no Indian court could conduct proceedings against it.CBI's counsel Manphool Vishnoi and lawyers for NGO Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA) - Avi Singh and Prasanna B - opposed the jurisdictional challenge. They said the disaster happened in Bhopal and the case falls squarely within its courts' authority, regardless of CBI's role as prosecuting agency.The court will now examine three key issues: Dow Chemical's claim that no legal action can be initiated against it in India; the company's accountability for the Bhopal disaster after its acquisition of UCC; and BGIA's 2024 application seeking Dow's business integration plan during the UCC takeover. BGIA had earlier urged the CJM court to formally make Dow a party in the case.","Dow Chemical took over Union Carbide Corporation in 2000.

ED searches farm neta among 'donkey route' agents in illegal immigration case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-farm-neta-among-donkey-route-agents-in-illegal-immigration-case/articleshow/122349977.cms,"ED

BATHINDA/NEW DELHI: In a massive crackdown on illegal immigration rackets operating from several cities in Punjab and Haryana, the Enforcement Director on Wednesday conducted searches at 11 locations in seven cities on some of these agents, including on the premises of farmers' union leader Sukhwinder Singh , also known as Sukh Gill, the president of BKU (Totewal) faction, for their involvement in sending unsuspecting people through the 'donkey route' to the US.ED officials spent several hours inside Gill's house at Tota Singh Wala village in Moga district, around 80 km from Ludhiana, and went through various documents, sources said.Gill, who was not at home when the ED team arrived, said he had nothing to hide and that some people were conspiring against him. He said the human trafficking complaint against him was false and he was open to being investigated by any agency.ED searches were carried out in Amritsar, Sangrur, Patiala, Moga, Ambala, Kurukshetra and Karnal on agents who were found charging Rs 40-50 lakh each from victims, promising to send them to the US through legal channels. At least 400 such people were deported, handcuffed and chained, by the US in military aircraft since Feb.Soon after their arrival in India, the ED began its probe and recorded statements of the victims of 'immigration fraud'. Questioning revealed the names of agents who were behind this racket, a senior official said. The ED's money laundering investigation is based on 17 FIRs registered by police in Punjab and Haryana against some of these travel agents and middlemen offering to arrange 'visas' by the American embassy.""During investigation, it was gathered that the agents used to target people who wanted to immigrate to the US. Promising them migration through legal channels and through flights, the agents charged them huge amounts (around Rs 45-50 lakh per candidate),"" a source said.However, the agents later forced them to take the donkey route (illegal channel) by crossing the land borders of many countries, sometimes illegally through dangerous forests ""under the influence of mafias"".These agents, in collusion with mafias at border crossings, created threatening situations for illegal migrants and their families during their journey, and were forced to pay more money, besides the Rs 40-50 lakh charged at the beginning. The revelations were made by some of the deportees when they were interrogated by the ED.","Sukh Gill, president of BKU (Totewal) faction, said he had nothing to hide.

JAMMU: A Pahalgam-bound vehicle part of the Amarnath Yatra convoy hit a divider in Udhampur’s Chenani area early Wednesday, leaving the driver injured, even as four passengers escaped unscathed.Preliminary probe suggested the driver may have dozed off at the wheel, leading to the accident around 6.17am. “The injured driver, Shashikant, is a resident of Haryana’s Karnal. He was admitted to Udhampur GMCH with a head injury,” said an official.Meanwhile, the eighth batch of Amarnath yatris — comprising 7,579 pilgrims — set out early Wednesday from Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the holy cave shrine nestled in the Himalayas.

What is Blue alert?







Blue alert has been issued in Texas as authorities continue their search for a 12th suspect in what officials describe as a July 4 “ambush” at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Fox4 reported.Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.The suspect, a former US Marine Corps Reservist of five years, allegedly used two AR-15-style rifles to fire at three officers during the ambush.Moreover, the FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song's arrest.A Blue alert is a public safety notification system used to help locate and apprehend suspects who have seriously injured or killed a law enforcement officer. Much like Amber or Silver alerts, it leverages broadcast and digital platforms to quickly inform the public and encourage tips that may lead to an arrest.To issue a Blue alert, specific conditions must be met: a law enforcement officer must have been killed or critically injured; the suspect must pose a serious threat to the public or other officers; and there must be identifying information such as a vehicle description or license plate that can be shared widely.Additionally, the investigating agency must recommend activation to the Texas department of public safety.Currently, Texas is one of 34 US states that operate a Blue alert system, using it as a tool to engage the public in high-priority manhunts where officer safety and community risk are at stake.","Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.

.





US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday (local time) that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will now serve as the interim administrator of Nasa In a post on Truth Social, Trump praised Duffy’s work in transportation, saying he is improving air traffic control systems and rebuilding roads and bridges.“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country’s Transportation Affairs, including creating state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient and beautiful again. He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time. Congratulations, and thank you, Sean,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Soon after, Duffy responded by thanking President Trump and accepting the role.“Honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let’s launch,” Duffy wrote on X.This change comes after Trump withdrew his earlier choice, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, at the end of May. Isaacman had been set for a Senate vote to confirm him as Nasa chief, but Trump canceled the nomination, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”Isaacman is known for his private space missions and is close friends with SpaceX CEO and billionaire Elon Musk . Trump said it would be “inappropriate” for someone so close to Musk to lead Nasa, given how much Nasa works with SpaceX.“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head Nasa. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” the president said at the time.Musk, who was once a close Trump ally and had led the Department of Government Efficiency, has recently fallen out with Trump over disagreements about the president’s broader policy agenda.Musk and Duffy reportedly clashed at a March cabinet meeting, when the Transportation Secretary accused the tech billionaire of trying to fire air traffic controllers, CNN quoted.Duffy is not the only member of the president’s Cabinet taking on additional roles outside of their traditional duties. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is currently also serving as interim national security adviser and national archivist.","US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will now serve as the interim administrator of Nasa.

'Nefarious mechanism': Republicans issue stern warning to US universities against Chinese scholarship program; call it security threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nefarious-mechanism-republicans-issue-stern-warning-to-us-universities-against-chinese-scholarship-program-call-it-security-threat/articleshow/122354192.cms,"AP image





House Republicans have asked seven US universities to cut ties with a Chinese scholarship program that lawmakers cite as “nefarious mechanism” which aims to steal technology for the Chinese government.The lawmakers sent letters on Tuesday to Dartmouth College, the University of Notre Dame and five other schools, warning them about their partnerships with the China Scholarship Council (CSC). The CSC is a study-abroad program funded by the Chinese government that pays for hundreds of Chinese graduate students to study at US universities every year. After graduation, these students are required to return to China for two years.Republican Representative John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, called the program a threat to US national security. He wrote that the CSC claims to be an academic partnership but it actually uses American universities to support China’s military and scientific growth.Some universities say they are already leaving the program. Dartmouth said it has had fewer than 10 students in the program over the past 10 years and had already decided to end it.Notre Dame said it began ending its involvement earlier this year. The University of Tennessee confirmed it received the letter and is reviewing it.The House committee is now reviewing how the program operates at US universities. Lawmakers have demanded for documents related to the program from all seven institutions.According to the letters, these partnerships have brought up to 15 Chinese graduate students a year to Dartmouth and about 40 to Notre Dame.House Republicans, including US President Donald Trump , have been paying closer attention to Chinese students in the US. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would cancel visas for some Chinese students studying in critical field. During his first term, Trump restricted visas for students linked to China’s “military-civil fusion” strategy.Many US universities agree on the need to protect research but warn against treating all Chinese scholars with suspicion. They note that only a small number have ever been involved in spying.China is the second-largest source of foreign students in the US, after India. In the 2023–24 academic year, more than 270,000 Chinese students studied in the US, making up about a quarter of all international students. Most pay their own way, and many stay to work in the US, while others return to China after graduation.Representative Moolenaar has focused on cutting ties between US and Chinese universities. In May, he pressured Duke University to end a partnership he said allowed access to federally funded research. In June, Eastern Michigan University ended ties with two Chinese universities after pressure from the committee.Last year, House Republicans released a report claiming that hundreds of millions of dollars in US government research funding had ended up helping China advance in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and nuclear weapons. The report called China’s academic partnerships “Trojan horses” for stealing technology and said China was taking advantage of academic cooperation in a secretive and harmful way.","House Republicans have asked seven US universities to cut ties with a Chinese scholarship program.

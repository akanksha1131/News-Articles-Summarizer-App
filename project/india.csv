EC set to order pan-India SIR before the year is out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-set-to-order-pan-india-sir-before-the-year-is-out/articleshow/123821539.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a precursor to ordering a pan-india special revision of electoral roll (SIR), EC on Wednesday met the chief electoral officers (CEOs) of all states and UTs to assess their preparedness in terms of records of the last intensive revision and the status of current voter's list, besides hearing their suggestions on the state/UT-specific documents that may be accepted to prove one's eligibility for inclusion in the roll.EC is likely to order a pan-India SIR soon, possibly later this month or early next month. The SIR will be in lieu of the annual special summary revision (SSR) with Jan 1, 2026 as the reference date.As in the case of Bihar, EC will take electors included in the roll published at the last intensive revision in a particular state/UT, as presumed citizens. At the CEOs meeting Wednesday - inaugurated by CEC Gyanesh Kumar along with election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi - EC heard the CEOs on the total number of electors, qualifying date of last intensive revision and status of roll based on the last SIR undertaken in their state/UT. All the states/UTs confirmed having the records and digitised rolls from the last intensive revision, and updated the poll panel on the status of mapping of current electors with those in the voter's list based on the previous intensive revision.""The states/UT CEOs have already been matching the electors who figure in the roll from last intensive revision, with the current roll. This will save time in pre-enumeration activities.The enumeration forms of nearly 50-60% of electors present in both rolls will only need to be signed and not require any documentation,"" an EC officer told TOI.The state/UT CEOs indicated the additional documents that may help establish a person's citizenship status. ""Some states/UTs issue documents unique to them. EC will take a call on whether to expand or tweak the existing list of documents on a pan-India basis or have a different set of accepted documents for each state/UT,"" said an officer. With the purpose of SIR being that no eligible citizen is left out of the roll and no ineligible person included, there was consensus that documents sought should ""promote ease of submission for eligible citizens"".While CEOs of states like West Bengal cited the upcoming festivals and holidays to demand a longer timeframe for SIR, EC is likely to take a pan-India view in this regard, rather than give standalone concessions to any state.Meanwhile, EC informed Calcutta HC Wednesday that preparations for a SIR of rolls in WB have begun and formal guidelines will be issued soon.","EC is likely to order a pan-India SIR soon, possibly later this month or early next month.

"Since 1970, governors cleared 94% of over 17k bills, withheld assent to only 20: Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/since-1970-governors-cleared-94-of-over-17k-bills-withheld-assent-to-only-20-centre/articleshow/123821470.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday defended the constitutional scheme conferring discretion on governors on bills, and said for the last 55 years it has worked smoothly with the heads of states assenting to 94% of over 17,000 bills presented to them and withholding assent only to 20 bills.Presenting statistics on bills presented to governors since 1970 and the decisions taken on them, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that in 84% of the bills, the governors had granted assent within one month of receiving the bills, which indicates that the constitutional scheme has worked irrespective of the political parties governing at the Centre and the states.It is only a few states who have decided to rush to Supreme Court in the last few years to attempt solutions through judicial adjudication, rather than resorting to the tried and tested political mechanism which for more than five decades had been able to resolve the differences between the state govts and the governors.He said of the 17,150 bills presented to governors between 1970 and 2025, 16,122 were assented to, of which 14,402 bills (84%) received governors' assent within a month of the heads of the states receiving them.The statistics indicated the trend to be true even for TN, where an overwhelming majority of the bills received assent from governor within a month.Presentation of the data by the SG invited protests from senior advocates Kapil Sibal (for Bengal) and A M Singhvi (for TN), who said the court did not allow them to present statistics about inordinate delays on part of governors to take a decision on the bills, some extending to years. The bench agreed and stopped SG from relying on the statistics.CJI Gavai said, ""We didn't allow them to rely on statistics about delay on bills caused by individual governors. We will only answer the questions referred to us by the President based on interpretation of the constitutional provisions.""Mehta said individual aberrations by governors in delaying decisions on bills cannot be a reason for the court to enter the forbidden territory on amendment of constitutional provisions, which fall within the exclusive domain of Parliament.Appearing for DMK, senior advocate P Wilson said TN has suffered the most because of the unconstitutional delay resulting from the inaction of the ornamental head of state in the governor. He said, ""A bill born in assembly cannot be killed in Raj Bhawan.""","The Centre on Wednesday defended the constitutional scheme conferring discretion on governors on bills.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks.""""I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he added.The remarks come after Trump had earlier softened his tone on India-US relations, calling the ties ""very special,"" affirming his friendship with PM Modi on Friday.Earlier, speaking at the White House Trump had said that, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship.There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""However, Trump's Trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday renewed his attack on India and warned that it ""won't end well"" if New Delhi doesn't ""come around"" at some point in trade negotiations with the United States.In his interview with 'Real America Voice', Navarro reiterated that India is ""Maharaja"" of tariffs.""But it's absolutely true. They have the highest tariffs in any major country in the world against the United States. We got to deal with that,"" Navarro said.""I think India must come around at some point.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament

Poll Do you think young leaders like Balen Shah can bring positive change in Nepal? Yes, he can make a difference No, experience matters more

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balendra Shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022.

"Canada rejects 80% of Indian student visas in 2025, Germany rises as top destination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/canada-rejects-80-of-indian-student-visas-in-2025-germany-rises-as-top-destination/articleshow/123793052.cms,"The forces behind Canada’s tightened visa regime



Ripple effects on students and institutions



Germany emerges as the new epicenter



A global rebalancing in international education

In 2025, Canada, long heralded as a haven for international students, enacted one of the most restrictive visa regimes in a decade. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) data reveals that nearly 80% of Indian student applications were rejected, a staggering surge in denials that has reshaped global student mobility. Applicants from Asia and Africa have also felt the brunt, signaling a regional recalibration in international education flows.For decades, North America was a near-automatic first choice for ambitious students seeking global exposure, with Canada’s reputation for safety, opportunity, and high-quality education drawing tens of thousands annually. Yet, recent figures underscore a profound transformation: In 2024, only 1.88 lakh Indian students gained admission, barely half of what was recorded just two years prior, according to official data from the Canadian government. The shift in preference is stark; Germany now leads as the most sought-after destination for Indian students at 31%, while Canada’s share plummeted from 18% in 2022 to 9% in 2024.The decision is not arbitrary but rooted in domestic imperatives. Ottawa faces mounting pressures: housing shortages, strained infrastructure, and growing political demands to prioritize local talent. In response, Canada has fortified visa scrutiny.Applicants must now demonstrate substantial financial resources, furnish comprehensive study plans, and meet stricter language requirements.Financial prerequisites have doubled to over CA$20,000, and work regulations for students have become more restrictive. Graduate language requirements are more rigorous, while certain post-graduation employment avenues have been curtailed. Even the Student Direct Stream, a mechanism designed to expedite approvals, has been shuttered. Overall, the government plans to issue 437,000 study permits in 2025, representing a near 10% reduction from the previous year. Of these, 73,000 will be allocated for postgraduate students, 243,000 for undergraduates and others, and roughly 120,000 for renewals and school-level students, as suggested by media reports.For aspirants, the surge in rejections extends beyond procedural hurdles. Families invest heavily in applications, language tests, and preparatory courses, only to confront dashed aspirations. Many viewed the Canadian study as a pathway to permanent residence, a prospect now clouded in uncertainty.Universities, particularly smaller colleges reliant on international tuition, are confronting financial strain. Some face existential threats, with mergers or closures looming as revenue streams shrink. The tightening of North American corridors has accelerated a global recalibration, pushing students to reconsider alternative destinations.As Canada contracts, Germany is experiencing a remarkable surge in international enrolments. Its robust economy, publicly funded universities, and expanding English-language programmes make it increasingly attractive to Indian students. According to Federal Statistical Office of Germany enrollment figures underscore this rise: Indian student numbers have more than doubled over the past five years, reaching nearly 60,000 in 2025, up from 49,500 in 2023.Fields such as technology, management, and engineering have become particularly enticing in Germany due to cost-effective education and lower living expenses compared to North America. Policies supporting clearer career pathways and enhanced retention opportunities further cement its appeal. Other emerging hubs include France, Finland, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and the Middle East.This phenomenon signals not merely closed doors but a seismic shift in demand. Indian students increasingly prioritize destinations that combine affordability, quality, and career sustainability. Traditional leaders like the US, UK, and Canada are confronting local constraints that erode their competitive edge, while alternative markets gain traction.The trend illustrates a more nuanced landscape: International education is no longer dominated by historical prestige alone. Students are agile, strategically weighing cost, opportunity, and long-term employability. For policymakers and institutions, the challenge is clear—adaptation is imperative, or risk ceding ground to rising global competitors.","In 2025, Canada enacted one of the most restrictive visa regimes in a decade.

Poll Do you think the protests will lead to positive change in Nepal? Yes, they could bring positive change No, it will only cause more problems

Fear of crimes, further instability stalks Nepal







Less than 24 hours after police gunfire left 19 people dead outside its parliament, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli resigned Tuesday as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the Himalayan nation has seen in years. The Nepal army declared that it would assume responsibility for law and order from 10pm.By Tuesday afternoon, protesters stormed the federal parliament building inside the Singha Durbar complex, shattering windows and setting fires in multiple chambers. Flames rose as young demonstrators danced and chanted. ""This building never worked for us,"" said Mira Thapa, a 20-year-old student waving a Nepali flag. ""Burning it down means we can build something new.""The fury spread to the homes of senior politicians. Foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba, wife of former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, was dragged from her residence and beaten by a mob. ""They kept shouting that we had stolen their future,"" she later told aides. Deuba was also assaulted. Deputy PM and finance minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel was chased through the streets by protesters who kicked and struck him. Former PM Jhalanath Khanal's wife, Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, was killed after protesters torched their home.Party officials confirmed her death late Tuesday, calling it a barbaric act that reflected the dangerous turn of the movement.Officials at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu confirmed by evening that the toll had risen to 22, with more than 300 injured in clashes and stampedes across the city.In a statement, the army warned that ""taking undue advantage of the adverse situation, some groups have been causing excessive damage to ordinary citizens and public property, as well as engaging in looting and arson. To prevent such activities, the army, along with all other security agencies, will assume primary responsibility of maintaining law and order for safety of Nepal and Nepalis.""The bloodshed came three days after govt abruptly revoked a blanket ban on 26 social media platforms, a measure that had triggered the Gen Z-led protests. The ban, introduced days earlier under Oli's administration, was reversed after a night of emergency cabinet meetings, ministerial resignations and mounting international pressure. Home minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned ""on moral grounds,"" acknowledging that the move had left nearly 20 dead. ""I cannot continue in office when young people are dying in the streets because of a wrong decision,"" he told colleagues.Oli, by contrast, insisted he had never supported the ban. ""I was not in favour of blocking social media,"" he told reporters. Even as the cabinet scrambled to retreat, the clampdown on the streets deepened. Police acknowledged using rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters outside parliament, while the home ministry confirmed that the army had been placed on standby. Curfews were extended across Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and flights at Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital Kathmandu were suspended.Symbolic targets were also attacked. Protesters stormed and set fire to the Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu. The luxury property, which opened only last year and is linked to political patrons, was one of the most high-profile casualties of the unrest. Elsewhere, crowds torched the headquarters of governing and opposition parties, vandalised the Kantipur Media Group building, and set sections of Supreme Court compound on fire. For many protesters, such attacks were deliberate acts ""against symbols of privilege and impunity"".Chaos also engulfed Nepal's prisons. In Mahottari district, protesters and inmates breached the walls of Jaleshwar Jail, freeing more than 500 prisoners. In Lalitpur, the Nakhu jail was set ablaze and emptied, with opposition figure Rabi Lamichhane among those released. Police said he was handed over to his family after crowds massed outside demanding his safety. ""The prison could no longer guarantee security,"" one officer said. ""When the fire started, the priority was survival."" Officials admitted they had lost control of multiple facilities, raising fears of a surge in crime and further instability.Helicopters evacuated ministers from their homes in Bhaisepati as smoke rose over govt quarters.","Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli resigns as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the Himalayan nation has seen in years.

A video of a US man went viral after he claimed that ""every worker"" he encountered at London’s Heathrow Airport was Indian, questioning why he did not see any British staff.""I just landed in London. I'm at the airport. And I keep walking around the centre of the airport, where the restaurants are and everything. I don't see any British people working. Not one. Every single one of them is Indian.

However, he questioned how Britain, a country he associated with freedom and democracy, could have no British employees in that setting.""Especially because I'm an immigrant myself. If I walk around the United States, I want to see Americans. I don't want every person that I see and works to be somebody else,"" he added.The clip quickly drew strong reactions online.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats.

Cross-voting in VP election? Radhakrishnan's victory margin puts question mark on opposition's unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cross-voting-in-vp-election-radhakrishnans-victory-margin-puts-question-mark-on-oppositions-unity/articleshow/123769754.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice-President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300. Announcing the result, Rajya Sabha Secretary General and Returning Officer P C Mody said 767 MPs had cast their votes out of the total valid electors of 781. He said 752 ballots were valid and 15 were invalid, bringing down the required majority of first preference votes to 377.That Radhakrishnan would win the VP race was perhaps never in doubt given the numbers advantage that he had over Reddy. But there was still a lot of interest in the final results. The fact that VP polls are held without any party whip thereby leaving a window open for cross voting had instilled some hope in the opposition camp. If not an outright win, they could at least bank on ""conscience vote"" to attract some NDA MPs to their side and embarrass the ruling camp. The Telugu card was a thought out strategy to achieve this objective.Unfortunately, as the final results show, the strategy boomeranged.Instead of NDA MPs ditching their camp, it appears the INDIA bloc members responded to their ""conscience"". The vote tally suggests some cross-voting in favour of Radhakrishnan.The BJP, which had silently ensured that all leaders associated with the ruling alliance voted in favour of NDA candidate, was quick to take digs at opposition's pre-voting claims of unity within their ranks.Union minister Kiren Rijiju claimed ""Many opposition parties have also voted for our NDA candidate. This is also a very good sign."" In fact, BJP claims that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh had earlier asserted that all 315 INDIA bloc MPs were in attendance for the vote.""The Opposition has stood united. ALL of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout,"" he said on X.Since this was a secret ballot, so who all cast conscience vote may perhaps be not known. But the opposition did admit that it suffered a dent, though not a significant one.""There has been a 14% increase in votes secured by this candidate (Opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy) as compared to the last candidate. This candidate received 40% of the total votes, compared to 26% secured by the previous candidate. So the Opposition is only gaining; there will be a change...They (NDA) could not cause a significant dent ... ,"" Congress MP Imran Masood said.However, with Reddy managing only 300, the deficit of 15 votes raised questions. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to take pot shots at this claim. Soon after the results were out, he responded to Jairam's post and wrote:""All 315 voted… but for whom is the real question! 🤔 Despite all the noise and bravado, the INDI Alliance candidate managed only 300 votes, 15 short of what they had confidently claimed. So much for tall claims and unity!""However, Jairam Ramesh put up a brave defence and claimed opposition performance had improved compared to last elections.""Opposition performance has undeniably been most respectable. Its joint candidate Justice (retd) B Sudershan Reddy secured 40% of the vote. In 2022, the Opposition had received 26% of the vote in the vice presidential elections,"" Ramesh said.""The BJP's arithmetical victory is really both a moral and political defeat. The ideological battle continues undiminished,"" the Congress leader added.These claims notwithstanding, the fact remains that the opposition once again put up a poor show. Yes, 15 votes were declared invalid. But this does not explain the dip in INDIA bloc's overall numbers. Moreover, there is still no clarity on how the AAP members, who had promised support to Reddy, have voted.So, while the results are not a surprise, the more than expected victory margin of C P Radhakrishnan is surely is a matter of concern for the opposition. Clearly, they still are far away from their claims of unity.(With inputs from agencies)",NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice- President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300.

'One Who Fools People The Best Can Be The Best Leader': Nitin Gadkari's Leadership 'Truth' Shocker

NEW DELHI: Days after the Supreme Court rejected a PIL challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended (E20) petrol, road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday blamed the “petrol lobby” and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending.""Everywhere there are lobbies, there are interests... petrol lobby is very rich,"" he said when asked about the spate of social media posts where consumers could be seen complaining about the reduction of mileage and damage to the engines of older vehicles due to the E20 fuel.Speaking at the Auto Retail Conclave organized by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Gadkari said that ethanol—produced from sugarcane, broken rice, and other agricultural products—is expected to help reduce India's dependence on foreign oil.The country is spending Rs 22 lakh crore for importing fossil fuels, which are also leading to ""problems of pollution"" across cities, the minister added.He said companies are manufacturing electric cars, buses, and trucks in India as they are very cost-effective. ""The cost of lithium-ion batteries is also reducing. In due course of time, the price of petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles will be the same.""The minister also said the manufacturing capacity of electric buses in India is 50,000-60,000 units per year, against a requirement for nearly one lakh units annually.""We need to increase the production of electric buses... There is a huge market for exports also. This is the opportunity for electric vehicle companies.""The minister also said the transport ministry is working to encourage the use of flex-fuel engines in agricultural equipment vehicles.On the growth potential of the passenger vehicle market, he said the government aims to make the Indian market the top seller in the world within five years.""Within five years, our target is to make India's automobile industry number 1 in the world... it is difficult, but not impossible,"" he said, adding that the quality of vehicles manufactured in India is good while production costs are low compared to other countries.""When I took charge as transport minister, the size of the Indian automobile industry was Rs 14 lakh crore. The size now is Rs 22 lakh crore,"" Gadkari said, adding that at Rs 78 lakh crore, the US is the biggest market globally, followed by China (Rs 47 lakh crore).","Road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari blamed the “petrol lobby’ and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending.

"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"Poll Should the Supreme Court have the authority to influence changes to laws regarding brain-death definitions? Yes, they should have that authority. No, it violates separation of powers.

NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.

Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered most transformative period in RSS' 100-year journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-jis-tenure-will-be-considered-most-transformative-period-in-rss-100-yr-journey/articleshow/123820021.cms,"RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

(The author is Prime Minister of India)

Today is Sept 11. This day evokes two contrasting remembrances. The first dates back to 1893, when Swami Vivekananda delivered his iconic Chicago address. With the few words, ""Sisters and Brothers of America,"" he won the hearts of thousands present in the hall. He introduced the timeless spiritual heritage of India and the emphasis on universal brotherhood to the world stage. The second is the gruesome 9/11 attacks, when this very principle came under attack thanks to the menace of terrorism and radicalism.There is something else about this day which is noteworthy. Today is the birthday of a personality who, inspired by the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, has dedicated his entire life to societal transformation and strengthening the spirit of harmony and fraternity. For lakhs of people associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he is respectfully referred to as Param Pujya Sarsanghchalak. Yes, I am referring to Shri Mohan Bhagwat ji, whose 75th birthday is, incidentally, falling in the same year when the RSS marks its centenary. I would like to convey my best wishes to him and pray for his long and healthy life.My association with Mohan ji's family has been very deep. I have had the good fortune of working closely with Mohan ji's father, the late Madhukarrao Bhagwat ji. I have written extensively about him in my book, Jyotipunj. Along with his association with the legal world, he devoted himself to nation-building. He played a pivotal role in strengthening the RSS across Gujarat. Such was Madhukarrao ji's passion towards nation-building that it groomed his son, Mohanrao, to work towards India's regeneration.It is as if Parasmani Madhukarrao prepared another Parasmani in Mohanrao.Mohan ji became a pracharak in the mid-1970s. Upon hearing the word 'pracharak', one may mistakenly think it refers to someone who is simply doing prachar or campaigning, propagating ideas. But, those familiar with the working of the RSS understand that the pracharak tradition is at the core of the organisation's work. Over the last hundred years, thousands of young people, inspired by a patriotic zeal, have left their homes and families to dedicate their lives to realising the mission of India First.His early years in the RSS coincided with a very dark period of Indian history. This was the time the draconian Emergency was imposed by the then Congress govt. For every person who cherished democratic principles and wanted India to prosper, it was natural to strengthen the anti-Emergency movement. This is exactly what Mohan ji and countless RSS swayamsevaks did. He worked extensively in rural and backward areas of Maharashtra, especially Vidarbha. This shaped his understanding of the challenges faced by the poor and downtrodden.Over the years, Bhagwat ji held various positions in the RSS. He performed each and every one of those duties with great dexterity. Mohan ji's years as the head of the Akhil Bharatiya Sharirik Pramukh during the 1990s are still fondly remembered by many swayamsevaks. During this period, he spent considerable time working in the villages of Bihar. These experiences further deepened his connect with grassroots issues. In 2000, he became the sarkaryawah and here too, he brought his unique way of working, handling the most complex of situations with ease and precision. In 2009, he became the sarsanghchalak and continues to work with great vibrancy.Being sarsanghchalak is more than an organisational responsibility. Extraordinary individuals have defined this role through personal sacrifice, clarity of purpose and unshakable commitment to Maa Bharti. Mohan ji, in addition to doing full justice to the enormity of the responsibility, has also brought to it his own strength, intellectual depth and empathetic leadership, all of which is inspired by the principle of Nation First.If I can think of two attributes Mohan ji has held close to his heart and imbibed in his work style, they are continuity and adaptation. He has always steered the Organisation through very complex currents, never compromising on the core ideology we are all proud of and at the same time addressing the evolving needs of society. He has a natural connect with the youth and thus, has always focused on integrating more youngsters with the Sangh Parivar. He is often seen engaging in public discourse and interacting with people, which has been very beneficial in today's dynamic and digital world.Broadly speaking, Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered the most transformative period in the 100-year journey of the RSS. From the change in uniform to the modifications in the shiksha vargs (training camps), several significant changes occurred under his leadership.I particularly remember Mohan ji's efforts during the Covid period, when humanity battled a once in a lifetime pandemic. In those times, continuing the traditional RSS activities became challenging. Mohan ji suggested increased usage of technology. In the context of the global challenges, he remained connected with global perspectives while developing institutional frameworks.At that time, all swayamsevaks made every possible effort to reach out to those in need, while ensuring the safety of themselves and others. Medical camps were organised in several places. We also lost many of our hardworking swayamsevaks, but such was the inspiration of Mohan ji that their determination never wavered.Earlier this year, during the inauguration of the Madhav Netra Chikitsalaya in Nagpur, I had remarked that the RSS is like an Akshayavat, an eternal banyan tree that energises the national culture and collective consciousness of our nation.The roots of this Akshayavat are deep and strong because they are anchored in values. The dedication with which Mohan Bhagwat ji has committed himself to nurturing and advancing these values is truly inspirational.Another admirable quality of Mohan ji's personality is his soft-spoken nature. He is blessed with an exceptional ability to listen. This trait ensures a deeper perspective and also brings a sense of sensitivity and dignity to his persona and leadership.Here, I also want to write about the keen interest he has always shown towards various mass movements. From Swachh Bharat Mission to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, he always urges the entire RSS family to add vigour through these movements. In order to further social well-being, Mohan ji has given the 'Panch Parivartan', which includes social harmony, family values, environmental awareness, national selfhood and civic duties. These can inspire Indians from all walks of life. Every swayamsevak dreams of seeing a strong and prosperous nation. To realise this dream, what is required is both clear vision and decisive action. Mohan ji embodies both these qualities in abundance.Bhagwat ji has always been a strong votary of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat', a firm believer in India's diversity and the celebration of so many different cultures and traditions that are a part of our land.Beyond his busy schedule, Mohan ji has always found time to pursue passions like music and singing. Few people know that he is very versatile in various Indian musical instruments. His passion for reading can be seen in several of his speeches and interactions.This year, in a few days from now, the RSS turns 100. It is also a pleasant coincidence that this year, Vijaya Dashami , Gandhi Jayanti, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti and the RSS centenary celebrations are on the same day. It will be a historic milestone for lakhs of people associated with the RSS in India and the world. And, we have a very wise and hardworking sarsanghchalak in Mohan ji, steering the organisation in these times. I will conclude by saying that Mohan ji is a living example of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, showing that when we rise above boundaries and consider everyone as our own, it strengthens trust, brotherhood and equality in society. I once again wish Mohan ji a long and healthy life in service of Maa Bharti.","Prime Minister: Mohan Bhagwat has dedicated his entire life to societal transformation.

When the high court queried if the will was registered, Nayyar replied it wasn't but was valid.""It's not registered. Unregistered does not take the nature away. All this crying and weeping that is going on, just six days before the suit, the plaintiffs received Rs 1,900 crore from the trust,"" the counsel contended, citing Karisma's divorce proceedings with Sunjay.""There were litigations after litigation, and it ended in acrimonious divorce proceedings in the Supreme Court.At the age of 50, a man dies.

Governors can't sit over bills indefinitely: Centre in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/governors-cant-sit-over-bills-indefinitely-centre-in-sc/articleshow/123818771.cms,"Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 Documents

NEW DELHI: Centre on Wednesday agreed with opposition-led states that governors cannot sit over a bill indefinitely but argued before the Supreme Court that the Constitution had vested in them the discretion to decide whether to grant or withhold assent to legislation, return it with suggestions to the assembly or reserve it for the President's consideration.Responding to opposition-led states' insistence that a governor, being just an ornamental head, cannot choose any of the options without the aid and advice of the council of ministers, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta said a wrong political canvas has been presented in court to persuade it to transgress Parliament's domain and amend constitutional provisions related to governors' powers to make them rubber stamps at the hands of state govts.While Parliament may amend the Constitution under Article 368 (subject to the basic structure), the judiciary's role is confined to interpretation. If courts were to expand the meaning of a provision beyond its textual or structural limits, it would confer upon the judiciary a power equivalent to Parliament, a result not envisaged by the framers (of the Constitution). Such a course would be contrary to the constitutional scheme,"" Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.After nine days of a riveting constitutional debate on the state-governor spat over bills, the SC's April 8 decision fixing timelines for governors and the President, followed by a Presidential Reference flagging powers of the apex court, Mehta said the Centre agreed with Kerala govt that a governor and a state govt should work collaboratively through consultati-on, with the former acting as a friend, philosopher and guide for the council of ministers.He added that the SC was not the headmaster of polity to address every conceivable issue raised by states which primarily belong to the political arena and which could be resolved through consultation among the PM, CM and ministers with the governor, or the President.This has been the practice in Indian polity because of which democracy has grown stronger and the constitutional provisions, including their interpretations by SC, are followed scrupulously. He said since 1970, governors of states had been presented with 17,150 bills, of which assent was withheld in only 20 bills.He said 933 bills had been reserved for President's consideration by governors, who granted assent to 16,122 (94%) of the bills - 14,402 of the nods coming within a month, 623 within three months, 126 in six months and the rest thereafter.Paying tribute to the framers of the Constitution for giving the governor the right to withhold assent to a bill, something termed by opposition-led states as subversion of the will of the people expressed through legislature, Mehta cited the example of the bill that the Punjab assembly passed in 2004 to terminate its water-sharing agreement with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Should the governor, whom some states term a mere rubber stamp at the hands of the council of ministers, have granted assent to such a bill that would have adversely impacted inter-state, federal and India-Pakistan relations, the SG asked.The governor reserved this bill for consideration of the President, who, in turn, sent a reference seeking SC's opinion on the legality of unilateral annulment of water-sharing agreements, he said, adding that in his view governors in such situations are entitled to withhold assent to protect the constitutional scheme of quasi-federal governance. Arguments will conclude Thursday.",Centre agrees with opposition-led states that governors cannot sit over a bill indefinitely. Centre says Constitution vested in them discretion to decide whether to grant or withhold assent to legislation.

Asked about Malik allegedly using abusive language against public functionaries, Singh said it’s officials who often use abusive language toward the public.Malik, who also heads AAP’s J&K unit, was detained on Monday — a day after he accused Doda deputy commissioner Harvinder Singh of misusing his authority — on charges of disturbing public order, and was subsequently lodged in Kathua district jail. He is the first sitting legislator in J&K to be detained under PSA, which allows a person to be kept in custody without charges or trial for up to two years.CM Omar Abdullah, who has strongly condemned Malik’s detention under what he termed “discredited law”, met the legislator’s father Shams-ud-Din Malik on Tuesday evening.Shams-ud-Din, who had travelled from Doda, said he asked the chief minister to secure his son’s release, and was told by Omar that “the entire J&K is with your son”.NC president Farooq Abdullah and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, too, spoke out on Wednesday, warning that attempts to crush people’s voices could lead to mass eruptions. Farooq said LG Manoj Sinha would be solely responsible if law and order situation worsened in the Chenab Valley of Jammu, which is witnessing massive protests against the action against Malik. Security and law and order in J&K are under the LG’s charge.Mehbooba accused the administration of detaining Malik to divert attention from the controversy over desecration of the national emblem at Hazratbal shrine. Referring to the mass uprisings in India’s neighbouring countries, she warned against stifling dissent and said: “We have seen in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now in Nepal what happens when govts suppress voices. If you silence people, situations can spiral out of hand. ”The situation in Doda district, meanwhile, remained tense, but under control. The administration had imposed prohibitory orders after clashes between protesters and security personnel on Tuesday, and internet services were also snapped in the district. On Wednesday morning, additional forces were deployed to maintain law and order.",Mehraj Malik is the first sitting legislator in J&K to be detained under the Public Safety Act.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.

Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube’s towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube’s short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the “OUT” signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India’s five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball. The left-arm spinner demolished the UAE batting order with sensational figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah set the tone for India’s dominance, removing Kerala-born opener Alishan Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker.Sharafu had top-scored for UAE with 22 off 17 balls, including three fours and a six, before Bumrah’s lethal delivery ended his innings. Once Sharafu departed, the UAE batting line-up collapsed swiftly, with wickets tumbling in quick succession.Chasing a modest target of 58, India cruised to a 9-wicket win, starting their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in emphatic fashion.India will next face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai, a contest already billed as the marquee clash of the group stage.","UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease.

Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk.

Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack.

Saif Ali Khan stabbing: Drama in Mumbai court as lawyers clash to represent accused Shariful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saif-ali-khan-stabbing-high-drama-in-mumbai-court-as-lawyers-clash-to-represent-accused-shariful/articleshow/117383102.cms,"vakalatnama

NEW DELHI: The seriousness of a Bandra courtroom gave way to chaos on Sunday as two lawyers scrambled to represent the man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. The scene unfolded during the remand proceedings of Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad , a 30-year-old Bangladeshi national arrested for the attack. The magistrate, caught in the middle of the unexpected tussle, was forced to mediate, ultimately suggesting that the competing advocates represent the accused as a team, news agency PTI reported.Shehzad has been accused of sneaking into Khan’s upscale Bandra residence in the early hours of January 16. According to police, he climbed to the 12th floor of the Satguru Sharan building using a pipe and entered the actor’s apartment through a bathroom window.Once inside, he was confronted by domestic staff, leading to a scuffle during which Khan was allegedly stabbed multiple times. The 54-year-old actor sustained injuries near his neck and spine and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Khan is said to be in stable condition and recovering well.The clash unfolded moments before the accused could sign the legal document () authorising representation, causing confusion. Another lawyer pushed his way to the accused's box and secured Shehzad's signature on his own, leading to a brief moment of confusion over who would represent the alleged attacker.The accused was arrested after a three-day manhunt. Police tracked him to a labour camp in Thane using CCTV footage and inputs from a labour contractor. Authorities allege that Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national who entered India illegally six months ago, had assumed the alias Vijay Das.While initial investigations suggest theft as the motive, police have not ruled out the possibility of an international conspiracy. Shehzad was remanded to police custody for five days to allow further interrogation.Outside the court, Sherkhane, the lawyer representing the accused denied allegations of Shehzad’s Bangladeshi origin, saying, “The police have no evidence to prove my client is from Bangladesh. He has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. The claim that he entered six months ago is baseless.”The lawyers also criticised procedural lapses in the investigation. “The remand copy lacks any mention of an intent to murder, yet serious charges have been levelled against him. No proper investigation has been conducted,” Sherkhane added. Prajapati echoed these concerns, arguing that no substantial recovery had been made, and no documentation supported claims of Shehzad’s foreign origin.","Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad, 30, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

ePlane company gets DGCA acceptance for type certification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eplane-company-gets-dgca-acceptance-for-type-certification/articleshow/117382263.cms,"Representative photo

CHENNAI: The electric aircraft developed by startup ePlane Company has received acceptance for type certification from Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ). This is the first Indian private company to get accepted under the new rules for electric vertical takeoff and landing ( eVTOL ) aircraft issued last September.The DGCA issued airworthiness criteria for type certification of vertical take off and landing capable aircraft (VCA) and issued specifications for vertiports (terminals) used by them.Prof. Satya Chakravarthy, founder told TOI the company has many firsts, including acceptance for testing eVTOLs in India, testing propellers for the first time in the Indo-Pacific region. The startup aims to complete test flights by the end of 2026. “We will make multiple prototypes and then clock cumulative flying hours to demonstrate compliance,” he said.The company plans to provide air ambulances, cargo planes, chartered flights in tourist sites and air taxis in major metros. “The aircraft is spacious enough to operate an air ambulance with a stretcher that can be wheeled into the aircraft. So there is an air ambulance, charter flights in tourist locations, aerial cargo, in addition to the taxis…We are scoping partners such as hospitals, vertiport builders, charging infrastructure providers as well as charter operators. The company is striking partnerships with real estate players for vertiport building, airports, logistic providers, but these are in very early stages,” he said.The company is currently testing only in India as the global regulatory framework for eVTOLs evolves. “The Indian market is probably a lot more primed for this. Even than the advanced economies mainly because our city infrastructure is actually not that great and higher volumes of traffic,” he said.Prof Chakravarthy is also optimistic on the viability of the business compared to traditional air ambulances, as helicopters have maintenance and fuel costs and thus lower patronage and asset utilisation. ""We are going to climb down a spiral where we will essentially say that it's going to become a lot more affordable within what insurance companies today are willing to cover for,” he said.The IIT-M incubated startup so far raised $20 million and plans to raise up to $30 million. “ The more money would actually mean that we can go to market directly instead of just finishing certification. It depends on how the market appetite grows for this as we are able to show the first prototype flights,” he said.",The electric aircraft developed by startup ePlane Company has received acceptance for type certification from Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

Poll Do You Think Illegal Immigration Impacts the Job Market? No, It Doesn’t Have a Significant Effect Yes, It Creates Unfair Competition for Jobs

MUMBAI: The arrest of illegal Bangladeshi immigrant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir for last week’s attempted robbery and assault on actor Saif Ali Khan at his residence in Bandra has reignited concerns about unauthorised entry and stay in the country.Since Bangladeshis, whether illegal or legal immigrants, are often willing to work for less money than the prevailing rate in the city, they are readily hired as labourers, jewellery artisans, domestic help and other such workers, many times through unverified sources, say the police.Crime branch sources said Bangladeshis entering the country illegally typically do this through regions like Malda, 24 Parganas, Murshidabad, Dineshpur and Chapali Nawabganj. Once here, the illegal immigrants reportedly pay Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000 to obtain fake Aadhaar cards with the help of agents. These documents enable them to settle in any part of the country. Agents assist them in securing jobs for a commission.“There is a vast network operating in India that helps these illegal immigrants settle here,” an officer said. “They are not afraid of cases being registered against them, because it guarantees their prolonged stay. Until the case reaches a judgment, they cannot be deported. Moreover, they secure bail within days and continue living a normal life.”Even with regular deportation drives, the illegals keep growing as many re-enter the country under new identities. Many if them get work as housemaids, cooks, fish sellers, casual labourers, and some even enter the flesh trade.In a recent operation, the police and crime branch arrested 30 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants . Last year 310 Bangladeshi nationals staying illegally were arrested by the police in the city alone. Some of the arrested had even been casting votes in elections for years.CM Devendra Fadnavis recently said illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were seeking birth certificates in the state to obtain voting rights. He called it ‘vote jihad part 2’. “Nearly 100 such cases have been reported in Amravati and Malegaon taluka in Nashik. These people, many aged around 50 years, are obtaining documents illegally,” he said at the state BJP convention in Shirdi.During the Nov assembly poll campaign, Fadnavis had cited instances of a community voting en masse against the BJP in the Lok Sabha election held earlier in 2024, and had termed it ‘vote jihad’.In Dec, he had said that a detention centre would be built in the city to keep illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.Last year the crime branch unit 1 arrested a person, Mohammad Idris Sheikh alias Joshimuddin Bishu Dewan, a Bangladeshi residing in the city since 1994. The arrest took place near Charni Road station. During the investigation, officials discovered a “rate chart” detailing the sums paid by Bangladeshis to agents for illegal entry into the country.There is a large demand for maids in the city for domestic and housekeeping work, and Bangladeshis are willing to fill the gap.“There is scarcity of maids and cooks and local workers demand large sums. In comparison Bangladeshis are ready to work round-the-clock and come cheap,” Chaya Kadam, a city resident, said.","The arrest of illegal Bangladeshi immigrant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir for last week’s attempted robbery and assault on actor Saif Ali Khan has reignited concerns about unauthorised entry and stay in the country.

MUMBAI/THANE: Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, also known as Bijoy Das , 30, worked at Slink & Bardot, a fine dining restaurant and pub in Worli, and Blabbering All Day , a hotel in Thane, as housekeeping staff before allegedly taking a stab at robbing celebrities.Following police inquiries about Shariful on Saturday, the Worli pub dismissed its entire housekeeping staff. It also terminated housekeeping manpower supplier Jitendra Pandey ’s contract on discovering he had allowed Shariful to remain in staff accommodation despite his dismissal in Aug.The general manager of Slink & Bardot said the establishment had sacked Shariful for an alleged theft case .“We used to hire housekeeping staff from a particular manpower agent and it was his duty to check the antecedents. We have since Saturday discontinued his service and will no longer recruit through him,” the general manager said.He said the servers and managers were not recruited through Pandey’s agency, only the housekeeping staff.Due to the staff shortage on Sunday, the Slink & Bardot management recruited an elderly resident from Worli-Koliwada for cleaning duties. “Pandey’s entire staff was sacked on Saturday after police came enquiring for Shariful at the pub. The pub manager, Shantanu Das, asked me to work for a day or two to do housekeeping work on Sunday as the pub will start in the evening. I have no more details about Pandey and the staff,” Manohar Patil said.The general manager of Blabber All Day, a hotel located at The Walk, Hiranandani Estate, in Thane confirmed that the accused Shariful, who called himself Bijoy Das, had worked as a housekeeping staff member at the hotel from Sept 15 to Dec 15. The general manager said the hotel subsequently changed its vendor responsible for providing housekeeping staff, leading to the departure of Shariful.During his tenure, he identified himself as Bijoy Das and there were no complaints against him from colleagues or guests. After Dec 15, when the housekeeping vendor was replaced, he left the hotel and was not seen again.","Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, also known as Bijoy Das, 30, worked at Slink & Bardot, a fine dining restaurant and pub in Worli, and Blabbering All Day, a hotel in Thane.

THANE: The arrest of Shariful Fakir was the result of a joint operation by Mumbai Police and Kasarvadavali police of Thane City. It came after a combing operation near Hiranandani Estate that deployed 150 cops, including several senior officers.The operation began around 9pm on Saturday and concluded with the suspect’s arrest well into the early hours of Sunday.Intelligence units tracked the suspect’s mobile tower location to the creek shore near Waghbil village. The search focused on marshy terrain behind a labour colony near a Metro casting yard, with teams using private and official vehicles to block potential escape routes. “The accused was discovered hiding in extremely challenging conditions, concealed under grass and dried leaves in pitch darkness,” said an officer.The investigation revealed that Shariful chose his hiding spot based on prior knowledge of the area. Multiple teams conducted thorough searches of the labour colony. Security personnel established a cordon while search teams methodically checked every possible hiding spot. Workers at the labour camp were lined up for identification, and their mobile devices were examined for any communication with the suspect.The final phase of the operation unfolded in a narrow lane adjacent to the labour camp, where dense vegetation and mangroves provided numerous potential hiding spots. Local resident Prathamesh Patil, a fisherman whose assistance was sought during the operation, reported: “Police knocked on my door three times throughout the night, showing photographs and seeking information about suspicious movements in the area.”When discovered, the accused was found exhausted, having covered himself with dry leaves. He offered no resistance during the arrest and was immediately transported to Mumbai for detailed interrogation regarding the attack on the actor.A local woman from the labour colony later revealed that the accused was previously involved in an altercation after allegedly misbehaving with her. Other workers confirmed seeing him occasionally at the camp, while security guards reported observing flashlights.","The arrest of Shariful Fakir was the result of a joint operation by Mumbai Police and Kasarvadavali police of Thane City.

PRAYAGRAJ: Engineer Abhey Singh , popularly known online as "" IITian Baba ,"" was expelled from Juna Akhara on Saturday night. The expulsion followed allegations of abusive language directed at his Guru , Mahant Someshwar Puri .As a result, Singh has been banned from entering the Akhara camp and its surroundings. The Akhara emphasised that discipline and devotion to one’s Guru are core principles of Sanyas, and anyone who fails to uphold them cannot be considered a Sanyasi.“The act of Abhey Singh goes against the Guru-Shishya (master-disciple) tradition and the principles of Sanyas. Disrespecting one’s Guru shows a lack of respect for Sanatan Dharma and the Akhara. Discipline is of utmost importance in Juna Akhara, and no one is above it—not me, nor anyone like Singh,” said Mahant Hari Giri, Chief Patron of Juna Akhara.He further stated that every member of the Akhara must abide by strict discipline. Singh, however, violated these rules by using offensive language against his Guru. “Not only the Guru, but no one is allowed to speak against a fellow seer. Based on this violation, the Akhara’s disciplinary committee recommended his expulsion,” Giri added.The chief patron clarified that Abhey Singh will remain barred from the Akhara until he learns to respect his Guru and adhere to its discipline.Abhey Singh, who was a disciple of Mahant Someshwar Puri of Juna Akhara, left his career in aerospace engineering after graduating from IIT-Bombay to become a saint.He gained significant fame at the fair this year, particularly after a viral interview with a news channel turned him into an overnight celebrity. His story was widely covered by leading newspapers and TV channels.With over one lakh followers on Instagram, Singh gained attention for his controversial reel, where he referred to his father as ""Hiranyakashyap"" and his Guru as ""Pagal"" (mad) after a disagreement between them. This sparked widespread demands for action against him within the Akhara, ultimately leading to his expulsion on Saturday night.Previously, Singh’s Guru had expelled him from the camp, but Singh refused to leave the fair and instead sought refuge in the camp of another saint.","Engineer Abhey Singh, popularly known online as ""IITian Baba,"" was expelled from Juna Akhara on Saturday night.

He entered India illegally and adopted multiple identities, including ""Vijay Das.""

He worked in Mumbai for five to six months, employed by a housekeeping agency.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A. No proper investigation has been done,"" he said","Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

Govt may lift ban on lawyers fighting cases to get elderly their maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-may-lift-ban-on-lawyers-fighting-cases-to-get-elderly-their-maintenance/articleshow/117380038.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The Centre is mulling lifting the ban on lawyers in trial proceedings under the law to secure maintenance for neglected parents , but without compromising the core idea which barred them in the first place.Sources said a proposal is on the table to allow lawyers to take up cases of senior citizens before tribunals under the “Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act”, while keeping the bar intact on use of legal professionals by children against whom the cases are filed.The nudge for the change has come from the “learning experience”, where the seniors face difficulty in articulating their case before tribunals, handicapping them against their progeny in arguments to prove neglect and maltreatment. It is felt that engaging lawyers will help the elderly in fighting their claims and securing maintenance.Section 17 of the Act states, “Notwithstanding anything contained in any law, no party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate tribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner.”The social justice and empowerment ministry’s proposal, if it comes to fruition, would mark a major departure from the provisions of the Act where lawyers were kept out after much brainstorming within the govt, and with stakeholders, when the law was framed in 2007. The philosophy behind such a stand was that the Act was being put in place to enable the elderly to fight neglect and ill treatment by their children, in what was the first of its kind of dedicated legislation to address the problems faced in families across generations.But it was felt that such a provision would deliver results only if the trials were speedy and without legal manoeuvrings that are part of courtroom processes. The law lays down that an application for maintenance has to be disposed of within 90 days. The ban on lawyers was specifically to help the older generation, while the stress of the process has been on reconciliation rather than penal provisions which are also provided for in the law.So, while lawyers may in the future be allowed to participate in the proceedings, it would still be to help the seniors.Over 17 years, the Centre stuck to the “no-lawyer” stance despite nudges from various sections, including the high courts of Punjab and Haryana, and Madras. A panel constituted by the ministry in 2016 rejected the suggestion to lift the bar on legal practitioners by arguing that the provision helped in dispensing speedy and cost-effective justice to senior citizens.At a “national consultation” on the issue in Aug 2016, the Bar Council of India dubbed as “outdated” the perception that participation of lawyers hits speedy justice, but its plea for allowing lawyers in tribunals was met with strong resistance from states, NGOs and also the Law Commission.","The Centre is mulling lifting the ban on lawyers in trial proceedings under the law to secure maintenance for neglected parents.

PRYAGRAJ: As the Maha Kumbh unfolds to mark the world’s largest gathering of people over the 45-day mela that started on Jan 13, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence-enabled monitoring of population density per square metre, inflow and outflow of people and ground assessments by authorities shows that on a regular day around 10-15 lakh people are estimated to be visiting the mela and belong to the “floating” lot of visitors who come and go.Another 50 to 60 lakh people are estimated to be staying in Maha Kumbh Nagar , taking the total number of people present at the mela on any given day to 65-70 lakh.On the first day of the mela on Jan 13 – known as Paush Purnima nearly 1.65 crore devotees converged at the Triveni Sangam and the ghats along the river. On Jan 14, the number of visitors shot up to 3.5 crore. Now, the administration is gearing up for Jan 29 when nearly 6 crore people are expected to participate in the Shahi Snan on Mauni Amavasya.With nearly 40 crore people expected to throng to Maha Kumbh Nagar, at the core of this monitoring exercise are the Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCC) where hundreds of police personnel, officials and experts are busy keeping a watch on every alert on their screen to check and issue directions to avert a stampede, check barricade breaches, streamline traffic management and even check crime.TOI visited one of the ICCCs to understand what goes on behind the scenes to arrive at the numbers being cited by the administration. As large screens, throw up images of the busy ghats, data charts reflect how AI is delivering real-time information on population density and the people entering and leaving ghats from more than half a dozen prime entry and exit points.Superintendent of police, in-charge of ICCCs, Amit Kumar said that with thousands of cameras capturing the crucial data in the Kumbh area and the city, AI is proving to be an enabler in addition to the institutional ground information from the area and railways and road transport department. He shared that using the information, the police are also able to send out alerts on deciding on diversions and act in time to prevent overcrowding. He said AI is helping them bolster not just estimates of visitors but also engage in traffic management and check crime.A team is also working to collate data from different departments and ministries like railways, road and transport and highways.Additional DM Vivek Chaturvedi saidthe AI model being used at the ICCCs has been tested repeatedly on population density per square metre and related algorithms that reflected an accuracy of 90 to 92%.",Maha Kumbh is the world’s largest gathering of people over the 45-day mela that started on Jan 13.

NEW DELHI: Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for his “hypocrisy” on the caste census issue, key NDA constituent Janata Dal (United) on Sunday accused the Congress member of maintaining silence when Bihar CM Nitish Kumar raised the matter in INDIA bloc meetings. The Kumar-led JD(U), which was part of the INDIA bloc before he snapped ties with the opposition alliance and joined hands with BJP, also asked why Congress govt in Karnataka has not released the state’s caste data.JD(U) working president and MP Sanjay Jha ’s attack on Gandhi came a day after he slammed the caste survey carried out by the Kumar-led govt as a fake exercise at an event in Patna, while pitching for a nationwide caste census.“There cannot be a bigger hypocrisy than this. I was a witness to Gandhi maintaining silence while Kumar strongly and logically spoke in favour of caste census at INDIA bloc meetings in several places,” Jha told reporters.Incidentally, Bihar’s caste survey was carried out and its findings were released when Congress was a partner in the govt led by Kumar. Jha said Kumar was the only leader who raised the issue of caste census, and all INDIA bloc members were a witness.Defending caste survey in Bihar , he said Kumar is the only leader since 1931, when a nationwide caste census was held last, who decided to count population of different castes in a scientific manner to further social justice .Taking a swipe at Gandhi, he said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha should be more specific and tell people if he believes that Bihar’s caste survey has overcounted some communities and undercounted some others.Jha said Kumar has used the figures to expand the scope of reservations, though the issue is currently sub-judice. Slamming Congress, he said its govt in Karnataka has been sitting over the caste-wise population data in the state for several years.","JD(U) working president and MP Sanjay Jha ’s attack on Gandhi came a day after he slammed the caste survey carried out by the Kumar-led govt as a fake exercise.

No, Crimes Are a Result of Choice Yes, It Can Influence Actions

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing investigation into the stabbing case of Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan, a fresh angle has emerged as the accused’s advocate has questioned claims about his Bangladeshi origin. The advocate, Sandeep Shekhane, stated that police have no evidence to prove that Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad , the accused, is a Bangladeshi national .Shortly after Shehzad’s arrest on Sunday morning from Hiranandani Estate in Thane, police said he had entered India six months ago from Bangladesh. However, Shekhane refuted these allegations, asserting that his client has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family.“Police custody for five days has been granted, and the court has directed them to submit a report within this time frame. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. The claim that he came here six months ago is false. This is a clear violation of Section 43A as no proper investigation has been conducted,” Shekhane said.He has also alleged procedural lapses in the case and questioned the grounds on which police custody was granted.Sherkhane said, “There are lapses. The notice was not complied with as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court. Police custody was given, but there is no mention of threatening of life or murder in the remand copy or FIR copy. Despite this, sections are being implicated. There was no intention of murder.”Another advocate of accused, Dinesh Prajapati also refuted these allegations, saying that his client has been living in Mumbai with his family.“The police demanded custody, but the grounds provided were insufficient,” Prajapati said. “In his defence, we argued that nothing has been recovered from him, and the police have not produced any documents proving he is a Bangladeshi national. Despite this, the court has granted a five-day police custody.”Shehzad, 30, is accused of attacking Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence in the wee hours of Thursday. The intruder allegedly broke into Khan’s upscale home and stabbed him multiple times with a knife.The actor sustained injuries to his neck and near the spine and is currently being treated at Lilavati Hospital , where he is in stable condition.Police are now probing whether the attack was premeditated and if Shehzad had any accomplices.

PRAYAGRAJ: A cluster of 40 huts and six tents at the Maha Kumbh site was gutted in a fire triggered by successive LPG cylinder explosions in Sector 19 on Sunday afternoon, coinciding with CM Yogi Adityanath's visit to Sangam to take stock of preparations for Mauni Amavasya. No casualties or injuries to pilgrims were reported as fire safety teams swiftly evacuated the approximately 25 people inside camps in the vicinity, officials said.PM Modi called Adityanath later to enquire about the fire, originating from a gas leak in the kitchen of the Gita Press camp at 4.08pm. The blaze was controlled within an hour and the area was declared safe by 7pm. NDRF, SDRF and police teams were part of the operation long with 45 fire engines and over 200 fire services personnel, deputy director of fire services Aman Sharma told TOI.Witnesses said they heard at least three cylinder blasts before flames engulfed the tents. Chief fire officer (Prayagraj) RK Pandey said the thatched roofs of some tents fuelled the flames. “The situation is normal now, and losses are being assessed,” additional DGP Bhanu Bhaskar said.The area assigned to Gita Press, which publishes religious texts, and some adjacent stalls suffered the most damage. Some Maha Kumbh participants said they lost an unspecified amount of cash in the blaze. “The fire department received information about the Gita Press camp being engulfed in flames around 4.08pm, and we moved four fire engines immediately,” Sharma said. “There was an alert from the fire watchtower at Jhunsi, too, after our personnel noticed smoke billowing out of tents in Sector 19.”As thick clouds of smoke enveloped the area where most of the akharas had set up camps, there was panic as people ran to safety.

CHENNAI: A video of IIT-Madras director V Kamakoti extolling the medicinal benefits of ‘ gaumutra ’ (cow urine) has gone viral and drawn criticism that he is peddling pseudo-science .At an event at a cow shelter on Maatu Pongal (Jan 15), a Tamil festival celebrating cattle, Kamakoti said ‘gomutra’ possessed “anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and digestive properties” and could be a remedy for conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome.In the video, Kamakoti also narrated an anecdote about a sanyasi who, he said, recovered from high fever 15 minutes after consuming ‘gaumutra’.The IIT-Madras director linked his remarks to the broader importance of organic farming, emphasising the role of indigenous cattle in agriculture and the economy.

Poll Should Military Equipment Modernization Be Prioritized? No, There Are More Pressing Concerns Yes, It’s Critical for National Security

NEW DELHI: The Army is now putting its full weight behind the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems , with orders worth Rs 10,200 crore for its ammunition to be cleared soon, even as India is also exporting the systems to other countries.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said two Pinaka contracts — Rs 5,700 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented ammunition and Rs 4,500 crore for area denial munitions — are all set to be inked before the current fiscal ends on March 31. These orders will cater for the 10 Pinaka regiments already ordered by the over 11-lakh strong Army, which also has three Russian-origin Smerch and five Grad rocket regiments.While the force has inducted four Pinaka regiments, with some of the launchers also deployed in high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China, the other six are in the process of being inducted to add “more punch and lethality” to its arsenal. “The Pinaka is one of the best rocket systems in the world. Its regiments have been high-altitude enabled,” a senior officer said.The high-explosive pre-fragmented ammunition has a strike range of 45 km, while the aerial denial munitions can be launched to a distance of 37 km. The latter have the capability to saturate a target area with multiple bomblets, including anti-tank and anti-personnel minelets.DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range. With the plan underway to further enhance the range first to 120 km and then to 300 km, Gen Dwivedi said, “As soon as we get longer ranges, we might drop plans for other alternate long-range weapons we are looking at and concentrate on it (Pinaka).”The six new Pinaka regiments, under contracts inked with defence PSU Bharat Earth Movers Ltd and private sector companies Tata Advanced Systems and Larsen & Toubro, comprise 114 launchers with automated gun aiming and positioning systems and 45 command posts, along with 330 vehicles. “They are equipped with electronically and mechanically improved weapon systems capable of firing a variety of ammunition over longer ranges,” another officer said.India is also stepping-up plans to export the Pinaka system, along with other products like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and Akash air defence missile systems, to ‘friendly’ countries.The former Soviet republic of Armenia, for instance, is importing both Pinaka and Akash systems, as earlier reported by TOI. Some Asean, African and European countries have also shown interest in acquiring the Pinaka systems. Another major deal to be inked within this fiscal for the Army’s Regiment of Artillery will be the Rs 8,500 crore one for 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery gun systems, which is touted to have a strike range of 48 km.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said two Pinaka contracts — Rs 5,700 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented ammunition and Rs 4,500 crore for area denial munitions — are all set to be inked before the current fiscal ends on March 31.

NEW DELHI: While stating its intent to work on a “meaningful trade agenda” with the European Union, India has underlined the need for it to be “fair and equitable” and made it clear that there was a need to address tariff and non-tariff barriers.During his first meeting with Maroš Šefovi, the European commissioner for trade and economic security in Brussels over the weekend, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal also asserted that the cooperation on trade and sustainable development should factor in the respective level of developments of the two trading partners and “the principle of common but differentiated responsibility” should be followed that does not put additional burden on a developing country like India.The high-level dialogue is a part of attempts by India and EU to work out a foundation for negotiations for a free trade agreement in which the European trading bloc is also seeking dedicated chapters with commitment on issues such as sustainability, gender and labour. India is of the view that European standards cannot be imposed on it given its level of development prompting the Union minister to lay down the stand while outlining the six key principles.“India would work together with the European Union for developing cutting edge technologies, secure critical raw material supply chains and build resilient supply chains which will reduce dependencies on non-market economies and help developing closer economic ties between India and the EU,” said Goyal during the meet.

Suspect was planning to break into another flat in building Saif lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suspect-was-planning-to-break-into-another-flat-in-building-saif-lives/articleshow/117381868.cms,"CCTV grab of attacker

MUMBAI: The sheer randomness of the attack on the Saif Ali Khan household was underscored by the suspect ’s alleged confession to police that he had tried to break into another flat in the same building before he entered the actor’s house on the 11th floor. Khan occupies four floors at the top of the 13-storey Sadguru Sharan building. The attempted break-in at the other flat proved unsuccessful, which then prompted him to enter Khan’s house through the duct.The out-of-work Shariful had done a recce on Dec 31, 2024, departing from the Worli-Koliwada staff room where he was temporarily staying for a New Year’s night walk. He arrived at Bandra station and hired an autorickshaw to explore areas in Bandra and Khar until the following morning. “He even inquired with the rickshaw driver, whom he hired, to take him to the locality that houses businessmen and celebrities. After studying the topography, he planned to strike on Jan 15 night,” said police.At midnight on Jan 16, Shariful arrived at Bandra station and chose to walk rather than use public transport, he told police. He walked for almost two hours starting from Bandra to Khar and finally reached Satguru Sharan where Khan lives with his actress-wife Kareena Kapoor Khan and family. Shariful walked through several bylanes in Khar to avoid being captured on CCTV cameras and finally reached the actor’s 13-storey building. He told cops he found it plush enough and decided to strike.He entered the building after jumping over a four-feet wall of the adjacent building premises. The watchman at Satguru Sharan was snoozing. He used a ladder lying in the building premises to climb 12 feet to reach a duct from where he climbed using the pipeline. Since the duct was covered with a pigeon mesh on the fourth floor, he got out of it and entered the fire escape stairwell and climbed up to the 10th floor. This was when his image was captured (face covered with a scarf) in the only CCTV camera on the sixth floor. On the 10th floor, he again entered the duct to climb into the actor’s flat from the bathroom window,” said a police officer.Investigations showed that after fleeing the actor’s 11th floor apartment in Satguru Sharan building at 2.30 am on Jan 16, he jumped 12 feet from the first-floor level to the ground floor to escape. By then, there was a commotion in the actor’s household. The intruder who was spotted by a maid outside the actor’s son’s bedroom had raised an alarm, which led to a confrontation and a fight with Khan and his domestic staff. They had attempted to lock up the intruder in a room but failed to secure the door. After the family rushed downstairs to seek help, the intruder had fled. “The victims thought they had locked the door but it was the intruder who seems to have locked it from inside before he escaped from the fire escape stairwell which was captured in the CCTV,” said the police.","The out-of-work Shariful had done a recce on Dec 31, 2024, departing from the Worli-Koliwada staff room where he was temporarily staying for a New Year’s night walk.

Actor Saif Ali Khan ’s doctors on Sunday said he would need a long period of bed rest. “He is doing well, and prior to discharge, we need to plan his home care because he will have to remain on prolonged bed rest,” Dr Nitin Dange, the neurosurgeon who performed the operation to remove the knife lodged in the actor’s thoracic spine at Lilavati Hospital , said. Asked if the police had recorded Khan’s statement, Dr Dange said: “All we can say is that everything has been cleared up.”Hospital COO Dr Niraj Uttamani said Khan they had not planned the discharge yet. “We will likely reassess the situation tomorrow (Monday),” he said.Khan’s mother, Sharmila Tagore , wife, Kareena Kapoor Khan , and others visited him in Lilavati through Sunday.His sister Soha Ali Khan sounded relieved about his condition as she spoke at an event Sunday. “We are very, very happy that he is recovering well, and we are very thankful and we feel very blessed and grateful that it wasn’t any worse.

A police team scanning CCTV footage looked at visuals from nearly 500 cameras to track the accused in the Saif Ali Khan case. One of the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations was the colour and pattern of his shoes. A team led by deputy commissioner of police Dikshit Gedam went through footage from cameras starting from the actor’s building, going towards Linking Road and Bandra station , then Dadar and Worli before tracking him to Thane. Other members of the team included assistant commissioner Adikrao Pol, senior inspector Sanjay Marathe, inspectors Ajay Lingnurkar and Sachin Rane, assistant inspectors Vijay Acharaker, Bajrang Jagtap, Tushar Sawant, and staff.After escaping from the actor’s flat, Shariful loitered around in the Bandra and Khar locality for almost five-and-a-half hours before catching a train from Bandra station to Dadar. By then, he had had a haircut, had a bath, and changed his clothes. “When we started scanning through the CCTV we found the accused near Sadhu Vaswani Petrol pump in Bandra (West) on Linking road where he was found to have changed his shirt. As he knew, there was CCTV footage ahead, he crossed the road. But he was captured in the CCTV of a Khar hotel. After walking for almost a hour and a half, he slept at Khar station at 4 am before returning to Bandra in the morning and taking a train at 8 am to Dadar,” said police.“We kept watching the leg and the shoe for three hours and finally found the person on the CCTV near National College in Khar. It resembled the CCTV image captured at the actor’s building. Then we found him at Bandra railway station and then outside Dadar where he purchased some mobile accessories before he boarded a bus to Worli on January 16. There he walked till he reached Worli-Koliwada and stayed in a room where the pub staff hired by Pandey stayed. “On Jan 17, in the afternoon he left Worli and reached Thane and hid in a labour camp before he was arrested,” said the police.DCP (Zone IX) Dikshit Gedam said, ""He had illegally entered the country before reaching Mumbai. He was in Mumbai and Thane for the last six months and has used different names. We are collecting details about the documents he has created. He moved to Thane a few months ago before he returned to Mumbai 15 days ago before executing the offence. He was working with some housekeeping agency in Thane before he committed the offence and was caught within 72 hours.""""He was in urgent need of money and planned to rob anyone and immediately escape to Bangladesh,’’ said another officer. During the search at Thane, the police team had almost given up hope after combing the area on the city’s outskirts through the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. By 2am, they had scanned 30-40 acres of land comprising nullahs and thorny bushes. The seniors kept egging their juniors on. Finally, the breakthrough came when one of them shone a torch on some bushes and found the accused lying there.","The colour and pattern of his shoes were the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations.

PM lauds EC for fair polls, says vote in maximum numbers



NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Sunday heaped praise on Election Commission for strengthening democracy through fair polls and using the power of technology to “strengthen people’s power”, his remarks coming amid continuing attacks on the poll body by opposition parties.In the year’s first episode of Mann Ki Baat , Modi said, ""I would like to thank Election Commission, which has modernised and strengthened our voting process from time to time. EC has used the power of technology to strengthen people’s power.""The PM said, “I congratulate the EC for its commitment to fair elections. I would like to urge countrymen to use their right to vote, always, in maximum numbers and also become a part of the country’s democratic process and strengthen this process.” Modi’s endorsement of the EC comes at a time when the poll body faces criticism from Congress and other opposition parties over its conduct of elections. The opposition has alleged discrepancies in the voters list and also in voter turnout numbers, particularly in the Maharashtra assembly polls . They have also constantly cast doubts on electronic voting machines despite the Supreme Court rejecting all allegations against the reliability of EVMs.The PM mentioned National Voters’ Day celebrated on Jan 25 and called it important as on this day, the EC was established. “Our Constitution makers have accorded a very important place to our EC and equally to people’s participation in democracy,” he said. “When the first elections were held in the country in 1951-52, some people were doubtful whether the country's democracy would survive. But our democracy proved all the apprehensions wrong, after all, India is the mother of democracy,” he added.Modi also emphasised on unity and how the founding guardians envisaged the Constitution as an instrument to achieve this objective. He said India’s unity, as envisioned by its founders, was in its diversity and the collective spirit of its people.Ahead of the 75th anniversary of its Republic Day , Modi invoked the luminaries of the Constituent Assembly and played archival audio clips of three members — B R Ambedkar, Rajendra Prasad and Syama Prasad Mookerjee.He highlighted Ambedkar’s role and said, “Babasaheb had been emphasising the fact that the Constituent Assembly should be united, have one opinion and work together for the common good.” The PM also mentioned Prasad’s cultural approach to unity and Mookerjee’s call for equality of opportunities.",PM Modi heaped praise on Election Commission for strengthening democracy through fair polls.

NEW DELHI: Calling ‘ Maha Kumbh ’ a celebration of “unity in diversity”, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said the festival being a “confluence of equality and harmony” tells how the traditions bind the whole of India together, and cited several other examples of similar religious festivals along the banks of different rivers across the country.‘Maha Kumbh’ is under way at ‘Sangam’ — confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — in UP’s Prayagraj.“People from all over India and the world congregate on the sands of the Sangam. There is no discrimination, no casteism anywhere in this tradition which has been going on for thousands of years... In the Kumbh, the rich and the poor come together as one. All of them take a dip at the Sangam, dine together in the ‘bhandaras’, receive ‘prasad’ that is why the Kumbh is the Maha Kumbh of unity,” said Modi in his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ — the first for this year.He narrated how the ways of “adhering to the beliefs are the same” from north to south, and cited examples of ‘Kumbh’ being organised at Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nasik and Haridwar in the north, and ‘Pushkaram’ on the banks of Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Kaveri rivers in the south.“Both these festivals are connected with our holy rivers and their beliefs. Similarly, from Kumbakonam to Tirukkad-Yur, from Kood-Vasal to Tirucherai, there are many such temples whose traditions are connected with Kumbh,” he said.Referring to the ‘ Ganga Sagar Mela ’, organised in West Bengal, he said, “On the auspicious occasion of Sankranti, lakhs of devotees from all over the world took a dip at this fair. ‘Kumbh’, ‘Pushkaram’ and ‘Ganga Sagar Mela’ — these festivals of ours are festivals that enhance our social coalescence, harmony, unity.”He also lauded efforts of Indian scientists for their achievements and specifically mentioned their success in undertaking space docking of satellites that made India the fourth country to have achieved this success.Modi said scientists are making efforts to grow plants in space. “For this, ISRO scientists chose cow pea seeds. These, sent on Dec 30, germinated in space. This is a very inspiring experiment which will pave the way for growing vegetables in space in the future,” he said.","‘Maha Kumbh’ is under way at ‘Sangam’ — confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — in UP’s Prayagraj.

VIJAYAWADA: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that India has emerged as a global leader in disaster management through its revolutionary approach under Prime Minister Narendra Modi by adopting a ‘zero-casualty goal’ during calamities.After inaugurating the south campus of National Institute of Disaster Management and National Disaster Response Force 10th battalion buildings at Kondapavuluru near in Vijayawada, Shah said while earlier the approach to disaster was relief-centric, this has now undergone 360-degree change, becoming ‘rescue-centric’ to save people.“India has taken a lead in the entire world in disaster-resilient infrastructure by setting up CDRI ( Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure ) under PM Modi’s leadership,” he said, adding that 48 countries have become members of CDRI.Attacking the erstwhile Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy regime, he said the governance in Andhra Pradesh from 2019 to 2024 was a “man-made disaster” and assured NDA govt’s commitment to rescue the state from the crisis.At a meeting later, Shah spoke of Centre’s support to Andhra, emphasising that Rs 3 lakh crore has been extended to the state in six months. Shah stressed on the timely completion of Amaravati revamping. He said CM N Chandrababu Naidu has full support of PM Modi and both leaders will together streamline development and administration in the state.",Amit Shah said India has emerged as a global leader in disaster management.

VIJAYAWADA: Asserting that the TDP-led NDA govt in Andhra Pradesh has been successful in securing Rs 4 lakh crore investments in just seven months, minister for IT and HRD Nara Lokesh said it is essential to have consistent policies and continuity in governance. The national general secretary of TDP said the first question they receive from investors in India and abroad is about what happens if there is a change of govt in the state.Lokesh, who is responsible for big-ticket investments like Google, Reliance, and TCS in the state, said it took a lot of perseverance to convince industry giants to set shop in Andhra after the “devastating” five-year rule of YSRCP. “People of AP should also make a distinction between the previous destructive govt and the present NDA govt. They have to judge two models of governance and ensure the state continues on the path of development by electing NDA in successive terms,” he said.In an interview to STOI, Lokesh said the govt is working to make Andhra a preferred investment destination with the speed of doing business. “We want to compete with not only our fellow states but also with countries like Dubai and Singapore,” he said.He thanked Union govt for its “amazing support” to the state and said it would be a crime at some point if they ask for more. “Capital Amaravati and Polavaram are on track now, and Visakhapatnam steel plant is getting revived. BPCL refinery, NTPC green hydrogen project, and railway line to Amaravati are happening with the support of Union govt,” he mentioned.Responding to the implementation of ‘Red Book’ (a record maintained by Lokesh before the assembly polls), he said it was endorsed by the people, and it is one of the reasons people came out to vote in large numbers. However, he clarified that it will not be used for vindictive politics.","Nara Lokesh is responsible for big-ticket investments like Google, Reliance, and TCS in the state.

Goon hiding in US ‘kingpin’ of Punjab grenade attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goon-hiding-in-us-kingpin-of-punjab-grenade-attacks/articleshow/117379925.cms,"Harpreet Singh alias Happy Passia

CHANDIGARH: Elusive gangster Harpreet Singh alias Happy Passia is no ordinary fugitive. His roots are modest — a matriculate from an agriculturist family in Passia village of Punjab’s Amritsar district. Yet his ascent in the criminal world has been anything but humble. Currently said to be hiding in US, Passia is allegedly the mastermind behind a recent string of grenade attacks in Punjab. He uses “burner” phone numbers, each with a different country code, to avoid detection and communicate with “gullible youth” enlisted as “foot soldiers” for terrorist strikes in Punjab , a state police officer said. NIA has been on his trail, tracking several phone numbers tied to Passia.He travelled to Dubai in 2018 and returned in 2019. “He went to London in 2020 and did not return,” a police officer said. Passia has criminal associates in UK, where he spent a few months in 2020-21 before moving to US, slipping across the Mexico border through illegal channels, according to details compiled by Punjab police and accessed by TOI. Passia’s criminal dossier is extensive. He is wanted in 17 cases under laws such as UAPA, Arms Act, and NDPS Act. Twelve of these cases were filed between Nov 2022 and April 2024.The saga turns darker with Passia’s alleged collaboration with Pakistan-based Harwinder Singh alias Rinda, a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist. Together, they coordinate attacks in Punjab. Passia has been declared a fugitive, with a Chandigarh court issuing an arrest warrant against him last week on an NIA application.","Harpreet Singh alias Happy Passia is wanted in 17 cases under laws such as UAPA, Arms Act, and NDPS Act.

Government readies new strategy for higher education institutes to boost students' mental health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-readies-new-strategy-for-higher-education-institutes-to-boost-students-mental-health/articleshow/115130110.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre is rolling out a comprehensive mental health and well-being programme for higher education institutions (HEIs) across India.In a collaborative effort, over 200 institutions, including premier IITs, IIMs, NITs, and central and state universities, 350 students and faculty, are engaged in discussions to strengthen mental health support mechanisms.Govt has outlined a four-pronged strategy that includes capacity building and model institution visits. A National Wellbeing Conclave underway at IIT Hyderabad will set a structured framework for psychosocial support among students in HEIs.The programme's holistic approach targets both immediate needs and preventive measures for long-term mental health improvement. It aims to help students in need while fostering an environment that encourages healthy behaviours and prevents the onset of mental health disorders.For the first time, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman included mental health in the Economic Survey 2023-24, presented in Parliament on July 22, 2024. Acknowledging mental health as a key driver of national development, the Survey cited findings from National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16, indicating that 10.6% of Indian adults suffer from mental disorders, with a significant treatment gap of 70-92%. Mental health challenges are particularly prevalent in urban metros, where 13.5% of the population is affected, compared to 6.9% in rural and 4.3% in urban non-metro areas. Additionally, an NCERT survey reported worsening mental health among adolescents, a trend exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic.In line with these findings, the Conclave on Sunday is bringing together educators, students, mental health experts, and policymakers. The event, themed ""Integrated Approach for Promoting Mental Health, Resilience and Wellbeing,"" aims to address the urgent need for mental health support in HEIs, deliberating on general mental health awareness to managing severe mental health conditions, helping institutions implement a structured, multi-tiered support system.Guided by National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, ministry of education has initiated a framework for HEIs focusing on physical and mental health. Ahead of the conclave, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan told TOI, ""This framework encourages institutions to create environments conducive to students' social, emotional, and academic growth. Several HEIs, including IIT Madras with its KUSHAL programme, have introduced wellness initiatives that include surveys, grievance redressal, counselling, and peer support networks. Other institutions, such as IIIT Allahabad, have incorporated AI-driven mental health monitoring, while others engage families to support students' well-being.""","Govt has outlined a four-pronged strategy that includes capacity building and model institution visits.

CJI: Pressure on judges from private interest groups as well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-pressure-on-judges-from-pvt-interest-groups-as-well/articleshow/115128910.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pressure on judges comes not just from the political executive, but also from private interest groups , CJI D Y Chandrachud said, during an extensive and frank interaction as Guest Editor of The Times Of India on Saturday.Elaborating, the CJI, who demits office on Monday, said private interest groups use news TV and social media to create an atmosphere where a judge often feels pressured to go in a particular direction. The price of independence here, he pointed out, is to be subjected to heavy trolling. ""You will be trolled, you will be attacked,"" he said. On the larger issue of judicial independence , Justice Chandrachud said it's wrong to measure independence only by looking at judgments where the Supreme Court went against govt views. ""It's a reflection of the state of our polity today,"" he observed, arguing polarised views mean that each ""end of the spectrum"" judges SC's independence by whether the court concurs with it. ""I think I have tried to draw a balance,"" the CJI said. He added he's never tried to fit a judgment to a preconceived view, rather he's gone where his judicial reasoning took him.But the CJI and all high court chief justices need to work with govts on the administrative side, Justice Chandrachud said, recounting his efforts to improve judicial infrastructure , funds for which come from govts. Consultation with govts is also key to resolving court-executive differences , he said, illustrating his point with the SC collegium-Centre differences on selecting judges, an issue that has hit headlines many times.""I have always been candid with the govt,"" CJI said, referring to times when the govt has pushed back on a collegium decision. ""But all differences can't be resolved,"" he added frankly. On perhaps the best-known example of those differences - the govt not yet okaying collegium's decision to appoint lawyer Saurabh Kirpal as an HC judge - the CJI said his view is that neither a prospective judge's sexuality nor the fact that his partner is a foreign citizen can be held against him when assessing his fitness for the job.A CJI known for the clarity with which he writes his judgments, he was emphatic in saying judgments written in archaic or bad English did disservice to those seeking justice. And demonstrating he himself was not attached to stale custom, he said he's for both doing away with the stuffy attire lawyers have to wear in a hot country and simple architecture, not forbiddingly grand, when it comes to building courthouses.","CJI D Y Chandrachud says pressure on judges comes not just from political executive, but also from private interest groups.

‘Bhavan katham asti?’ Sanskrit finds new life in Assam’s border villages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhavan-katham-asti-sanskrit-finds-new-life-in-assams-border-villages/articleshow/115128731.cms,"Concentration levels of kids up since Sanskrit shift, say locals

GUWAHATI: ""Ek kilo parimitam alookam dadatu,"" requested Amalendu, a villager in Patiala Basti, asking for a kilogram of potatoes. Shopkeeper Akbar responded: ""Astu dadami (take it).""This exchange, a scene from daily life, is just one of many where Sanskrit has become an integral part of communication in Anipur Basti and Patiala Basti near the Bangladesh border in southern Assam's Karimganj - a Muslim-majority district where the official language is Assamese and the native tongue is Bengali.Here, the 5,000-year-old language is not just a subject in textbooks but a language spoken fluently in everyday life. Villagers greet each other with a friendly ""namaskaram"" while callers exchange, ""Bhavan katham asti (How are you)?"" to which the reply is, ""Samyak asmi (I am fine).""Patiala is also witnessing a revival, with at least 50 residents fluent in Sanskrit.Around 300 of the 400 residents of Anipur Basti converse comfortably in Sanskrit, conducting business and even personal calls in the ancient language.Suman Kumar Nath, a local school teacher and resident of Anipur, is proud of the village's linguistic journey. ""Being the oldest language of the country, Sanskrit is a very rich language and a reservoir of our ancient knowledge,"" he said.For Nath, Sanskrit is not only a way to honour heritage but a means of accessing the knowledge embedded in the language. Nath's school, which educates 200 children, including 20 Muslim students, teaches all students to converse in Sanskrit. From Classes 1 to 10, every child learns Sanskrit.The revival began about nine years ago, when villagers attended workshops and educational programmes aimed at reintegrating Sanskrit into daily life.The benefits of learning Sanskrit have been noticeable, particularly in education. Patiala Basti resident Dipan Nath said that adopting Sanskrit has positively impacted students' performance.""Since using the language, the concentration level of the students has increased, and they have performed well in academics,"" he explained.He attributed this to Sanskrit's extensive vocabulary, which allows villagers to answer questions concisely, often in a single word.The resurgence has drawn the attention of academics and language experts. Dr Sudeshna Bhattacharya, head of Sanskrit department at Gauhati University, visited Patiala Basti and was amazed by what she saw.""Though many tend to label Sanskrit a 'dead language', the villagers, including those without formal education, have been doing commendable work by using it in their life,"" she said.Bhattacharya recalled her visit to the village, where a woman without formal schooling welcomed her in fluent Sanskrit. ""It was a powerful moment,"" she said.","Sanskrit has become an integral part of communication in two villages in southern Assam. Around 300 of the 400 residents of Anipur Basti converse comfortably in Sanskrit. At least 50 residents of Patiala Basti are fluent in the 5,000-year-old language.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115128815,imgsize-1321232,width-400,resizemode-4/115128815.jpg"

NAGPUR: When Vilas Kolha stands in line to vote at a polling booth in Gadchiroli during the Maharashtra assembly elections on Nov 20, it will be another victory for democracy. He will be among 137 surrendered Maoists casting votes across three constituencies in Gadchiroli.The ex-Maoist commander-in-chief of central India's stronghold in Abujmarh, carrying a record of 149 charges against him and a bounty of Rs 9.5 lakh, renounced extremism three years ago and became a staunch advocate of democracy. He first cast his ballot during 2024 LS polls. Kolha joined Maoists after his mother was branded a witch and nearly lynched.

Kolha, an IED expert and the only guerrilla to surrender with an AK-47, once led PLGA fighters in laying traps for polling parties and detonating explosives in the dense forests.Sources said Kolha held meetings in remote villages, urging tribal villagers to boycott elections, and organising violent campaigns to prevent politicians from entering these hamlets. He had also planned assassinations and destroyed EVMs to derail elections. He is now settled in Navjeevan Vasahaat and works as a driver for Lloyds Khonsari Steel Plant - a project he once opposed as a Maoist.

"Barring disabled a sign of bias, violates their rights, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-inclusion-of-disabled-in-med-practice-key-to-humane-outlook/articleshow/115128343.cms,"CJI: Inclusion of disabled in med practice key to humane outlook

NEW DELHI: Observing that no one wants to forfeit claim to pursue education or his/her preferred profession due to disability, Supreme Court has appealed for a change in the approach of govt authorities by focusing more on the ability and not the disability of such persons, and bring them into the social mainstream and allow the differently abled to pursue studies and jobs in their chosen field.Allowing the plea of a medical aspirant who was denied admission to MBBS course due to a faulty assessment of his ""disability"", the top court said that if reasonable accommodation is denied to a differently abled person, it would amount to discrimination and a violation of fundamental rights, which would not only demean the individual's aspirations but also harm the country as a whole.""The courts cannot be stupefied into inaction by the lack of adequate framework or expertise when questions of fundamental rights emerge. The flurry of cases concerning medical aspirants with disability which has come before this court shows that the overarching issue is a sense of over-medicalisation of disabled bodies by the assessment boards,"" said a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.""The approach often taken, due to inertia or unwittingly, is to assume that a person with disability may not be eligible for pursuing the course and then to put the candidates under tests to prove the assumption,"" it added.The approach focuses more on the disability of a person than their ability. This turns the principle of reasonable accommodation on its head. The question instead that the board ought to ask itself is this - what measures can be taken to ensure that the candidate with disability can start his/her MBBS course on an equal footing with their prospective classmates?"" the court said.This is one among the series of verdicts delivered in recent times to protect the interests of differently abled people who faced various bottlenecks in getting entry into educational institutions.On Oct 16, in a landmark verdict meant to demolish entry barriers for people with disability in educational institutions, Supreme Court had held that quantified disability by itself will not disentitle a candidate from being considered for admission in educational institutions, and they would be eligible for admission if the disability assessment board opines that the disability won't come in the way of pursuing a course of study. Earlier, SC had quashed a rule that barred colour-blind students from gaining admission to MBBS courses.CJI Chandrachud, who authored the verdict for the bench, said that the inclusion of persons with disabilities in medical practice is vital to ensure that the approach of the medical community, hospitals and other healthcare institutions is humane, sensitive, and informed by lived experiences. He said a society where discrimination and exclusion are addressed and eliminated will create a just and equitable system for all persons regardless of their identities.""Persons with disability are not objects of pity or charity but an integral part of our society and nation. The advancement of rights for persons with disabilities is a national project along with eradication of all forms of discrimination. A component of this project is the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all pursuits of life,"" the CJI said.","Supreme Court has appealed for a change in the approach of govt authorities by focusing more on the ability and not the disability of such persons.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations. After the lively Diwali celebrations on October 31, students get to enjoy several important religious holidays in the beginning of November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations.

The Canadian Govt has amended its visa policy: ""Guidance has been updated to indicate that multiple-entry visas issued to maximum validity are no longer considered to be the standard document. Officers may exercise their judgement in deciding whether to issue a single or multiple-entry visa, and in determining the validity period.""This change coming amid the long visa processing time in India has come as a big blow to Indians given the diaspora in Canada.Travel Agents Federation of India VP Anil Kalsi said: ""Canada used to mostly issue multiple entry visitor visas with a validity of 10 years subject to validity of passport. Which means if my passport has a validity of 8 years when my Canadian visa is approved, I will get the same for 8 years.The change in rule will severely impact travellers and hit visitations to Canada.

Pakistan on social media overdrive to revive terrorism in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-on-social-media-overdrive-to-revive-terrorism-in-kashmir/articleshow/115124996.cms,"New Delhi: An exponential rise in social media activity over the past month by Pakistan and PoK-based terrorist handles, aimed at glamourising terrorism and secessionism in J&K, as well as threatening anti-India posts, is being viewed by Indian security agencies as ""a fresh bid by Pakistan-backed terror outfits to revive local terror recruitment in J&K"", according to intelligence sources.An analysis by the agencies here of anti-India activities across ""identified"" Pakistan and PoK-based terror-linked accounts on platforms like Facebook, X, Telegram, Dark Web etc, revealed over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023. This translates to a more than 22-fold rise.Of the nearly 2,016 objectionable posts, more that 130 each were terrorism-specific and anti-India rants, 33 backed separatism and secessionism, and 310 were in the nature of threats to infrastructure and public places like schools etc, TOI has learnt.A senior officer in the central security establishment told TOI that the social media route to influence and exploit impressional minds of J&K youths and radicalise them for anti-national activities - something that had seen young Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani turn into a terror icon before he was killed in 2016 - follows a sharp decline in the number of local Kashmiris joining terrorist outfits. Just four locals in J&K - two from Shopian and one each from Srinagar and Tral - were recruited for terrorist activities till Nov this year, down from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. In fact, there are only 30 local terrorists operating in J&K as of now, as against 75-80 foreign terrorists.""Attempts at raising local recruitment may not point to plans for a troubled winter but to preparations for heightened terror activity in the summer of 2025,"" said an officer.The decline in local recruitment in the past few years was attributed by a senior J&K govt functionary to the central and the UT administration's zero-tolerance approach to terror over the past few years, which focused not only on tackling terrorists but also on dismantling the terror eco-system by choking funding and cracking down on overground supporters by denying them govt jobs and clearances for passports, driving licence, etc.Interestingly, the rise in terrorist outfits' social media outreach to J&K youths coincides with the installation of an elected govt in the UT.Agencies are probing whether the changed power equations in J&K, even though control of police remains with the LG, have emboldened the Pakistan-based terrorist masterminds to whip up trouble there. A recent intelligence input warned of the plan of Pakistan's ISI to target over a dozen Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in Kashmir through their terror associates ""in the near future"". This could be to create public unrest or possibly linked to JeI's decision to enter the political space by contesting the recent J&K assembly elections, a source told TOI.Drone activity, meanwhile, continues to be a concern in J&K, with 40 sightings reported until Oct this year as compared to 31 in the corresponding period of 2023.","Over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023.

""We are bringing in a new health insurance scheme, under which complicated surgeries and medical procedures costing up to Rs 15 lakh would be conducted free of cost,"" Rahul announced.He also accused PM Modi and BJP of being anti-poor.

Modi is not keen on a caste census. We, the INDIA bloc, will conduct the caste census. We will also remove the 50% reservation ceiling,"" he said.At his rally in Jamshedpur, too, the Amethi MP continued his tirade against the PM, blaming him for the country's economic woes and accusing him of practising crony capitalism. ""Unemployment has spread across the country due to Modi's wrong policies. Policies such as demonetisation and the GST were weapons to kill the poor, farmers and workers.

""The budget for highways was increased by 50 percent under PM Modi,"" he added.Emphasizing Modi’s efforts to uplift tribal communities, Nadda pointed out that the tribal welfare budget was tripled, funding for Eklavya model schools increased twenty-one times, and about 1.5 crore toilets were built for tribals as part of the 11 crore toilets constructed nationwide.In another rally in Bishrampur, Nadda claimed that Jharkhand’s citizens are frustrated with the JMM-led government’s “corruption and appeasement politics” and are ready to embrace ""good governance and development"" under Modi's leadership.

However, upon reaching the venue, she found only Siddiqui, who drugged her by lacing her soft drink with sedatives and raped her, while also recording the act.Siddiqui allegedly held her hostage in his flat for over six months, during which he repeatedly raped her and threatened her with dire consequences. Another teacher, Vikas Porwal, also raped her a few months later.The student mentioned in her FIR that she was afraid to seek police help, fearing it might put her family in danger. It wasn't until six months later, when her mother arrived in Kanpur and took her away, that she found the courage to approach the police.The breaking point came when she saw a video of Siddiqui sexually harassing another coaching student. Both teachers have been arrested and charged with offenses of rape, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation, and provisions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).","A minor student from Fatehpur, who moved to Kanpur to prepare for her medical entrance exam, Neet, was allegedly held hostage and raped by two teachers.

JAMMU: Residents of Ohli village in Kishtwar district of Jammu region gathered Saturday to bid a tearful farewell to two local village defence guards ( VDGs ) and friends whose bodies were discovered in ndarby Kuntwara forest after they were abducted and killed by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists Thursday morning.Nazir Ahmed, 42, and Kuldeep Kumar, 40, who were unarmed and grazing cattle in the area, were found bound, blindfolded, and shot from behind, officials said. This was Kumar’s first trip back to the forest since his father’s passing, as his friend Ahmed had been tending to his livestock while he was in mourning.The bodies were retrieved following a 12-hour search that concluded Friday evening. Late that night, the bodies were brought back to Ohli. Ahmed was buried in the local graveyard, while Kumar was cremated on the village outskirts.Locals, cutting across lines of caste and religion, united in paying respects and voiced their anger over the murders. “We want to tell Pakistan and their terrorists that we have lived together for years and will continue to do so. We will thwart their nefarious designs,” a villager said amid anti-terrorism and anti-Pakistan slogans .Ahmed, who leaves behind a wife, three sons, a daughter, and a physically disabled brother, was described as a pillar of his family. Kumar, who had lost his father only a week ago, is survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.“Shame on terrorists who cannot face our army and are shedding the blood of innocents,” a female relative of Ahmed said. “If they want to be good and want jihad, they should serve their parents dutifully — that is jihad.”A fellow VDG member emphasised the cowardice displayed in targeting unarmed civilians. “If the terrorists were brave enough, they should have given guns to the VDGs and had a fair fight, instead of blindfolding them with their hands tied behind and shooting them cowardly,” he said.The villagers demanded the authorities provide adequate ex gratia and govt jobs to the families of the slain VDGs, who had been the primary breadwinners for their households.They also demanded stronger counter-terrorism measures and called for additional VDG recruits to guard their mountainous forests of Kishtwar.A plea was also made for one VDG recruit from each of the 130 households in Ohli, which they said would offer better protection for their community.","Nazir Ahmed, 42, and Kuldeep Kumar, 40, were found bound, blindfolded, and shot from behind.

UP women’s panel proposes ban on male tailors and barbers for ladies: A move against ‘bad touch’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-womens-body-proposes-men-shouldnt-tailor-womens-clothes-or-cut-their-hair/articleshow/115077086.cms,"UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair

NEW DELHI: In an eyebrow-raising proposal aimed at safeguarding women, the Uttar Pradesh state women’s commission has suggested a ban on male tailors measuring women and male barbers styling women’s hair. The recommendation, which advocates for a female-only rule in tailoring and salons, is aimed at curbing instances of ""bad touch"" and discouraging ""ill intentions"" from male professionals, according to the commission.The proposal was made during a meeting on October 28, where women’s commission chairperson Babita Chauhan led the discussion, gaining support from the attending members. Himani Agarwal, a commission member, disclosed the details of the suggestion on Friday, as reported by PTI.""At the meeting, we proposed that only female tailors should take women’s measurements and that CCTV cameras should be installed in these areas to ensure women’s safety,"" Agarwal said. ""In salons, only female barbers should attend to female clients."" She explained that such restrictions could help prevent inappropriate behavior, adding, ""Some men in these professions do not have good intentions, which can lead to molestation.""Agarwal clarified that the intent isn’t to paint all men as predatory but to address specific instances where women have felt uncomfortable. ""Not all men have bad intentions,"" she said, acknowledging the potential sensitivities surrounding the proposal.Currently, the commission is in the early stages of pushing this idea and plans to appeal to the state government to consider formal legislation. While the proposal has sparked discussions on the necessity and practicality of such restrictions, the commission believes this measure could create a safer environment for women in Uttar Pradesh.","UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair.

UPA govt, led by Manmohan Singh, had formed a dedicated 'group of ministers' to discuss the issue but its prolonged discussions did not lead to any concrete output, despite touching a crescendo at one point. It is likely the second time that a top govt or parliamentary body will discuss the subject.The parliamentary committee on welfare of SCs/STs has listed it as part of its annual agenda of deliberations. Sources said the subject was mooted by Azad Samaj Party MP Chandrashekhar Azad in the first meeting of the panel to finalise list of business, and found support from others.The proposal to extend quotas to private sector, which has had some push from champions of social justice but never became a forceful demand, has a polarising edge. While its proponents argue that rapid privatisation is leading to shrinking of seats in govt sector that fall in ambit of reservations, other decry that it will hurt the economy and compromise merit in appointments in the industry and corporate sector. Some also argue that enforcing quotas in private bodies would be unconstitutional.Chairman of the committee, Faggan Singh Kulaste said, ""The issues are decided by the members.

The accused Shailendra Rajput was arrested in Gujarat's Ankleshwar town Saturday.Police said Rajput - currently posted in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh - had incurred losses worth Rs 16 lakh in the stock market and taken a loan. He kidnapped the child and demanded a ransom of Rs 5 lakh to repay his debt. The boy, Shubham Rajpal, was the son of an industrial worker and often went to Rajput's house to play. On Thursday, Rajput abducted Shubham and put tape on the kid's mouth to stop him from screaming or raising an alarm, causing the child to faint. ""Rajput then put the boy in a metal trunk. As per preliminary investigation, the child must have died before 5pm,"" said DSP Ankleshwar Kushal Oza.Shubham's family reported him missing to police around 6pm the same day. Though Shubham had died, Rajput called the family the next morning (Nov 8) demanding ransom. Cops suspect that by making the call the day after the abduction, Rajput wanted to mislead investigators and delay the probe so that he would have time to dispose of the body. Rajput planned to dump the body in a field behind his house or leave it on the terrace. The idea of misdirecting the probe came from crime shows and movies, he told cops. Rajput had made the ransom call from a cell phone he had found on a train. He had used the same phone to call unknown women in the past months. Police traced one of these women, who said she didn't know the caller but he wore an armed forces uniform on a video call.""We then started checking for people in the neighbourhood serving in the armed forces. We identified the accused and upon checking his home, found the trunk in which the body was kept,"" DSP Oza said. Police officials found Shubham's body with the limbs bound and mouth taped.

SC ticks off courts for blocking MBBS seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-ticks-off-courts-for-blocking-mbbs-seats/articleshow/115126027.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has disapproved of HC interim orders to keep a MBBS seat vacant in a medical college for a candidate alleging unfair denial of admission and said such a direction can be passed only in exceptional circumstances when a candidate presents a strong prima facie case.This order was passed by a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan who faced a piquant situation when two colleges approached the SC saying the HC, which had kept seats reserved for candidates, dismissed the petitions later and as deadline for admission has been over, the seats will now remain vacant for the entire course period of five years, causing huge loss to them.Writing the judgment, Justice Viswanathan said, ""Only if there is a cast iron case for the petitioner and the petitioner is bound to succeed in cases where the error of the respondent authorities is so gross as to negate any other conclusion, interim orders keeping seats vacant could be made.""The bench said courts certainly have the power to keep a seat reserved for candidates who have proved a prima facie strong case for their admission to a college, but court must do so with ""great caution and circumspection"".""In appropriate cases, even where the said exceptional criterion as set out above is met, the court will be justified in directing the petitioner to provide security, to the concerned college-institution where the seat is ultimately directed to be kept vacant or on whom ultimately the liability of the vacant seat would fall,"" the bench said, adding if the petition is dismissed the security deposit could be given to the colleges to make good their financial loss.Even when a seat is ordered to be kept vacant, the court passing the order to this effect must endeavour to decide the issue before conclusion of the counselling for admissions, it said.""It should not be forgotten that while the recurring and non-recurring expenditure for a college remains the same, a vacant seat will deprive the college of the fees to that extent, not just for one year but for the whole course, which could be four, five or more years,"" it said.Not inclined to create an additional seat for the next academic session in lieu of the vacant seat, the bench asked the colleges to approach the statutory Fee Fixation Committee with a request to allow a marginal hike in the fee to compensate the loss resulting from a seat going vacant due to court orders.",Supreme Court disapproves of HC interim orders to keep a MBBS seat vacant in a medical college for a candidate alleging unfair denial of admission.

"Minor NEET aspirant held hostage, raped for over six months in Kanpur; 2 teachers held",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minor-neet-aspirant-held-hostage-raped-for-over-six-months-in-kanpur-2-teachers-held/articleshow/115125708.cms,"KANPUR: A minor student from Fatehpur who moved here to prepare for her medical entrance exam NEET at a prominent coaching institute was allegedly held hostage for over six months and raped by two of its teachers. The student alleged in her complaint that a teacher recorded the assault and blackmailed her with threats of releasing the content of the video on social media, subjecting her to exploitation for months. She went into depression and filed the FIR a year later.Assistant commissioner of police (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Kumar Pandey said the case was registered on Friday after she approached the Kalyanpur police station. The student's medical examination was done, and her statement recorded on Saturday.Both teachers - Sahil Siddiqui, who taught biology, and Vikas Porwal, who taught chemistry - have been arrested and charged with offences of rape, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation and under provisions of Pocso Act . The student was 17 years old when this happened.In her complaint, the survivor told police that in January 2023, Siddiqui invited her to his friend's flat in Kalyanpur's Makdi-Khera area for a New Year's party, saying other students would be there as well.She alleged that when she reached the flat, she found only Siddiqui there who drugged her by lacing her soft drink with sedatives and raped her while also recording the episode on video.According to the complaint, Siddiqui allegedly held her hostage in his flat for over six months, during which he repeatedly raped her and also threatened to share the video online if she spoke to anyone about it.The student alleged that Porwal raped her a few months after this.She said in the FIR that she could not muster the courage to seek police help as she was afraid that it might land her family in danger.Six months later, the girl's mother arrived in Kanpur and took her along.Initially, the girl was hesitant to approach the police, but she made up her mind to take the step when she came across a video showing Siddiqui sexually harassing a coaching student.""An FIR has been registered against both accused teachers under the Pocso Act and other BNS sections, including 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 376(2)(n) (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 or more days) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation),"" said ACP (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Kumar Pandey.","A minor student from Fatehpur who moved here to prepare for her medical entrance exam NEET was allegedly held hostage for over six months and raped by two of its teachers.

Battle of buzzwords: Netas turn to hashtags for edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battle-of-buzzwords-netas-turn-to-hashtags-for-edge/articleshow/115125504.cms,"Read also:

MUMBAI: In the charged poll season, candidates are going all out on social media to ensure messages make a lasting impression. Timelines are buzzing as incumbents and new contenders work overtime to amplify their reach, using hashtags to stand out.From assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar, who is using #PaanchSaalBemisaal to highlight his work in Colaba since the last polls, to Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha's #Mihir4Mulund and Bhiwandi MLA Rais Shaikh's #RiseWithRais, each slogan is trying to capture campaigns' essence. Amin Patel, Mumbadevi MLA, is tapping into local sentiments in the minority-dominant constituency with #AwaamKiAwaaz and #AwaamOfMumbaadevi. His opponent, Sena's Shaina NC, is making use of #ShainaNC4MumbaDevi. Then there's incumbent Bandra West MLA Ashish Shelar, who is running #ApnaAshishHaiNa, and MP Lodha, Malabar Hill MLA, with #HameshaAapkeSaath.Some candidates' posts on X give updates on their group meetings, housing society visits and yatras to various corners of their constituencies.According to citizen groups on social media, these hashtags may be an effective way to connect with the electorate but they have a word of caution. ""With artificial intelligence already honing in on keywords across social media, they lack impact and serve little real purpose,"" said advocate Trivankumar Karnani, founder of Citizen Welfare Forum-Mumbai North Central District Forum, which raises citizens' issues on X.Mandeep Singh Makkar, founder of Chandivali Citizens Welfare Association , who handles @ChandivaliCCWA, said such hashtags are only a type of propaganda and may not convert into votes.""Today, the voter is smart enough and not ready to be manipulated by such hashtags. People would rather have their issues resolved than see such hashtags.""However, in an era where digital presence is crucial, some candidates believe that a powerful online identity can make some kind of impact. RTI activist Anil Galgali said while politicians understand hashtags may not make a huge difference, in today's scenario-where elections can be decided by just a few hundred votes-every vote matters. ""If social media can help them reach even a small segment of voters, no candidate wants to miss that opportunity."" Galgali referred to Sena's Ravindra Waikar beating Sena (UBT)'s Amol Kirtikar for the Mumbai North-West seat in the LS polls by just 48 votes-the narrowest margin across the country during the election.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said hashtags resonate with educated, cosmopolitan and elite voters. ""A hashtag might work to some extent for Narwekar in Colaba whose voters are educated. We've moved far from the days when autos with loudspeakers aired catchy taglines.""Jondhale credited BJP for pioneering the use of social media in elections. ""Take incumbent Bandra West MLA Ashish Shelar's hashtag #ApnaAshishHaiNa-it's informal, making voters feel he's one of them. This kind of language builds stronger rapport with voters,"" he said.","Candidates are going all out on social media to ensure messages make a lasting impression.

AI lends a new tech touch to campaigns this assembly poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-lends-a-new-tech-touch-to-campaigns-this-assembly-poll/articleshow/115124559.cms,"In a first-of-its-kind campaign, social media lit up with cinematic AI-powered election ads from Maharashtra's deputy CM Ajit Pawar that racked up thousands of views and plenty of chatter.In one video, a young girl in a village takes a break from household chores under a tree when a newspaper lands on her lap with a headline promising free education for girls from modest backgrounds, with Pawar's face beside the headline. In a flash, she is in a crisp school uniform, pedalling off to class. Another ad depicts an anxious mother as her cooking gas flickers out with hungry kids waiting until a billboard outside catches her eye, promising three free gas cylinders each year. Both videos close with Pawar's reassuring voice: ""Your brother always keeps his word,"" followed by a call to vote for NCP 's clock symbol.The response to these AI-generated scenes and characters has been split - some praised it as ""bold and historic,"" while others joked it felt ""like a cartoon"". Either way, tech is clearly front and centre this election season, with political parties pulling out all kinds of tech tricks - AI-powered characters, hyper-personalised messages, tap cards, QR codes, and podcasts-to shape their campaign playbook.NCP insiders say that the use of AI marks a shift towards a ""data-driven"" approach that resonates particularly well with younger voters and grabs eyeballs. ""AI has helped simplify complex processes and saved us a lot of time,"" a party source says, adding that promotional audiovisual material that once required multiple tools-voiceover artistes, animation, camera work, and graphics-are now tackled at one go.BJP, on the other hand, is keeping AI at arm's length, using faces and voices of ""real benefactors that we've interviewed over the last two years"", says Sujay Patki , spokesperson for BJP Maharashtra, about opting out of the AI frenzy. ""Yes, it cuts costs, but AI-generated content can be unconvincing for the public and tends to create disbelief-no real people, no actual beneficiaries,"" says Patki , recalling the backlash BJP faced in Madhya Pradesh when AI imagery was used in their 'Ladki Bahin' campaign duringLok Sabha elections. ""People asked why AI was needed if the schemes genuinely benefited real girls and women. At times, we hesitate to use actual photos over concern about misrepresentation. But creating disbelief is worse,"" he says.NCP, however, insists that AI has stepped up its personal touch, and besides the videos, they are also harnessing it to create hyper-personalised messages that greet voters by name. ""We're collecting details like names and ages from households during door-to-door campaigns. Once this data is fed into the system, AI generates tailor-made messages that reach voters directly via WhatsApp or automated calls with Ajit-dada addressing people while delivering a message for a personal touch,"" explains a party insider.The risk, Patki says, is that AI's ""picture-perfect"" visuals often feel staged, out of sync with reality. ""The colours, the voices-all create a false impression that regular people can't connect with,"" he argues. However, NCP insists AI is less about showing off tech and more about connecting with people in a whole new way. ""One of our AI-created videos featuring Dada at Ganpati Visarjan got over a million views in no time. It's new, it's different, and it's getting people talking.""To stand out in a media landscape saturated with flashy visuals and speeches, BJP has decided to turn to podcasts and 'tap cards' as fresh tools. Launched on Monday, its new podcast series 'Nakki Kay Challay?' (what exactly is happening?) hosted by senior leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe , is adding heft to its poll campaign. Each 30-minute episode-which breaks down key issues like rural development, agriculture, and women's empowerment with party leaders and subject experts-has been trimmed to bite-sized shareable clips for quick scrolls on social media.The lineup includes legal heavyweight Ujjwal Nikam, who in his segment recalls former CM and current deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis' role in securing David Headley's deposition before the Indian court. The podcasts will also feature Marathi writer Sadananda More, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry founder Milind Kamble, rural development expert Popat Pawar, Pasha Patel, a farmer leader and MLA who's been vocal about agricultural issues, and party faces like Smriti Irani and Fadnavis. Shiv Sena (UBT), too, is banking on the power of podcasts, a tactic that has served it well, and is in talks with Aaditya Thackeray to plan upcoming episodes. ""Podcasts worked really well for us for last Lok Sabha campaign,"" says a party insider. ""They let us dive deeper into issues and reach audiences in a way that feels more engaging and conversational.""Meanwhile, BJP has rolled out NFC-enabled tap cards as part of its door-to-door strategy, for an interactive twist. A quick smartphone tap on the card leads to a webpage where citzens can submit ideas for the party's manifesto. ""Available in English and Marathi, this lets voters feel heard and also helps the party track trends in the state to shape its policies,"" explains Vinay Punamiya, who heads IT and social media for BJP's youth wing in the state. The card isn't a one-off either. After the manifesto phase, it will be reprogrammed with fresh updates so that the voter connection doesn't end after polling day.Taking personalisation further, Shiv Sena (UBT) candidates are now using AI tools to create customised video messages that allow candidates to speak to people directly, says Sainath Durge , the party's secretary, adding that their newly launched 'pocket manifesto'-a mini, QR-coded handout-is another tech tool in their arsenal that candidates and party workers are carrying.Not to be left out, NCP too has added QR codes to its manifesto, allowing voters to scan and instantly access Pawar's manifesto, social media channels, and other updates. ""Even our vans are QR-coded-one scan and voters are in.""","NCP is using AI to create hyper-personalised messages that greet voters by name.

Netas like Yogi Adityanath brought in to sow discord: Sharad Pawar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/netas-like-yogi-adityanath-brought-in-to-sow-discord-sharad-pawar/articleshow/115124416.cms,"Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: NCP (SCP) chief Sharad Pawar , addressing a series of rallies on Saturday, accused BJP of indulging in divisive politics and, without naming agriculture minister Dhananjay Munde , counted him among three people responsible for the split in NCP.Pawar addressed rallies in Latur's Udgir, and Beed's Parli and Ashti constituencies on Saturday. Earlier in the day, Pawar spoke to reporters in Nanded. Reacting to the ""Batenge to Katenge"" slogan, Sharad Pawar said: ""Elections come and go, but no one should sow seeds of discord between castes and religions. Unfortunately, BJP and its allies are indifferent to this responsibility."" He said politicians like Yogi Adityanath are brought in to campiagn in Maharashtra specifically for communal polarisation.""Sharad Pawar also spoke about the internal disruptions in NCP and stated that three individuals fuelled mistrust and weakened the party. ""There were two or three key figures who worked to sow the seeds of division and undermine trust within the party and the community. Those who split the party must be defeated in the upcoming elections,"" he told the audience at the Parli rally and urged voters to elect Rajesaheb Deshmukh. Parli is represented by Munde.In Nanded, he criticised BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Chavan, accusing him of aligning with opposition ideologies for political expediency. ""The Chavan family has held prominent positions in Congress - from chief minister to defence minister. What more could be offered? People are aware of these opportunistic moves and will respond accordingly,"" he said. Pawar drew a contrast with Shankarrao Chavan, who maintained his commitment to Congress principles even when establishing a separate faction.In Udgir, Pawar highlighted the deteriorating condition of farmers under current govt. ""For the past 10-12 years, Narendra Modi govt has been in place, yet farmers' condition has worsened. Despite efforts to become self-sufficient, especially in agricultural processing industries, current govt's policies have undone much of that progress."" Pawar lauded late Vilasrao Deshmukh for fostering industry in Latur, emphasizing that balanced growth in both agriculture and manufacturing was essential.In Parli, Pawar's speech was particularly sharp. Speaking at a rally for NCP candidate Rajesaheb Deshmukh, he said, ""It has been some time since I last visited Parli. Recently, lawlessness and 'gundagiri' have increased here. Beed once supported all our MLAs, but power has gone to the heads of certain individuals too quickly, leading to hardship for the people. This must stop."" He added, ""When power is acquired, it must be wielded responsibly and with humility. Some have lost sight of that.""In Ashti, Pawar turned his focus to youth unemployment while rallying support for party candidate Mahboob Shaikh, the state youth president of NCP (SCP). ""Unemployment has forced Beed's youths to migrate for work in MIDCs across Maharashtra,"" he said, criticising PM Modi's govt for failing to fulfil employment promises. Pawar urged voters to support the MVA coalition to facilitate job creation and local growth.","Sharad Pawar addressed rallies in Latur's Udgir, and Beed's Parli and Ashti constituencies on Saturday.

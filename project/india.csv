‘Don’t lower the age. Just stop jailing adolescent love’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-lower-the-age-just-stop-jailing-adolescent-love/articleshow/122915762.cms,"With the Supreme Court weighing in, a growing chorus of experts is calling for decriminalising consensual relationships even if the age of consent is not lowered

New Delhi :

TOI

With the Supreme Court hearing a pivotal case over whether to lower the statutory age of consent for sexual activity from 18 to 16 years, activists and experts working with children or dealing with cases that fall in the domain of “consensual romantic relationships” bring into focus the various complexities and challenges the situation presents in courts and beyond for “adolescents”.At one end is a strong view that highlights the plight of boys and girls caught in such cases — putting their dignity, liberty and right to protection as teenagers at stake. On the other end are activists, who caution that attempts to change the age of consent could present a situation that could lead to misuse and enable child marriage in the garb of “romantic relationships”.In the case before SC, for instance, senior advocate and amicus curiae Indira Jaising has urged the court to read down the current legal threshold of 18, arguing that the existing provisions criminalise consensual adolescent relationships and infringe on constitutional rights.On the other hand, the Union govt has insisted that the age must remain 18 to safeguard minors from exploitation, warning that bringing down the age could undermine the country’s child protection framework.An attempt to address the complexities was also made by the Law Commission in its report on the issue in 2023. It had advised against lowering the age of consent from 18 years. It also suggested amendments in the Pocso Act to introduce guided judicial discretion by the special court in the matter of deciding on sentencing in cases involving “tacit approval” of minors between 16 and 18 years old.Swagata Raha, the founder of Enfold, a child rights NGO, has repeated her demand to decriminalise sexual relationships deemed “consensual” — by creating an exception in Pocso for those aged between 16 and 18. “We are not saying that the age of consent needs to be brought down to 16,” she told. “The current provision under Pocso, which sets the age of consent at 18, presents a situation where a romantic consensual relationship between adolescents is treated as a criminal act, on a par with sexual exploitation and rape. This is clearly damaging, and has long-term impact on the life and dignity of young people. To restore balance in law, this needs to change through the introduction of exceptions recognising consent of those above 16 years. ” At least one in four cases criminalised under Pocso is “romantic” in nature, she said, citing empirical studies based on judgments.On the other hand, Bhuwan Ribhu, founder of Just Rights for Children, warned that lowering consent will open a Pandora’s box, legitimising various forms of child rape as well as trafficking and child marriage. “The law is being misunderstood and misinterpreted in the so-called consent debate,” he said, adding, “No amendment to Pocso should be made until the current law is implemented in letter and spirit. With less than 10% conviction rate and compensation awarded in fewer than 1% of cases, the need of the hour is to implement the law before we amend it. ”Ribhu suggested that in “genuine cases” of romantic consensual relationships, with appropriate checks and balances, it was possible to ensure protection without tinkering with consent. He felt Pocso could be amended to decriminalise situations, say, where there is a history of a romantic relationship between a boy and a girl and where the latter has been consistent in her statements before child protection agencies and courts, and where there is no gang rape or prior criminal history.However, child justice and criminal lawyer Anant Asthana feels that the issue can be addressed through amendments to Pocso — to create room for judges to exercise discretion with necessary checks to protect genuine cases of romantic relationships. Drawing attention to the lack of child-friendly policing, he highlighted the need to first equip police with a protocol to deal with such cases to protect the identity of the boy and girl.Advocate and founder of Independent Thought, Vikram Srivastava, said any attempt to alter the age of consent would open the doors to misuse and increase the risk of child marriage in the garb of consent, by the parents themselves, as seen in many states. “Among socalled consensual relationships, in most cases we find they are entangled in a series of illegalities leading to elopement. Even for ‘genuine consensual relationships’, checks and procedural safeguards must be provided to filter genuine cases,” he said.Putting across the perspective of adolescents affected by such cases, Sonal Kapoor from Protsahan, which works with child survivors of abuse, said that blanket criminalisation of consensual adolescent relationships under Pocso, even when non-exploitative and rooted in mutual consent, stripped young people of voice, choice and agency.“Lowering the age of consent risks weakening protections against coercion. But keeping it rigid results in young couples being dragged through criminal trials, humiliated and dehumanised by the same laws that are meant to protect them,” she said. “The law must evolve. It must hold space for both protection of children and autonomy of young people.”",The Supreme Court is hearing a case over whether to lower the statutory age of consent for sexual activity from 18 to 16 years. Activists and experts working with children or dealing with cases that fall in the domain of “consensual romantic relationships’ are calling for decriminalising consensual relationships even if the age is not lowered.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122915742,imgsize-161204,width-400,resizemode-4/122915742.jpg"

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Valluvar, in his timeless brevity, rarely defines wealth virtue, education or honour. His genius lies in resisting rigid definitions, knowing that time may also dissolve what it defines. Yet when it comes to conduct, he commands.This couplet, recited in every Tamil classroom, does not describe(propriety), but insists on it. A man without conduct, he says, does not merely lose face—he tumbles into a disgrace so deep; no praise or privilege can pull him out.Centuries later, in the dazzling chaos of a Coldplay concert, we saw how quick a fall can be.Andy Byron, CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, the company’s HR head, were caught on a kiss cam—sixteen seconds of intimacy, followed by awkward attempts to dodge the spotlight. Kristin turns her face away, Andy ducks awkwardly.But the world had already seen them.Chris Martin of Coldplay, unaware of the stakes, quipped, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” By the time the music ended, the footage had gone viral—not because it showed two anonymous lovers, but because both were married.The fallout was swift. Andy resigned and Kristin was placed on indefinite leave. Andy’s wife dropped his surname. Two families unravelled. The company reeled. One hug—perhaps careless—brought down reputations, disrupted careers, and scorched the moral standing of those expected to uphold company values.Too often, heroes fall, not because the world watches, but because they stop watching themselves. Power creates a dangerous illusion—that authority grants exemption from the very rules one promotes. Fame seduces. Influence dulls the inner compass. The higher the pedestal, the greater the fall—especially when leaders forget that respect is earned not by speeches, but by silent choices.Leadership without integrity is mere performance. In an age of billion-dollar companies and fast-moving technology,. Especially those made in the quiet moments where no audience claps.Byron’s story now joins the long list of fallen icons. Not because he erred, but because he mistook position for permission.I am reminded of the Tamil film, one of K Balachander’s finest. In the film, JKB, a married man and a celebrated singer, has an affair with Sindhu, his admirer. After much turmoil and soul-searching, his family agrees to a second marriage. But Sindhu walks away. Her reason — she does not want to become the precedent for moral compromise. If a great artist like JKB bends the code of public probity, she fears others will use him as a license to do the same.She chooses obscurity over validation.The film’s climax, like Valluvar’s couplet, is a mediation on the burden of those in the public eye. Fame, power, and influence are not shields—they are mirrors that magnify every flaw.When conduct fails, greatness does not fall with drama—it crumbles in disgrace. And no amount of apology, wealth, or digital spin can rebuild what the soul has forsaken.From the sands of two millennia, Valluvar’s voice still rises:It is not brilliance, success, or charm that makes a person noble.It is—the unseen thread of morality that holds everything together.Once that thread breaks, everything else unravels. Even ‘all the king’s horses and all the king’s men’cannot put it back together again.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122886781,imgsize-56844,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/122886781.jpg"

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll How impressed are you by Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Extremely impressed Somewhat impressed Not very impressed

Around 11 am local time, Rishabh Pant arrived at Old Trafford cricket ground with his injured right foot protected and secured inside a moonboot. He used a crutch for support and slowly made his way to the away dressing room. In lightning quick time, the wicketkeeper-batter changed to the Indian whites and was captured in the balcony behind head coach Gautam Gambhir He had not accompanied the rest of the team in the bus to the ground and it was later revealed by Shardul Thakur that an early hospital visit forced him to arrive nearly two hours later. The visuals of Day 1 were still fresh in everyone's mind and it was difficult to even entertain the outrageous thought of Pant coming out to bat in that condition. The swelling, the bleeding and the inability to put the injured foot down made it impossible to imagine the 27-year-old walking down the staircase from the dressing room to the ground.All heads panned towards the steps when Shardul Thakur was dismissed and the capacity crowd was up on its feet when they saw Pant hobble out to the middle. The scoreboard, the situation of the match and cricket took a backseat because what was unfolding in front of everyone was an exhibition of grit, courage and the desire to contribute for the team.There was a sense of shock in the opposite camp too because they didn't expect Pant to play any part in the Test and him walking out did catch them a bit off guard.He stretched his overnight score of 37 to 54, hit a six off Jofra Archer, limped for singles and gave another example of why impossible is ‘I'm possible’ in Pant's dictionary. If batting with a painful finger at Lord's wasn't enough, the left-hander took it to a different level by batting with a fractured toe. An injury which required him to rest for at least six weeks but all that took a backseat as Pant wanted to score those crucial runs lower down the order.Multiple trips to the hospital and the hours put in by the medical team kept the plan of keeping him ready to bat in place, and there was a lot of excitement in the dressing room. They were aware of the seriousness of the injury but knew the grit would take over.""Everyone was very excited to see how he would approach his innings. And I think what he showed today, the passion he showed for the team is unmatched. We have seen a lot of instances in the past where he has batted in fractures. I think there was a time when Graeme Smith was batting in the South African team. His hand was fractured.""So, in these moments, the grit of the player comes into play. And I think Rishabh's positivity and his grit keeps him away from all the pains and whatever pain he has. His pain bearing capacity is very high. If he is in pain, it is a big injury,"" said Shardul Thakur in the post-day presser.With Pant, it has been the case of grit over matter and will not be a surprise if it remains that way in the second innings too. There is no official word on his participation in the last Test but it is very unlikely.Manchester, however, could see another glimpse of the freak who dances to his own tunes. If the situation demands and the team needs, the crutches will be ditched, the moonboot will come off and he will descend those steps again to give his all for the team. Possibly one last time in the series.",Rishabh Pant came out to bat with a fractured toe on Day 1 of the second Test. The wicketkeeper-batter scored 54 not out and hit a six off Jofra Archer. The 27-year-old is expected to be out for at least six weeks with the injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894641,imgsize-90074,width-400,resizemode-4/122894641.jpg"

There is no greater example I think than what we did in Operation Sindoor. Less than 50 weapons can bring the adversary to the talking table...that is an example that needs to be studied and will be studied (by scholars),"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, speaking at an interactive session during an aerospace power seminar here.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, in turn, said the armed forces need to maintain ""very high"" operational readiness round-the-clock and throughout the year because Operation Sindoor ""still continues"", while stressing that ""there are no runners-up in war"".Noting that the rapid advances in technology and the ongoing geopolitical churn have ushered in ""a third revolution in warfare"", the CDS said the Indian military needs ""information warriors, technology warriors and scholar warriors"" geared for multi-domain operations. It is essential for the military to learn both 'shastra' (warfare/weapons) and 'shaastra' (knowledge), he said.Though Air Marshal Tiwari did not specify the weapons that were used during the May 7-10 hostilities, IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structuresThe IAF vice chief also said manned systems like fighters ""still have a huge advantage"" over unmanned systems like drones, in terms of the ""compellence"" and ""coercive diplomacy"" to be imposed on an adversary, and will continue to do so for some time.""We are giving too much importance to unmanned systems. While they have a place and relevance in modern warfare, but the kind of weight of attack, the intelligence required, the kind of damage they can cause...You have to see whether they balance with what manned aerial systems bring to the table,"" he said.Different speakers at the ""Capstone"" seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies and College of Air Warfare stressed the need for India to ""prioritise"" the development of aerospace power, which was ""not escalatory"" but ""a strategic and effective tool for escalation control"" as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor. ""Operation Sindoor underlined the speed, reach and flexibility of airpower. We established escalation dominance over Pakistan,"" said a speaker.Others pointed out that India had drawn a new red line for Pakistan by stressing it will not be dissuaded by the western adversary's nuclear blackmail and continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks in the future as well.","Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha.

(With inputs from agencies)

KOLKATA: West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose has returned the Aparajita bill to the Assembly for reconsideration, citing serious objections raised by the Centre regarding proposed changes to Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), according to a high-ranking Raj Bhavan source.The Centre found that the Aparajita Women and Child (West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, passed in Sept 2024, contains changes in penal provisions for rape under multiple BNS sections, proposing ""excessively harsh and disproportionate"" punishments, sources said.A major point of contention is an amendment to BNS section 64. The state bill increases the punishment for rape from the current minimum of 10 years to either imprisonment for the remainder of the convict's natural life or capital punishment. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) reportedly deemed this as unduly harsh and inconsistent with principles of proportionality.Another change that MHA has objected to involves the removal of BNS section 65, which prescribes stricter penalties for sexual assault of minors. According to sources, Union govt believe scrapping this clause weakens protections for the vulnerable groups and risks diluting the intent behind age-based classifications in rape laws.However, the clause that the Centre found most problematic is the one under section 66, making the death penalty mandatory in rape cases where the victim either dies or is left in a vegetative state.The MHA raised constitutional concerns, arguing that removing judicial discretion in sentencing violated established legal norms and Supreme Court rulings, sources said.State govt, however, said it had received no official communication either from the Centre nor the governor's office about these observations.Earlier, bills similar to Aparajita, like Andhra Pradesh Disha Bill, 2019, and Maharashtra Shakti Bill, 2020 - which had mandatory death penalty for all rape and gang-rape cases - were passed unanimously by state legislatures, but did not get President's assent.Trinamool Congress indicated the party would make it a political issue. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: ""The returning of the Aparajita bill is unfortunate, deplorable and condemnable... This has proved that BJP is unwilling to impose maximum punishment in these cases, as their members are implicated in molestations and rapes.""",West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose has returned the Aparajita bill to the Assembly for reconsideration.

New Delhi/Mumbai: Consumer affairs department on Friday suggested e-commerce companies explore including a new filter feature of ""country of origin"" on their websites and mobile apps for products, which will help consumers make quick choices. E-commerce platforms would have to create a new filter having a drop down menu of countries, allowing consumers to make their choice as per their preference.At present, companies display the country of origin of items under the product description option and to check this, buyers need to go through the entire information of each product, which is more time taking. ""Many of the e-commerce platforms have filters on their sites and apps such as price range, brand, type of product and different sizes. So, adding another filter on country of origin is very much feasible and that will help consumers to find items of their choice based on their country of origin quickly. This will bring customer satisfaction,"" said an official.The department held a video conference with industry players and other stakeholders on Friday for amending the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules for country of origin-based filters on their platforms.""There was almost a consensus among the participants, including from major ecommerce firms, and they said this would need change in the algorithm to create this new filter feature. We will hold more deliberations with the stakeholders,"" said an official. Sources said earlier the e-commerce firms smoothly complied with the Legal Metrology Rules for labeling packaged commodities.Industry sources said the meeting was more of an exploratory one where the idea was to understand the feasibility of getting the added filter within apps and platforms. They added that officials wanted to understand the constraints of companies if they were to create such a feature. ""For marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra, it would be more of a tech related issue, which can be solved. But for companies which hold inventory, there may be an added compliance burden,"" one of them said.Another e-commerce executive, however, said that given the limited space on mobile phones, adding another filter could be a constraint. ""It could be quite draining for the industry. And the expectation of the ministry is to get it done before the festive season if it gets implemented,"" he said.Satish Meena, adviser at market research firm Datum Intelligence, said if this is implemented, customers will be able to filter out products based on their country of origin which means that some brands on these platforms could lose visibility. ""Until now, not many consumers paid so much attention to a product's country of origin. But overall, it shouldn't be a very big challenge for platforms,"" he added. For quick commerce platforms, food and grocery accounts for a major part of their coverage as of now and most of them are sourced from India anyway. A very small part of their inventory comes from out of India currently, added Meena.","Consumer affairs department suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites.

You both must make an effort to restore ties: SC to couple

NEW DELHI: In a joint family, a man giving more importance to his mother than his wife is often a trigger for discord. But for amicable resolution of disputes, the apex court Friday advised one such man to hear out his wife's view and respect her sentiments too.Though the couple in question, now living separately, hinted that there was no possibility of their living together, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan asked them to sort out their differences through mediation and give a fresh try to their relationship for the sake of their two children - a minor son living with his mother and an elder daughter living with her grandmother as the father is in the US.""Take back your wife and children. Be a responsible father. Both of you must make an effort to restore your relationship,"" the bench told the couple, both of whom were present in court through video conferencing.As the woman and her husband kept blaming each other - the man alleging that a false criminal case was lodged against him and the woman claiming that she was not being taken care of - the bench said they should focus on the interests of the children instead of fighting it out.When the man kept referring to his mother during the hearing, Justice Nagarathna hinted that many family disputes arose when the wife is not given her due importance.""Mother's words are considered weightier than wife's and that creates a problem. Grow up. We are not telling you to keep your mother aside but talk to your wife also,"" the bench told the manAs the husband submitted that he had not seen his son even once since the child was living with his mom, the court immediately asked her to bring the child in front of the camera but she said that he had gone to school. The court then directed her to show the child to his father during mediation. ""Imagine a child who had not seen his father and sister. Do not do this.

Dhankhar had accepted the motion signed by 63 opposition members against Justice Yashwant Varma despite the decision at all-party meeting on Sunday that process for the removal of the judge should begin in the LS.Dhankhar's action of accepting opposition's notice is said to have set in motion a chain of events, murmurs of a ""secret deal"" and, crucially, a move by BJP-led coalition to signal their loss of trust in the Chairman, leading to his surprise exist on ""health grounds"".Rijiju reiterated Friday that there was a unanimous decision of all political parties to move for the removal of Varma, asserting that the Lok Sabha will take up the motion.The minister said all political parties had agreed that the removal of Justice Varma should be a joint call, adding that the proceedings will be taken up in the Lok Sabha and then moved to the Rajya Sabha, in line with the Judges (Inquiry) Act.

KOTA/JAIPUR: Seven children were killed and at least 21 injured when a classroom ceiling collapsed on them at Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district on Friday morning, moments after a teacher who had been alerted to ""falling brick pieces"" allegedly asked them to ""sit quietly"". Ten of the injured students were hospitalised in a critical condition, officials said.Principal Meena Garg and four teachers were suspended for alleged negligence pending a high-level probe while school education minister Madan Dilawar owned moral responsibility for the tragedy.""I won't engage in a blame game. Being the education minister, I am responsible for this... We will conduct a fair investigation and strict action will be taken against those found guilty. We allocated funds for the maintenance of 2,000 dilapidated govt schools in phases,"" Dilawar said.He announced Rs 10 lakh in ex gratia and a contractual govt job for one family member of each of the victims.Outrage over the ceiling collapse triggered violence in Jhalawar later in the day, prompting police to baton charge groups of protesters blocking roads and pelting them with stones at Guradi Circle and outside SRG Hospital.The victims, between 10 and 15, were among 31 students of different classes inside the classroom when cracks in the ceiling suspected to have been caused by rainwater seepage purportedly opened up before their eyes. ""We told sir that pieces of the ceiling were falling on us but he ignored it,"" said a teary-eyed girl.Within seconds, screams of children drowned in the noise of brick and mortar coming down in a heap. Villagers who had sprinted towards the school compound on seeing clouds of dust spiralling into the air were the first rescuers, sources said.Witnesses said parents frantically searched for their children in the mounds of debris. ""At least 13 kids were pulled out within 20 minutes of the ceiling collapse,"" said village sarpanch Ram Prasad Lodha, who drove his payloader to the site to assist in the rescue.Lodha alleged that an ambulance reached the village 45 minutes after being informed of the accident. Most of the injured students were taken to hospital on motorcycles, he said.While the education minister's office said 21 students were injured, Jhalawar district education officer Narso Meena's official report mentions injuries to 24 people.Preliminary reports suggested the students had been made to wait in their classrooms instead of going to the ground for morning prayers, as usual, because it was raining at the time. The classroom's rear wall collapsed first, causing the roof to fall on the students.The classroom whose ceiling collapsed was one of two built in 1994 with funds from the gram panchayat. ""Funds were released recently for repairs. We aren't sure if the rooms built by the gram panchayat were renovated or not,"" said an official.Collector Rathore said district administration recently instructed education department to draw up a list of dilapidated school buildings. Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School, whose building is three decades old, didn't figure in that list, he said.Education secretary Krishna Kunal said the school's roof had been repaired in 2023. ""If a little caution were exercised, such a tragedy wouldn't have occurred. We are appealing not only to teachers but also to parents and village representatives that children should not be sent to schools with dilapidated rooms.""","Rains had forced kids to remain indoors at Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district.

NEW DELHI: Observing that the very soul of education stands distorted with students being forced into a rat race and subjected to relentless psychological pressure resulting in increasing number of suicide cases, Supreme Court directed all educational institutions, including coaching centres, to ensure mental health safeguards.The court passed a slew of directions to institutions, including appointing counsellors or psychologists, avoiding batch segregation based on academic performance and mandatorily training staff twice a year by certified mental health professionals.Lamenting the degradation of the education system to a high-stakes race with narrowly defined goals of achievement, status and economic security, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that a system has to put in place to protect the life of students who take the extreme step due to various reasons.""The joy of learning has been replaced by anxiety over rankings, results and relentless performance metrics. Students, especially those preparing for competitive examinations, are often caught in a web that rewards conformity over curiosity, output over understanding, and endurance over well-being,"" said Justice Mehta, who penned the judgement for the bench, emphasising that multi-sectoral approach towards suicide prevention with a specific focus on youth was needed.It said education is meant to liberate, not burden the learner, and that its true success lies not in grades or rankings but in the holistic growth of a human being capable of living with dignity, confidence and purpose.The court passed the order on a plea filed by parents of a medical aspirant who committed suicide and ordered a CBI probe in the case after noting loopholes in investigations done by Andhra Pradesh police.The apex court said continued loss of young lives due to unattended psychological distress, academic overburden and institutional insensitivity reflect a systemic failure that cannot be ignored.It directed states and UTs to notify rules within two months mandating registration, student protection norms, and grievance redressal mechanisms for all private coaching centres. As per NCRB, India recorded 1,70,924 reported suicide cases in 2022 of which 7.6%, approx 13,044, were student suicides. Notably, 2,248 of these deaths were attributed directly to failure in exams. As per NCRB data, the number of suicides among students in the last two decades has increased from 5,425 in 2001 to 13,044 in 2022.""In recent past, reports have emerged of student suicides in premier institutions and, particularly, coaching centres, pointing to a pattern of despair that demands collective introspection. These young individuals, often far away from home, isolated in demanding academic environments, find themselves without adequate emotional or institutional support. The culture of silence around mental health exacerbates their vulnerability. The gravity of this crisis cannot be overstated, and any incident involving the death of a student under such circumstances warrants the utmost seriousness, not just as an isolated tragedy but as part of a larger systemic malaise that threatens the future of the young generation,"" SC said.","Supreme Court orders all educational institutions, including coaching centres, to ensure mental health safeguards.

PM Modi is expected to speak in both the Houses.

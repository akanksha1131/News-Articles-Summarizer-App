saptha pathi

Thirukkural

Book of Ethics

Book of Wealth

Book of Love

Those who have virtuous children, that none reproach, can escape from the touch of evil in the maze of seven births

Friends who wiped our tears will be fondly remembered all through our seven births.

One generation blessed with learning will benefit seven generations to come.

He who avoids deeds praised by the wise will be despised in seven births.

A fool may, in a single birth, create a hell he must endure for seven births.

He left only yesterday, yet it feels as if seven days have passed.

Thankkuvamai illadhaan thaal serndharkku allaal

Manakkavalai matral aridhu.

Unless you surrender to His feet, to whom none compare,

No anxiety of the mind can be removed.

There are numbers we count with, and then there are numbers we live with.The number seven belongs to the latter.It hums quietly in the background — seven swaras that shape every melody, seven colours of a rainbow, seven days that cradle a week. It shapes the wonders we marvel at, the seas we dream of crossing, and even the bones that hold our heads high.In Tirupati, the Lord resides on seven hills. In Christianity, the divine trinity and earthly elements together add upto seven. In Islam, pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times. In Hindu weddings, seven steps —— bind the two souls for life. Even in unseen realms, there are seven heavens above and seven worlds below.Did Valluvar , too, feel the pull of this number? Seven is hidden, almost like a secret signature, in the very architecture of the. Each couplet is made up of exactly seven words. The epic itself has 133 chapters. 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. Total couplets: 1,330. Again, 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7.The three divisions of the Kural whisper the same pattern.: 34 chapters. 3 + 4 = 7.: 70 chapters. 7 + 0 = 7.: 25 chapters. 2 + 5 = 7.This was no accident. Valluvar’s structure was his shield. In an age when poems were easily interpolated, he made sure no stray verse could slip into his work without disturbing the harmony of his sevens.Kural 62:Kural 107:Kural 398:Kural 538:Kural 835:And then there is the tender ache of separation. Kural 1269 and 1278 speak of a woman waiting for her lover:My favourite is the seventh couplet itself:Life is fragile. Nature rages, wars scar the earth, grief stalks the living, and we stumble, uncertain of our script. And yet, there is one moment of clarity: the moment of surrender.For in surrender, the burden shifts. I place my anxieties in His keeping and find myself free.Who am I, but a drop in the ocean of His kindness? And yet — a drop that belongs. Perhaps that is the true secret of seven: not that it completes the count, but that it reminds us we are already whole.The wheel turns again.Seven births, seven days, seven colours, seven notes;each cycle returning us to where we began, reminding us that wholeness is not reached at the end of the journey, but in every step along the circle of seven.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

'Atom Bomb Hay, Fatega': Rahul Gandhi Warns EC Over Bihar SIR, Oppn Demand Parliament Showdown

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday said it prefers to ignore Rahul Gandhi 's baseless allegations of ""vote theft"" and has asked all poll officials to continue working in an impartial and transparent manner, unfazed by his repeated threats and ""deplorable"" statements.In a post on X, the commission said it was unfortunate that Rahul was hurling unfounded allegations at EC and poll officials and repeatedly threatening them through media statements with irresponsible phrases like 'vote chori', ""over a year after conclusion of the Lok Sabha poll"".He said neither Rahul nor Congress availed of options available under the law, such as appeals against wrongful inclusion or exclusion of electors by the ERO in the final roll or challenging an election by filing an election petition within the stipulated time (45 days after declaration of result).EC said that it had sent a mail to Rahul Gandhi on June 12 after he alleged irregularities in Maharashtra polls, in a newspaper article. He was asked to write to the EC directly or meet the panel, but he did not respond. Interestingly, none of the allegations made by Rahul in his article, or any other grievance of his, has been directly communicated to EC. ""It is very strange and deplorable that he is making wild allegations and has now even started threatening EC and its staff,"" EC said.In the post on X, the commission underlined that while Rahul Gandhi has been attacking EC over alleged ""vote theft"" during the Lok Sabha poll in Karnataka, the fact is that the electoral roll was prepared by 31 district election officers, 419 electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant EROs and 58,834 booth level officers (BLOs), with the due involvement of booth level agents appointed by all political parties.","The Election Commission (EC) on Friday said it prefers to ignore Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations of ""vote theft"" The commission said it was unfortunate that Rahul was hurling unfounded allegations at EC and poll officials.

Surge in Deportations: 8 Indians Deported Daily from the US Under Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-deportations-from-us-double-after-trump-returns-to-office/articleshow/123052105.cms,"File photo

Humane deportation



90% from 5 states



BENGALURU: That deportations of Indians from the US have surged significantly since Donald Trump returned to office in Jan this year is no secret. Now here’s how much more it is when compared to the Biden term and the last year of Trump’s previous term that preceded it: On average, at least 8 Indians were sent back everyday this year, compared to around 3 daily between Jan 2020 and Dec 2024.According to data from the ministry of external affairs (MEA), in the five-and-a-half years between Jan 2020 and July 2025, 7,244 Indians were deported for various reasons, and nearly a quarter of them — 1,703 — were sent back after Trump took office for the second time.This rise also coincides with more aggressive enforcement mechanisms. On June 26, the US state department reminded people that the visa screening doesn’t stop after a visa is issued. “...We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules — and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t.”While this was for legal immigrants, a couple of days before this statement, the US had said: “The US has increased enforcement of immigration laws and removal of illegal aliens. Illegal entry will lead to detention, deportation, and permanent consequences for future visa eligibility…Embarking on a costly and dangerous journey will land you in jail or back in your homeland with a permanent mark on your record.”Of the 1,703 deported this year, 864 deportations occurred through state-arranged charter and military flights, as per MEA. US Customs and Border Protection (military flights) repatriated 333 people across three dates in Feb: 5, 15, and 16. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), through its Enforcement and Removal Operations, deported a total of 231 individuals via chartered flights on March 19, June 8, and June 25. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also carried out deportations via charter flights, sending 300 people back to India on July 5 and 18.W hile 747 individuals were deported via commercial flights from the US — they arrived individually or in small groups, depending on when their flight tickets were arranged — another 72 individuals came through commercial flights from Panama in a similar staggered manner.India doesn’t maintain its own firm estimates of illegal immigration into the US. And so far as consular and deportation exercises are concerned, it relies on information shared by US authorities.The MEA has said that “it remains engaged with US counterparts to ensure deportations are carried out humanely. It has also raised concerns regarding the reported use of shackles, particularly on women and children, and other issues related to cultural and religious sensitivities.”Further, a state-wise analysis of the 1,703 Indian deportations in 2025 so far shows that the trend is heavily skewed towards a few northern states. Punjab topped the list with 620 deportees, closely followed by Haryana with 604 — together accounting for over 70% of all cases.Gujarat was a distant third, with 245 individuals sent back, while Uttar Pradesh and Goa followed with 38 and 26 deportees respectively. These top five states collectively represent more than 90% of all deportations recorded this year.The remaining states and UTs reported far fewer cases. Maharashtra and Delhi had 20 deportees each, Telangana 19, Tamil Nadu 17, and Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand 12 each. Karnataka saw only 5.","In five-and-a-half years between Jan 2020 and July 2025, 7,244 Indians were deported for various reasons.

NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi Friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that EC is helping BJP steal votes, stepping up his attack on ""vote chori"" on a day he led the joint opposition in writing to Lok Sabha Speaker demanding an immediate discussion on the review of electoral rolls in Bihar. The opposition told Speaker that the issue has a direct bearing on the ""right to vote"" and ""conduct of free and fair elections"", and merits an urgent debate.Talking about Congress' probe, likely about voters' list for Bangalore Rural LS seat, Rahul told reporters, ""What we found is atom bomb; I mean EC will be blown away when that atom bomb explodes"". The opposition's letter to Om Birla - signed by Congress, DMK, NCP-SP, RSP, SS-UBT, SP, TMC and RJD - expressed serious concern over the Bihar poll roll revision being done just before elections. It said EC has also announced the exercise will be done nationally, despite apprehensions about ""transparency, timing and intent of process"".The letter said the opposition had on several occasions listed a discussion on SIR as a priority, but the Modi govt has not notified a date yet.As he doubled down on his allegations, Rahul warned that officials involved in the ""theft"" will not be spared. ""...because you are working against India, which is treason.Remember, wherever you are, whether retired or whatever, we will find you,"" he said. Rahul argued that Congress had suspicions after assembly polls in MP, which solidified after LS polls, and were further deepened with Maharashtra contest last year. Since EC was not helping with voters' lists, the party conducted its own deep dive into voters data.Meanwhile, BJP Friday took a swipe at Rahul's ""atom bomb"" claim, asking him to ""flow like water"" instead of ""exploding like a bomb"". ""If they explode a bomb, we will save Constitution,"" said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. He said the Opposition speaks of such things because they have no faith in democracy.","Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi Friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that EC is helping BJP steal votes.

NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over the deleterious impact of addictive betting applications on youth, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond in two weeks what steps it is contemplating to save youngsters from getting financially ruined, often forcing them to commit suicide.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the counsel for Centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating after applying mind to the gravity of the issue"".The counsel said another bench is examining whether these apps are akin to gambling, requiring them to be banned, and the decision in that case would have a direct bearing on reliefs sought in a PIL filed by K A Paul. But the bench said, ""You (the Centre) do not appear to take the problem seriously"".The judges also issued notices to some states, RBI, ED, TRAI, Google India, Apple India, Dream11 and other gaming companies to file responses in two weeks.The petitioner had sought a complete ban on illegal betting apps and strict regulation of online gaming and fantasy sports, alleging these are being popularised by film stars, famous cricketers and other celebrities and end up drawing youth to the apps like moths to a flame. He said the more than 150-year-old Public Gambling Act, 1867, is unable to deal with the menace.Over 24 incidents of suicide have been reported from Telangana alone in the last one and a half years and are directly linked to debt traps created by gambling/betting platforms.","Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the counsel for Centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating"" The judges also issued notices to some states, RBI, ED, TRAI, Google India, Apple India, Dream11 and other gaming companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123051761,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/123051761.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The stampede at New Delhi Railway Station on Feb 15 that claimed 18 lives was triggered due to a ""big headload falling from one of the passengers"", railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Rajya Sabha on Friday, quoting the findings of a high-level inquiry committee.In a written reply to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman about the status of the committee constituted to investigate the stampede, Vaishnaw submitted that the incident happened on foot overbridge (FOB)-3 stairs connecting platforms 14/15 at the station. Sufficient crowd management protocols were in place to handle the overall volume of passengers at the station on that day, he claimed.Also read: Toll rises to 9 in Mansa Devi stampede; 2 still critical ""There was a gradual increase of passenger density on the FOB after 20.15 hrs. Many of the passengers were carrying big headloads, affecting smooth movement on the FOB. A big headload fell from one of the passengers and the pressure was passed on to the PF 14/15 stairs resulting in the tripping of passengers on the stairs. This led to an incident at 20.48 hrs on FOB-3, which was limited to the stairs of FOB. Consequently, passengers fell on each other. In the incident, 18 people lost their lives and 15 others were injured,"" Vaishnaw said in the written reply.Indian Railways has paid Rs 2 crore as ex gratia to 33 victims and their family members-Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased, Rs 2.5 lakh each to the grievously injured, and Rs one lakh each to those with simple injuries.Also read: How New Delhi railway station stampede unfolded On the corrective steps being taken, the ministry said a series of measures had been planned to handle heavy rush at stations, including creation of permanent holding areas at 73 identified stations, such as New Delhi, Anand Vihar, Ghaziabad, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Surat, which periodically face heavy crowds.There is a plan to have complete access control, meaning only passengers with confirmed reserved tickets will be given direct access to the platforms and other passengers will wait in the outside waiting area.

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

UPI New Rules 2025: Top Things to Know

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API

Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem. Changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.

Will there be a long weekend?

Note:

August is often a busy month for students across India, filled with academic schedules, Independence Day activities, and mid-term assessments. But it also offers a series of public holidays and regional observances that can bring a much-needed pause.August stands out because it includes national celebrations like Independence Day, along with various state-specific observances and religious festivals. While some holidays are limited to specific regions or communities, others bring long weekends that are useful for both rest and preparation. Whether you're planning a study break, or simply catching up on assignments, here’s a list of school holidays in August 2025 to help you plan better.Here are the major holidays that apply across most schools in India:Raksha Bandhan is widely celebrated in northern and central India to honour the bond between siblings. Schools in many states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, usually declare a holiday on this day.Observed mainly in West Bengal, Odisha, and parts of eastern India, Jhulan Purnima celebrates the divine swing festival of Radha and Krishna.Some regional schools may remain closed during this period.Independence Day is a national holiday across all Indian states. Most schools observe the occasion with flag hoisting and cultural programs, followed by a day off.Janmashtami, marking the birth of Lord Krishna, is a public holiday in many states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Depending on regional tradition, schools may declare a holiday either on August 16 or the preceding/following day.Onam is Kerala’s biggest harvest festival, celebrated with cultural events, pookalam (flower rangoli), and traditional feasts. Schools across Kerala typically remain closed for multiple days, especially around Thiruvonam, the festival’s main day.Ganesh Chaturthi is an official holiday in states like Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana. Schools in these regions remain closed to allow students to participate in rituals, home celebrations, and public processions.In addition to national holidays, several region-specific observances may apply based on your state’s academic calendar or school board guidelines.Yes, students may get a long weekend from August 15 to 17 if schools remain closed on Saturday, August 16. Additionally, if your school observes Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami holidays in succession, you could see shorter study weeks during mid to late August.While holidays are ideal for rest, many students also use this time to revise, complete pending assignments, or prepare for upcoming exams. If you're in senior secondary classes, this could also be a good time to begin short-term courses, practice mock tests, or explore college options if you’re in Class 12.Younger students can use the break for hobby classes, reading, or short family trips, depending on how your school has scheduled internal assessments.Check with your school’s official holiday calendar or circular, as some private and state board schools may differ in observance dates based on local declarations or weekend policies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

NEW DELHI: Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy found himself at the centre of a political and media storm on Friday after remarks he made about young journalists drew sharp criticism from press bodies and social media users alike.The comments came during the 10th anniversary celebration of Telugu daily Nava Telangana, where he contrasted senior journalists' dedication with what he described as the arrogance and lack of etiquette among younger reporters.""To analyse, they (journalists) keep their health and families at stake. To understand the problems of people, they go to remote areas for days and stay in public to publish their findings,"" Reddy said, praising senior journalists. He then criticised younger journalists, saying, ""Now, young journalists don’t even know about those senior journalists. They don’t even have the common sense to stand up when those senior journalists come. .. I sometimes feel like slapping them.

Press associations have demanded a clarification, though Reddy has not issued any formal response.At the same event, the CM also criticised political parties for launching media outlets to serve their interests. ""Some parties start political party-owned media to cover up their irregularities, protect their wealth and tarnish the image of those questioning them,"" he said, adding that such practices hurt journalism. He further alleged that some reporters were essentially political activists and cautioned genuine journalists to differentiate themselves.""Today, somebody who does not know an alphabet says I am a journalist. If we ask him, he says I am a social media journalist. He identifies himself as a journalist,"" he remarked.Reddy also addressed concerns over the rise of social media-driven misinformation and pointed to recent arrests of influencers who allegedly collaborated with foreign entities, post Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Tension gripped Yavat village in Daund tehsil of Pune district on Friday afternoon after an allegedly objectionable WhatsApp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.An irate mob vandalised properties and set a motorcycle ablaze, prompting police to use teargas and resort to a lathi charge to disperse crowds.Officials confirm no injuries or casualties, and say the situation is now under control, reported PTI.Police said the objectionable post was allegedly related to a Hindu religious figure.The post went viral Friday afternoon, sparking anger in a village already tense due to a past incident involving the desecration of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.By evening, mobs gathered and vandalised a bakery, torched a motorcycle, and damaged other properties. Police responded with teargas and a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. No injuries or casualties have been reported so far.Police confirmed the youth who posted the content was not a permanent resident of Yavat. He had been staying with his grandmother for some time after moving from Nanded.The authorities are investigating his motive and whether there are any links to previous provocations in the area.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered and the youth is currently in police custody.In view of the unrest, Section 144 has been imposed in Yavat village for 48 hours to prevent gatherings and maintain peace. Heavy police deployment, including teams from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), has been put in place. Senior officers from Pune Rural police are stationed in the area, ANI reported.“We are appealing to all citizens not to believe in rumours. Strict action will be taken against those trying to disturb communal harmony,” said SP (Pune Rural) Pankaj Deshmukh.CM Devendra Fadnavis also issued a strong statement: “Some people are deliberately trying to disturb peace by posting offensive content.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday rejected suggestions of any strain in India-Russia relations following sharp attacks from US President Donald Trump, who questioned the economic and strategic ties between the two countries.Responding to questions at the weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country. India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.”The MEA’s response came a day after Trump criticised both countries on his social media platform, Truth Social.“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump posted. “We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.”Jaiswal, when asked about Trump’s broader comments, reiterated the importance of the India-US partnership: “India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership anchored in shared interests, democratic values, and robust people-to-people ties.This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward. ”Also Read: Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Asked about defence cooperation, Jaiswal added: “The sourcing of our defence requirements is determined solely by our national security imperatives and strategic assessments.”He declined to comment on Trump’s suggestion that India might one day purchase oil from Pakistan, saying, “I have no comments to offer in this matter.”On questions related to sanctions imposed by the US on Indian companies trading with Iran, Jaiswal said, “We have taken note of the sanctions, we are looking into it.”He also addressed reports suggesting Indian oil firms had stopped sourcing Russian oil: “You are aware of our broad approach to energy sourcing requirements, that we look at what is available in the market and the prevailing global situation. We are not aware of any specifics.”Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier in recent months, accounting for nearly 35–40 per cent of its imports—up from just 0.2 per cent before the Ukraine war.On Thursday, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament that the government is closely examining the developments and will safeguard national interest.“Government gives utmost priority to the safeguarding of welfare of farmers, labourers, entrepreneurs, industrialists, exporters, MSMEs and stakeholders of the industrial sector,” Goyal said. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard our national interest.”","The ministry of external affairs rejected suggestions of any strain in India- Russia relations.

He blamed senior Congress leaders including Sharad Pawar, Digvijay Singh, Sushilkumar Shinde, Shivraj Patil, P Chidambaram, Jayant Patil, Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Shakeel Ahmed, and Ahmed Patel for the case. “If the Hindu community had not realised its duty and changed the government in 2014, we could not have come out alive,” he said, urging Hindus to ""never vote for Congress so that no innocent is trapped again. ""Kulkarni further alleged that investigating officers were pressured and evidence was tampered with. “Even the ATS and other officers were pressurised and evidence were erased or manipulated. There were a lot of ATS officers who didn’t know their statements were falsely recorded by their seniors,” he said.He claimed the motive behind implicating them was their opposition to Congress’ actions. “This was a conspiracy to defame Hindu community globally and mislead the minorities. .. the Congress leadership has been supporting the Pakistani ISI and if we want to save our future generations, Congress should completely be erased,” he added.Retired police inspector Mehiboob Mujawar, who was with the ATS during the initial investigation, echoed concerns about the legitimacy of the probe.

As I did not obey, a false case was registered against me which destroyed my 40-year career,” Mujawar said. He asserted, “There was no saffron terrorism.

Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage.

The ECI attributed the drop to 22.34 lakh deaths, 36.28 lakh voters permanently shifting away, and 7.01 lakh duplicate registrations.Rijiju also criticised the Opposition for stalling Parliament. “Crores of rupees are spent on running Parliament. The Congress and its allies should apologise to people for their conduct,” he said. He claimed the disruptions prevent MPs from raising other pressing issues and violate parliamentary norms.

Indian Footwear Giant Warns of Heavy Blow From Trump’s New Tariffs on Imports

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda has strongly criticized US President Donald Trump over his recent comments describing India’s economy as “dead.” In a sharp statement issued on Friday, Gowda said Trump’s remarks were ""baseless and ill-tempered"" and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for standing firm in the face of US pressure and for not compromising the nation's interests.Calling Trump “a head of state so volatile, uncivil and irresponsible,” Gowda said even a small trader or poor farmer in India, who works with dignity and integrity, could teach the US President a lesson in conduct.""There is something fundamentally wrong with him which reason, diplomacy or statecraft cannot diagnose and address"", the senior leader said. He added that ""It may not be correct to say anything more than this on his ill-tempered nature because it would mean lowering our own standards.""The former PM hailed India’s democratic and sovereign character, stating that the country has always acted in its national interest. He expressed confidence in India’s ability to withstand international pressure and said he was proud of PM Modi for not being threatened by Trump's bullying.""I am very happy and proud that India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not compromised our national interest.It has not blinked to Mr. Trump’s bullying and has shown that it will never be dictated by threat,"" the statement read.Gowda also defended India’s economic performance, noting that it remains one of the fastest growing economies in the world and currently ranks fifth globally. Responding to Trump’s “dead economy” jibe, he said the US President was either “blind or ill-informed.""He further warned some Indian opposition leaders who echoed Trump’s statements, urging them not to act as “deluded spokespersons” of the US President.Gowda’s statement came after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Indian goods starting August 1, following a breakdown in interim trade negotiations between the two countries. In his Truth Social post, Trump also said that India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” sparking strong reactions.","HD Deve Gowda has strongly criticized US President Donald Trump over his recent comments describing India's economy as ""dead"" In a sharp statement issued on Friday, Gowda said Trump's remarks were ""baseless and ill-tempered"" He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for standing firm in the face of US pressure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123044484,imgsize-1156175,width-400,resizemode-4/123044484.jpg"

NEW DELHI: More than 65 lakh names were left out of Bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the Election Commission (EC), following a month-long Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise. The EC said Patna alone accounts for the highest number of missing voters, with 3.95 lakh names not included, followed by East Champaran, Madhubani and Gopalganj with 3 lakh voters, news agency PTI reported.The new draft rolls were released on Friday, kicking off a process during which citizens can file claims and objections until 1 September.The EC said Bihar had 7.93 crore registered voters before the SIR began in June, but no final tally for the revised rolls has been disclosed. According to EC data, 7.23 crore voters submitted enumeration forms during the exercise. Around 35 lakh were found to have permanently migrated or were untraceable, 22 lakh were reported dead, and 7 lakh were registered in more than one constituency. Another 1.2 lakh voters didn’t submit forms at all.The process involved 77,895 polling centres across the state, supervised by 243 Electors Registration Officers and nearly 3,000 assistant EROs.More than 1.60 lakh booth-level agents and other volunteers were involved in the data-gathering operation, which required voters to return signed enumeration forms along with identity documents, either physically or online.The EC has not published a consolidated statewide list, but voters can verify their status on the official website. District magistrates have shared draft rolls with political party representatives in districts such as Supaul, Nawada, Darbhanga, and Jamui. Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.The SIR has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties, who allege that the mass exclusions serve to benefit the ruling NDA. Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, which remarked earlier this week that the exercise should result in “en masse inclusion and not en masse exclusion.”Meanwhile, Parliament witnessed heated scenes over the SIR issue. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Friday amid loud protests by opposition members demanding a discussion on the EC’s move. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed a “paramilitary takeover” after security personnel reportedly blocked MPs from entering the well of the House. Deputy chairman Harivansh denied requests for discussion, citing that the matter is sub judice, which only intensified the standoff.","More than 65 lakh names were left out of Bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the Election Commission.

NEW DELHI: More than a year after explicit videos allegedly featuring former MP Prajwal Revanna triggered a political storm ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a special court in Bengaluru on Friday convicted him in one of the four rape cases registered against him.The special court for elected representatives, presided over by Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, found Revanna guilty in a case involving the rape of a domestic help at his family's Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura, Hassan district.Revanna, who is the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and a now-expelled JD(S) leader, broke down and was seen weeping in court after the verdict was announced, as per news agency ANI.Also read: Former PM Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping domestic help The woman, then 48, alleged that she had been raped twice in 2021 and that the acts were recorded on his mobile phone.

The verdict, initially due on July 30, had been delayed as the court sought clarification on technical matters. It was finally delivered on August 1.Prajwal Revanna is the prime accused in four separate criminal cases, all involving allegations of rape, sexual harassment, and criminal intimidation.The cases came to light in April 2024 after pen drives containing obscene video clips, allegedly involving Revanna, were circulated in Hassan. The scandal erupted just before the Lok Sabha elections, dealing a blow to Revanna’s political career—he lost the Hassan seat by over 40,000 votes.The Karnataka government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the allegations, and that Revanna was arrested on May 31, 2024 at Bengaluru airport after returning from Germany, where he had stayed for 35 days.In November 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the Karnataka high court’s rejection of both regular and anticipatory bail. “Dismissed,” said Justice Bela M. Trivedi, while Justice Satish Chandra Sharma added that there were several complaints against him. “You are so powerful,” the bench remarked when senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Revanna, argued that Section 376 (rape) was not cited in the original complaint.Also Read: Who is Prajwal Revanna?

How big a problem is

digital addiction

, especially for the young? How can they be helped to overcome its ill effects?

How can the young protect their mental health in the modern, fast-paced world? Are changes required in the education system?

Is there an effective way to deal with stress?

You recently had two brain surgeries. How did you and those who are close to you handle the anxiety?

How did you separate physical pain from mental suffering?

It is not technology that is the problem, compulsiveness is. Today, in many countries, they have technology de-addiction centres, where people go to learn how to live without a phone! It's a huge achievement for them to put their phone away for whatever number of days.The beautiful thing about technology is if you learn to use it, it works for you. But who you are will decide how you use it. So what we need to fix right now in the world is who we are. We have all become many things that we are not. Essentially, we are born as life on this planet; the rest of the things are taught to us. We should stop teaching all this stuff which makes us something other than human beings.The internet or a phone is not the problem, but what is on it is the question. Now, some children are playing video games on phones. Two-three hours a day they are practising how to kill someone. Once they turn 18, will they be satisfied just shooting them on the phone? We are putting our children through this, and then we think they are violent, that they are wrong. No. Who is putting this content on the phone? Is it the children? No, adults are putting it - everything has become about commerce.Technology is a tremendous enabler. It gives us the means to reach the entire humanity. This was never possible before. When you have this capability, why do we think we cannot transform the world? We can. But are we committed to making it happen?Instead of reacting compulsively, we must learn to respond consciously to everything.When the British left India, literacy rate was low. Initially, our focus was on basic literacy. However, now the time has come for education to become more specialised and competency-oriented. Today, fewer students are opting for core sciences because our education system has always been job-oriented. Yes, that focus was necessary at one point. But many parents today can support their children as they pursue something meaningful - even if it doesn't immediately translate into economic benefit.We can relax the pace and focus on core education - on sciences, the arts, music. And even within technology, we need to encourage work at the cutting edge, which requires a much deeper level of application. Because if you don't immerse yourself in something, nothing profound will ever come of it.Stress is not in the situation; stress is in the way we are. It's not caused by your job, relationship, or anything external. It's because you haven't learned to manage your body, mind, emotions, and energies. When I first went to the US, I heard the term 'stress management'. I couldn't understand it. Why would anyone want to manage stress? You manage your money, business, relationships - not stress. But in the West, they've come to believe that stress is a universal condition and needs to be managed. However, stress is not a universal phenomenon, it's an individual malady.I had never been in a hospital before; the gown, the setting - everything was new. Was it painful? Absolutely - 100%. Did I suffer mentally? No.Pain is physical. If pain didn't exist, you wouldn't know how to protect your body. Suffering, however, is something you manufacture in your mind. As far as possible, when you walk through life, your job is to avoid creating suffering for others. But if you have mastered the art of creating suffering for yourself, you will inevitably create suffering for others too, knowingly or unknowingly.","Technology is not the problem, but what is on it is the question, says Sadhguru.

Three months later Ashish executed a registered sale deed for his share in his father's property in favour of another person. Unaware of this sale, the four women applied for mutation of the land as per the will and revenue authority made necessary changes in the revenue records in Sept 1994.When the purchaser of Ashish's share started constructing on the land, the women approached the civil court, which restrained him. The purchaser's claim based on the sale deed was rejected. He then in league with Ashish filed a criminal complaint case in court accusing the women of creating a forged will.","Ram Baksh Dubey executed an unregistered will on Dec 23, 1993, bequeathing all his moveable and immoveable properties in the name of his four daughters-in-law.

Revenue can’t be earned at cost of environment: SC

New Delhi: Reminding Centre and the states that earning revenue should not be prioritised over the ecology and environment, Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over uncontrolled constructions and inflow of tourists in Himachal Pradesh, saying the day is not far when the Himalayan state may vanish from the map of the country if remedial action is not taken on time.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadev said that in recent years, the state witnessed many natural disasters, and it is humans, not nature, who are responsible for floods, continuous landsliding of mountains and soil, collapsing of houses and buildings, and road subsidence in which hundreds of people perished. These disasters are man-made and it is not right to blame nature for it, the court said.It appealed to Centre and the state government to intervene and stem the rot on an urgent basis.SC said, “Nature has given abundant beauty to the state of HP... Taking advantage of this natural beauty, the government started constructing four-lane roads to promote it as a tourist destination. To build these roads, heavy machinery and explosives materials were used according to various reports to cut the mountains, due to which the natural balance of the place has started to deteriorate.”“We want to impress upon state government and Union of India that earning revenue is not everything. Revenue cannot be earned at the cost of the environment and ecology. If things proceed the way they are as on date, then the day is not far when the entire state of HP may vanish into thin air from the map...,” it said.“The pace of infrastructure development in Himachal has intensified in recent years, driven by the twin goals of connectivity and tourism... In many cases, hill slopes are cut steeply, unscientifically, without adequate stabilisation measures, and natural watercourses are obstructed or diverted. This not only alters the local hydrology but also makes the terrain more vulnerable to landslides and flash floods.“The 2023 and 2025 monsoon season, for example, saw widespread devastation in the Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba districts, partly attributed to such unscientific construction. Despite having been an environmentally rich state, its own people are today responsible for such blind pursuit of development, to their own detriment,” the court said.",Supreme Court expresses deep concern over uncontrolled constructions and inflow of tourists in Himachal Pradesh. Reminding Centre and states that earning revenue should not be prioritised over the ecology and environment. Appeals to Centre and the state government to intervene and stem the rot on an urgent basis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123051742,imgsize-62378,width-400,resizemode-4/123051742.jpg"

Due disclosure made to stock exchanges: Reliance ADAG

New Delhi: Enforcement Directorate on Friday put travel curbs on Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani by issuing a lookout circular after summoning him for questioning at the agency HQ here on Aug 5 in connection with an alleged money laundering racket involving group entities. The summons were based on findings of probes being conducted by multiple agencies.On Friday, ED searched three premises in Bhubaneswar and one in Kolkata after finding alleged evidence of Rs 68-crore fake bank guarantee provided to Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd. The guarantee was generated by a shell entity registered in Bhubaneswar, allegedly linked to ADAG.Reacting to the allegations, ADAG said: ""The company and its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and have been a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy.""In its defence, Reliance ADAG said, “The company has made a due disclosure on this to the stock exchanges on Nov 7, 2024. A criminal complaint has already been lodged with the Economic Offence Wing of Delhi Police against the third party on Oct 16, 2024.The due process of law will follow”.“Multiple undisclosed bank accounts have been detected having suspicious transactions of several crores of rupees ,” ED sources said. “Key individuals of the group have been found using Telegram app with ‘disappearing messages’ enabled, indicating attempts to conceal communication.”ED has registered a separate money laundering investigation based on an FIR registered by economic offences wing of Delhi Police in Nov 2024. Searches took place in Bhubaneswar at three premises of Biswal Tradelink and its directors and one premise of an associated operator.The Bhubaneswar entity, now being allegedly linked to Anil Ambani’s group, is a mere paper entity, which was registered at a residential property belonging to an associate, and had suspicious financial transactions with multiple companies.Sources said evidence of generating fake bank guarantees was seized during July 24 searches on ADAG companies. Officials alleged the bank guarantee of Rs 68.2 crore submitted to Solar Energy Corporation of India has been established as fake.“In an attempt to prove that this fake bank guarantee is genuine, the group used a spoofed email domain. Instead of sbi.co.in, the domain s-bi.co.in was deployed to send forged communication to SECI, impersonating SBI,” a source added. ED has sought domain registration details of s-bi.co.in from National Internet Exchange of India.", Enforcement Directorate issues lookout circular after summoning Anil Ambani for questioning.

Fewer deletions in 23 Bihar districts with big minority population

NEW DELHI: The draft roll for Bihar published by the Election Commission on Friday includes 7.24 crore electors who submitted their enumeration forms within the July 25 deadline. Bihar's electorate, as per the draft roll, is over 65.6 lakh less than its 7.9 crore strength on June 24, 2025, ahead of the onset of the special intensive revision.This figure of 65.6 lakh, made public by EC on July 27 after conclusion of the first phase of SIR, includes 22 lakh dead electors, 36 lakh permanently shifted or absent/untraceable, 7 lakh voters enrolled at more than one place and electors who did not submit their enumeration forms.As many as 15 districts have recorded a higher than state average, though not alarming, percentage of exclusions from the draft roll. These include Gopalganj (15.1%), Purnea (12.1%), Kishanganj (11.8%), Madhubani (10.4%) and Bhagalpur (10.2%). Kishanganj and Purnea are districts with allegedly high concentration of illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kishanganj is also the only Muslim majority district in Bihar, while Purnia has over 38.4% Muslims.Interestingly, Araria and Katihar - where Muslims' share in the population is 43-44% and which also allegedly have Bangladeshi immigrant settlers - have recorded exclusions (7.6% and 8.2%) short of the state average of 8.3%.EC said any elector or party can now file claims and objections with ERO till Sept 1, seeking addition of wrongfully excluded electors or deletions of ineligible ones. From Saturday, EC will release a daily update on claims and objections.The draft roll points to an uneven pattern with 23 of the 38 districts reporting fewer deletions than the state average of 8.3%. These 23 districts include those with a notable minority population.Booth-wise draft lists of all 90,712 polling stations across all 243 assembly constituencies have been shared with all the political parties by 38 district election officers of the state.Videos of district presidents and BLAs of all parties, acknowledging receipt of the draft lists and appealing for claims and objections to be made over the next one month, against any wrongful inclusions and exclusions.EC on Friday hailed the “unprecedented participation” by Bihar’s over 7.2 crore electors who turned in their enumeration forms; and the “unparallelled, transparent and impartial teamwork” by its machinery comprising the chief electoral officer, 38 DEOs, 243 electoral registration officers (EROs), 2,976 assistant EROs, booth-level officers of 90,712 polling booths and lakhs of volunteers; apart from the 1.6 lakh booth-level agents nominated by 12 political parties of the state.The panel on Friday appealed to all eligible electors to check their names in the draft roll and, if missing, to fill and submit Form 6 with the declaration form recording their citizenship status. Young voters who turned 18 on July 1 or will become adults by Oct 1, were also told to apply through Form 6.EC on Friday reiterated that no name can be deleted from the draft roll without giving a notice, hearing the elector and subsequently passing a written order. A two-point appeal can be filed against the ERO’s decision, first with the district magistrate and then with the CEO.","The draft roll for Bihar published by the Election Commission on Friday includes 7.24 crore electors.

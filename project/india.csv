Tamil Nadu elections: EPS meets PM Modi at Trichy airport; first meet since AIADMK and BJP alliance renewed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-elections-eps-welcomes-pm-modi-at-trichy-airport-first-meet-since-aiadmk-and-bjp-alliance-renewed/articleshow/122930934.cms,"NEW DELHI: AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) received Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Trichy airport on Saturday night.

Looking forward to tomorrow’s programme at Gangaikonda Cholapuram. ""In the post, one picture sparked the question whether AIADMK and BJP is going to make alliance or not. EPS and PM Modi is meeting for the first time since the AIADMK and BJP renewed their alliance.The meeting came amid the war of words between the allies ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. Earlier, EPS ruled out a coalition government with the BJP and said, “Our alliance would achieve a grand success in 2026. AIADMK will be victorious and will form a govt on its own.""This statement contradicts with Amit Shah's interview where he said that that the NDA led by the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu will form a coalition government.Recently, EPS reaffirmed that his party will form a government with an absolute majority in the upcoming assembly elections.

Instead, the AIADMK alliance will win in 210 seats.AIADMK will form the govt with an absolute majority,"" he said.The ruling DMK has attacked the AIADMK for reviving ties with the BJP, saying that the saffron party would swallow EPS. EPS fired back and replied, ""Stalin says BJP will swallow Palaniswami. Is Palaniswami a worm to be swallowed by a fish? You are the one swallowing many of your allies. Congress has diminished, Communists have disappeared, and VCK is sticking around with DMK.""EPS also rebutted the criticism that AIADMK will be divided by BJP. ""Stalin is warning us that AIADMK will break and that I should be careful. I would like to tell him that AIADMK will not break,"" EPS said.The AIADMK and BJP came together for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

"2006 Mumbai train blasts: It started in a jail cell. Now, it fights to free those wrongfully jailed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2006-mumbai-train-blasts-it-started-in-a-jail-cell-now-it-fights-to-free-those-wrongfully-jailed/articleshow/122930276.cms,"LONG BATTLE: Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, was acquitted in the case in 2015. Soon, his role shifted from accused to advocate

Besides its work on the 11/7 case, the Innocence Network India is helping other terror accused with legal aid

A narrow, rain-soaked lane in Mumbai’s Vikhroli leads to a small ground-floor room. Inside, a few chairs, a chatai, shelves of books, and maps of India and the world hang on the wall. This unassuming space is the ‘secretariat’ of Innocence Network India, a coalition of lawyers, prison-rights activists and civil society groups who work for “the rights of those wrongfully prosecuted or convicted, especially under terrorism charges.”On July 21, when the Bombay high court acquitted all 12 men convicted of the 2006 Mumbai train blasts — also known as the 11/7 bombings — some credit was due to this little-known coalition that kept the pressure alive, along with the efforts of the Maharashtra unit office of Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind.Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, is visibly happy, and yet combative, seated in his two-room tenement. It’s where Shaikh, a school teacher in Nagpada, central Mumbai, spends most of his after-school hours running Acquit Undertrial, his one-man YouTube channel that amplifies cases of alleged wrongful prosecution and demands compensation for acquitted convicts. It was here that he recorded a congratulatory message for the accused and their families the night before the verdict.“I was 100% sure HC would exonerate them. I recorded it before the order was pronounced,” says Shaikh. He should know. He was one of 13 men arrested under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for the train blasts. He spent nine years in Arthur Road jail before being acquitted in 2015. The only one to walk free at the time.Soon after, his role shifted from accused to advocate. On the day the prosecution sought death for eight and life terms for four, Shaikh was in court filing applications to allow two of the accused — Ehtesham Siddiqui and Sajid Ansari — to appear for their LLB exams.That day, he said, “This is not the end of the road. There are more doors to knock on, and a longer way to go.” In the decade since, that road became his life’s work. Outside of his teaching job at a school in Nagpada, Shaikh has devoted himself to helping undertrials and families left waiting as years passed.His journey from accused to advocate began in jail. Inside the anda cell, he read 10 newspapers a day in four languages, filed dozens of RTIs, and helped other inmates prepare their defence. He earned an LLB, an MA in English, and wrote ‘Begunah Qaidi’, a 400-page Urdu memoir that was later translated into Hindi and English and adapted into a film.By 2016, less than two years after his own acquittal, Shaikh had formalised his work by founding the Innocence Network, a coalition of lawyers, retired judges, activists, and filmmakers committed to fighting wrongful arrests and prolonged incarceration. The collective organises seminars, people’s tribunals, and public campaigns for those caught in the crosshairs of terror cases. “Innocence Network is an NGO for the exonerees, by the exonerees and of the exonerees,” explains Shaikh, 48. He adds that many of the RTIs he filed from prison helped him and the other accused during trial.“We had to build our case from the inside,” he says. “That became the foundation for everything that followed.” The idea came from innocence projects across the globe. “Such networks by civil society groups exist in different countries. When we saw how many men were wrongly framed in terror cases and later acquitted by the courts as state failed to prove their culpability, we realised the need for such a network in India too,” says Sharib Aqleem Ali, co-founder and scholar-activist.Over the past eight years, Innocence Network has run mobile legal-aid clinics and awareness drives. But one of its most visible tools has been People’s Tribunal, a citizen-led public hearing that highlights stories the courts often overlook.At the first such tribunal in Delhi on Oct 2, 2016, chaired by retired Delhi high court Chief Justice A P Shah, around 15 acquitted individuals shared testimonies and filmmaker Saeed Mirza was among the eight-member jury whose recommendations later informed Law Commission’s Report No. 277.“One of those recommendations was that India ratify UN Convention Against Torture, which it has signed but never formally adopted,” says Delhi-based lawyer and network facilitator Fawaz Shaheen. Another key recommendation was repeal of Section 18 of MCOCA, which allows confessions made in police custody to be admissible, an issue central to the 11/7 trial.A second tribunal, held in Kolkata in 2017, heard testimonies from 20 more acquitted in terror cases. The network has also compiled a dossier based on letters written by the 11/7 accused from prison, and continues to file RTIs to uncover procedural lapses and custodial irregularities. Regular meetings are held by the coalition that runs on pro bono support with mentors like retired Bombay HC judge B G Kolse Patil.As for the blasts case, the legal fight isn’t over yet. Bombay HC order acquitting all 12 has been stayed by Supreme Court. And from this tiny room in Vikhroli, the battle continues.","Innocence Network India is helping other terror accused with legal aid. Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, was acquitted in the case in 2015. He was one of 13 men arrested under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for the train blasts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122930271,imgsize-1325866,width-400,resizemode-4/122930271.jpg"
"Karnataka government geotags over 31,000 waterbodies in restoration effort",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-government-geotags-over-31000-waterbodies-in-restoration-effort/articleshow/122929870.cms,"BENGALURU: In a move to safeguard its water resources and protect lakes, the Karnataka govt launched a project involving the geotagging of lakes in March 2024. The project, taken up by the department of minor irrigation and groundwater development in collaboration with the department of survey, settlement and land records, seeks to geotag all 41,875 waterbodies in the state.As of April 2025, as many as 31,033 waterbodies were geotagged. Locals and panchayats are pitching in, turning conservation into a community mission. With this, the govt can track real-time updates, including water flow and encroachments.Till April, the state had surveyed and mapped 34,651 lakes spanning 7.7 lakh acres. In the process, it identified 42,678 acres of lake encroachment; of this, 28,750 acres have been cleared and restored, while the remaining are in the process of being recovered. Among the districts, Hassan has the highest number of geotagged waterbodies so far, while Ballari has the least. Community participation has played a key role in ensuring the project's progress, with gram panchayats helping in identifying lake boundaries, resolving local disputes and validating field data.Legal enforcement has also been made easier through geotagging. When encroachments are detected using data, the authorities concerned fine those responsible. The geotagged data is being used to support drought resilience and groundwater recharge planning, and aligns with the Karnataka State Action Plan on Climate Change, the Bengaluru Climate Action & Resilience Plan, and World Bank's water resilience project.Officials say this integrated approach will help the state strengthen flood-control measures, improve water storage, and secure the long-term water availability across the urban & rural areas across the state.","The project seeks to geotag all 41,875 waterbodies in the state.

AGRA: Rajveer Singh Yadav was never the man police meant to arrest. It was his brother Ramveer they wanted. But one clerical mistake - a swapped name - landed Rajveer behind bars for 22 days. While cops admitted to the error within weeks, the case dragged on for 17 years in court, wrecking his livelihood, his kids' education, and his peace of mind. Now at 55, Rajveer has finally been acquitted.A Mainpuri court on Saturday declared Rajveer Singh Yadav innocent and ordered action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.I kept insisting I wasn't the one. But they didn't listen. They just picked me up and sent me to jail,"" Rajveer, father of three daughters and a son, told TOI on Saturday. ""I fought the case for 17 years. At the time, no one even knew who had filed the case - they just saw my name and dragged me in. I couldn't work. I couldn't educate my children. I lost everything.""He added: ""I somehow managed to get my daughters married. My son had to drop out. We were destroyed. I just want the officers who did this to me to be held accountable.At the very least, I should be compensated for what I've gone through.""The case goes back to Aug 31, 2008, when Mainpuri police filed an FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) and provisions of the SC/ST Act against four men, including Manoj Yadav, Pravesh Yadav, Bhola Yadav, and Ramveer Singh Yadav - all from Nagla Bhant village, Mainpuri - following a clash allegedly linked to an election dispute. The Gangster Act was added soon after.However, when the gang chart was prepared, the then SHO of Mainpuri Kotwali, Omprakash, made a critical error: instead of Ramveer, he listed Rajveer Singh Yadav - Ramveer's elder brother. The investigation was handed over to sub-inspector Shivsagar Dixit, the then SHO of Dannahar police station, Rajveer's lawyer Vinod Kumar Yadav said.On Dec 1 that year, Rajveer was arrested. From jail, he moved a plea before the special Gangster Act court in Agra, insisting that he had been wrongly named. The court summoned the officers concerned. On Dec 22, inspector Omprakash admitted before the judge that Rajveer's name had been ""added by mistake"". The court passed his release order the same day.Judge Mohammed Iqbal, who was then hearing Gangster Act cases, even wrote to the SSP of Mainpuri recommending disciplinary action against the erring cops. But despite the admission in court and the judge's warning, SI Shivsagar Dixit still filed a chargesheet against Rajveer - and the case continued.","Mainpuri court declares Rajveer Singh Yadav innocent and orders action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.

Kiren Rijiju Rips Into Rahul Gandhi Over Remarks On Jaishankar-Xi Meeting In China

NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju shared an embarrassing yet unforgettable anecdote from his early days in politics, when his very first request to the Lok Sabha Speaker was for a “smoking room. ”Recalling his first meeting with Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Kiren Rijiju said he walked out with a “good scolding” and a lasting lesson- to ""approach such offices with more purpose.""""The first time I met Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, I had gone to request a room for MPs who smoke.

'It Is Reasonable That...': Indian Envoy's Big Remark On Russia-India-China Troika Revival

‘Rudra brigades to have all combat elements, to be deployed together’

NEW DELHI: With the collusive military threat from China and Pakistan figuring high on India's radar screens, which was reinforced during Operation Sindoor , the Army is now setting up some new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades and 'Bhairav' light commando battalions for a greater and swifter offensive punch along the borders.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and will also progressively equip all its 400-odd infantry battalions with drone platoons, against the backdrop of drone warfare upending all conventional military tactics in conflicts across the globe.Announcing these steps towards transforming and modernising the Army into ""a future-ready force"" during the Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass on Saturday, General Upendra Dwivedi said India had delivered ""a well-planned, precise, and decisive response"" to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities to ""achieve a decisive victory"".We gave them (Pakistan) a chance for peace but they acted with cowardice. We then answered with only valour...Operation Sindoor is our resolve, our message, and our response,"" General Upendra Dwivedi said, warning Pakistan against misadventures in the future. ""With the unwavering trust of the countrymen and the strategic autonomy granted by the govt, the Army delivered a well-planned, precise, and decisive response.The Army chief's transformation announcements involve conversion of existing units and formations, without fresh troop accretions, a senior officer told TOI. Some of the existing over 250 single-arm brigades (over 3,000 soldiers each) are now being converted to all-arms ones with integration of fighting elements like infantry, mechanised infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, Special Forces and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which will be backed by customised logistics and combat support. The bulk of the existing brigades are from the infantry, with the others being from other arms like the artillery, armoured, mechanised infantry, air defence and the like. At present, these brigades, commanded by one-star officers or brigadiers, come together only during exercises or actual combat.""Now, the ones being converted to Rudra brigades, tailor-made for specific areas and tasks along the borders, will have all combat elements and be permanently deployed together in peace and war. Their re-structuring has been validated and approved. Two Rudra brigades have already been set up,"" the senior officer said.This is in tune with the long-pending proposal to restructure some Army formations into self-contained 'integrated battle groups (IBGs)', with 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units to be commanded by Major-Generals, which is yet to be approved by the govt.The new Bhairav light commando battalions will be in addition to the existing specially-trained and equipped 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) meant for covert warfare deep behind enemy lines.The plan is to raise at least 40-50 Bhairav battalions, drawn from existing infantry units and equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, in phases. Indicating that a few have already been raised, Gen Dwivedi said, ""The agile and lethal special forces Bhairav units are ready to surprise the enemy on the borders.""""Every infantry battalion will have drone platoons, while the firepower of the artillery has been multiplied many times through Divyastra batteries and loiter munitions batteries. The Army Air Defence (AAD) is being equipped with indigenous missile systems,"" he added.The AAD is slated to get two new regiments of the Akash Prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China for Rs 8,160 crore as well as three regiments of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems for Rs 36,000 crore (which includes three squadrons also for IAF), as was reported by TOI earlier.Akash Prime has the capability to intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a 25km range, it is 30km for the highly-mobile QRSAMs. They will add to India's existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.","The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries.

NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners opposing the Election Commission's exercise told Supreme Court on Saturday, alleging irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who hadn't filled up forms getting a message that their forms had been completed.Countering EC's submission that there was no irregularity in the process, Association for Democratic Reforms and Bihar's main opposition party, RJD, said in their responses that EC's figures were of no consequence since most of the forms were collected without documents and a large number of voters continued to be at the risk of disenfranchisement.Enumeration forms are being mass uploaded by BLOs without the knowledge or consent of voters, in order to achieve the unrealistic target set by EC. Many voters have reported that their forms have been submitted online, despite never having met with any BLO or signed any documents. Forms of even dead individuals have been reported to have been submitted,"" Association for Democratic Reforms said in its response filed through advocate Neha Rathi.It said, ""This points to the flawed manner in which the current SIR is being conducted, where the integrity of electoral rolls is compromised, potentially affecting millions of voters and undermining the democratic process.The situation raises serious questions about transparency, accountability and the potential for electoral fraud, as voters express confusion and concern over how their details were uploaded without their involvement. ""RJD MP Manoj Jha, in his response filed by advocate Fauzia Shakil, said media reports pointed out countless instances where electors have complained that BLOs did not visit their house or neighbourhood, forms were not given in duplicate, no acknowledgement was given on submission of forms and photos were not taken. He said BLOs were found forging voters' signatures on forms and uploading them.""The present exercise is unprecedented inasmuch as for the first time a person is being asked to furnish a documentary proof of his citizenship to the satisfaction of Election Commission to be enrolled as a voter and exercise his constitutional right to vote. As is evident from a bare perusal of Form 6 - the application form for a new voter - and documents for proof of date of birth and documents for proof of residence were required to be furnished along with only a declaration that a person is a citizen of India,"" Jha said.Pitting former EC commissioner against the poll panel, the petitioner referred to the opinion of Ashok Lavasa, who also questioned EC's decision on SIR. They also said there was no valid reason for EC to reject SC's suggestion to accept Aadhaar, voter ID and ration cards for inclusion in electoral rolls and that the exercise being done just months before the Bihar assembly polls was creating confusion on the ground and could disenfranchise lakhs of voters.""In light of the media reports from Bihar, showing how BLOs are signing blank enumeration forms in absence of voters, the numbers as suggested by EC are circumspect and even otherwise are of no consequence since most of these forms have been collected without documents and a large number of the electorate in Bihar continues to be at the risk of disenfranchisement. It is submitted that inclusion of name in draft roll has no meaning till documents as required are submitted, and thus, the risk of disenfranchisement looms large over a huge population who has already voted in multiple elections since 2003,"" the response said.","The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners say. They allege irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who didn't fill up forms getting message that their forms had been completed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122928625,imgsize-153620,width-400,resizemode-4/122928625.jpg"

(Pic credit: AP)

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

There is no greater example I think than what we did in Operation Sindoor. Less than 50 weapons can bring the adversary to the talking table...that is an example that needs to be studied and will be studied (by scholars),"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, speaking at an interactive session during an aerospace power seminar here.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, in turn, said the armed forces need to maintain ""very high"" operational readiness round-the-clock and throughout the year because Operation Sindoor ""still continues"", while stressing that ""there are no runners-up in war"".Noting that the rapid advances in technology and the ongoing geopolitical churn have ushered in ""a third revolution in warfare"", the CDS said the Indian military needs ""information warriors, technology warriors and scholar warriors"" geared for multi-domain operations. It is essential for the military to learn both 'shastra' (warfare/weapons) and 'shaastra' (knowledge), he said.Though Air Marshal Tiwari did not specify the weapons that were used during the May 7-10 hostilities, IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structuresThe IAF vice chief also said manned systems like fighters ""still have a huge advantage"" over unmanned systems like drones, in terms of the ""compellence"" and ""coercive diplomacy"" to be imposed on an adversary, and will continue to do so for some time.""We are giving too much importance to unmanned systems. While they have a place and relevance in modern warfare, but the kind of weight of attack, the intelligence required, the kind of damage they can cause...You have to see whether they balance with what manned aerial systems bring to the table,"" he said.Different speakers at the ""Capstone"" seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies and College of Air Warfare stressed the need for India to ""prioritise"" the development of aerospace power, which was ""not escalatory"" but ""a strategic and effective tool for escalation control"" as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor. ""Operation Sindoor underlined the speed, reach and flexibility of airpower. We established escalation dominance over Pakistan,"" said a speaker.Others pointed out that India had drawn a new red line for Pakistan by stressing it will not be dissuaded by the western adversary's nuclear blackmail and continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks in the future as well.","Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace.

NEW DELHI: In a bold step, the Delhi Govt on Friday requested the Supreme Court to reconsider its 2018 blanket ban on plying of over 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles on the roads of entire National Capital Region saying stricter BS-VI norm compliant vehicles emit far less pollutants compared to BS-IV vehicles.It requested the SC to direct the Union govt or Air Quality Management to “carry out a suitable broad-based, scientific study on the need for continuance of a complete ban on playing of 15 or more years old petrol and 10 or more years old diesel vehicles of all categories in NCR, imposed by the SC through its order on Oct 10, 2018”.The Delhi govt said the blanket ban, not backed by any scientific study, does not differentiate between poorly maintained,The directive to off-road vehicles purely on the basis of age disproportionately affects the middle-class population whose vehicles are less used, well-maintained, and pollution norm compliant, the govt said. “Studies indicate that these vehicles often have significantly lower annual mileage and contribute negligibly to overall emissions,” it said.It said the significant improvement in Pollution Under Control Technology, increased coverage of PUC testing, stricter monitoring of emission standards, transition to BS-VS engines and other measures have suitably addressed the concerns that had impelled the SC to pass the order seven years ago.Road-worthiness is a technical and scientific issue that must be linked to actual emissions of a vehicle, which is required to be banned, and not a blanket ban based on the age of the vehicles, it said, echoing the popular sentiments of people living in the national capital region and Delhi.Delhi govt, through an application settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, said, “There is a need for a graded, balanced and technology riven regime to handle vehicular pollution issue and instead of blanket ban, a scientific, data-driven framework should be developed taking into account all parameters to ascertain individual emission levels of vehicles.”Repeatedly stressing that the 2018 blanket ban order needs reconsideration, the BJP govt said vehicular pollution constitutes only one of the several sources of air-pollution, including stubble burning, biomass burning, road and construction dust, industrial emissions coupled with weather and meteorological factors and the intensity of pollution varies from season to season.Delhi govt said its transport department has strictly implemented PUC has resulted in issuance of 1,63,103 challans in the first seven months of this year, compared to 29,589 challans issued in 2021, 43,494 in 2022, 36,176 in 2023, and 68,077 in 2024. It said with the augmentation of CNG and electric buses and improvement in road infrastructure, the pollution caused by vehicles has reduced.It said the good AQI days have increased from 159 in 2018 to 209 in 2024 and good AQI days this year till July was 106.

GAYA: A home guard aspirant was gang-raped, allegedly by an ambulance driver and a health department technician, while being taken to a hospital after collapsing during a fitness test in Bihar's Bodh Gaya, police said Saturday. Both accused have been arrested and an SIT is probing the case.The woman was one of around 700 candidates undergoing physical evaluation at Bihar Military Police grounds on July 24. She fainted in the scorching heat and was put in an ambulance bound for Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital about 3.5km away, or a 10-minute drive.Police said the ambulance took an unusually long time to cover the short distance. CCTV footage shows it had deviated from the direct route. At the hospital, the semi-conscious woman told emergency staff she had been raped inside the moving ambulance. ""We informed police. Officers responded to the complaint and initiated medical tests and legal procedures,"" a hospital official said.Police formed an SIT and arrested both accused late Friday. An FSL team collected biological samples. ""We're taking all steps to make the case fool-proof while ensuring her care,"" hospital superintendent Dr K K Sinha said.A senior officer said an FIR has been registered on the basis of the woman's statement. Investigators are examining why no female attendant accompanied the survivor during transit - a lapse that may have enabled the crime.The case has revived memories of a rape at Gaya's Lady Elgin Hospital (now Rani Durgawati Hospital) decades ago, where a former MP was accused.Public outrage surged online, with demands for justice and better protection for women. ""There are cases of small girls aged 4 and even women above 65. Will they get justice? Will girls live fear free in India?"" posted Henrietta Decruz on X, urging Supreme Court intervention.The crime adds to a string of brutal killings in Bihar this July, before assembly elections later this year. On July 17, five gunmen shot a murder convict on parole dead inside a Patna hospital. Businessman Gopal Khemka was gunned down outside his Patna home on July 4. Later, BJP Kisan Morcha ex-president Surendra Kewat, trader Waseem Anwar Khan, and lawyer Jitendra Kumar were also murdered.Opposition parties have seized on the crime wave as proof of govt failure in the run-up to polls.","Home guard aspirant was gang-raped, allegedly by an ambulance driver and a health department technician.

""I believe, based on data before me, that it (investment) is one of the primary drivers of sustained economic growth. It can be higher but the level at which we have maintained investment is largely on the back of public capital expenditure. We can make sure policy on FDI is friendly and attractive enough to get more investment into India. Third, I can see states also competing to attract investments and each is doing very best,"" Sitharaman said.The minister, however, indicated that companies may be sitting on large investible funds.""Is Indian private sector growing in pace with the government investment? Since 2019 once the twin balance sheet problem was addressed and corporate tax was brought down, we can see that the balance sheets of the private sector are healthier. But today, are they sitting on passive investible funds. That's an issue on which I would want industry to speak,"" she said.Asked about calls for easing restrictions on Chinese investments and business, Sitharaman sounded a note of caution. ""Post-Covid and post-Galwan, for all (land) bordering countries, we had come up with 'Press Note 3' because we didn't want big business happening with them. In some renewable energy areas, where the entire project was done by, say China, and there were difficulties in getting technical experts to travel to India, that to some extent was relaxed. During the US-China tariff war there was a lull,"" she said.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said sustaining economic growth remains the top priority for the government.

""The complainant (Walia) stated that he was forced to make a video call to the applicant/accused (Jalaluddin), who was purportedly based in Dubai, demanding hawala payments.

A chargesheet has already been filed against Jalauddin and the matter has been fixed for further proceedings on Aug 25.

The court said Yadav and Khan were arrested earlier and certain recoveries were made at their instance, but Jalaluddin was arrested on July 1 this year for his alleged role in the criminal conspiracy.After examining the relevant passport pages, the court said, ""The passport entries unequivocally confirm that both the complainant and the applicant arrived in Thailand on Jan 6, 2024.

SRINAGAR: J&K government on Saturday instructed all doctors and paramedical staff in public healthcare institutions to wear white aprons and nameplates during duty hours, reaffirming existing norms after observing instances of breach.The latest directive comes days after a scuffle outside a prominent hospital in Srinagar involving patients and journalists on one side and protesting doctors on the other. The protests stemmed from a doctor being slapped after a critically ill patient passed away.“It has been observed that doctors and paramedical staff in various government healthcare institutions are not strictly adhering to prescribed norms regarding the wearing of aprons and displaying of nameplates during duty hours. Such non-compliance is causing inconvenience to patients in identifying healthcare personnel,” a health ministry circular states and directs heads of healthcare institutions to ensure strict compliance.Many doctors and paramedical staff have avoided wearing aprons fearing attacks after alleged medical negligence cases. The fresh directive has fuelled concerns that it would make doctors more vulnerable to attacks as aprons would make it easier to identify and target them.Senior doctors argue that aprons would do little to address core issues like excessively long working hours and rush of patients.The latest brawl unfolded on July 22 at Srinagar’s SMHS Hospital. CCTV footage shows a local, identified as Abid Hussain Bhat, slapping Shahnawaz, a resident doctor from UP who is reportedly physically challenged, causing the latter to fall to the ground. Bhat alleged negligence in treatment of his deceased brother-in-law.As doctors, interns, and staff protested the attack, a local woman journalist, Sufi Hidayah, alleged that she was harassed while covering the demonstration. “My only aim was to know what had happened with Dr. Shahnawaz and hear his side of the story as medical negligence allegations were dominating the media. As I approached him, a group of doctors surrounded and manhandled me. Some pulled at my clothes. Even the principal of GMC (inside SMHS) pushed me,” Hidayah said.Health minister Sakeena ordered Saturday an inquiry into the row and asked for a report within 15 days.

J&K set to create ripples with ‘hydropower tourism’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-set-to-create-ripples-with-hydropower-tourism/articleshow/122926830.cms,"Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (Pic credit: PTI)

SRINAGAR: J&K’s Omar-Abdullah-led government has started dipping its toes in “hydropower tourism” with plans to allow hydel electricity generators to set up on-site tourism facilities as an incentive to attract more investors into such projects.J&K’s Draft Hydro Power Policy, 2025, proposes tourism infrastructure in hydel projects up to 25MW. A senior official said the infrastructure could include hotels, parks, guesthouses, and water sports facilities The draft policy, reviewed earlier this week by chief minister Omar, will soon be released for public feedback.The policy assumes significance after the Centre put Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan in abeyance following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Omar’s National Conference (NC) has long opposed IWT, calling it detrimental to J&K’s interests and arguing that it ceded control of river waters to Pakistan without consulting the region.Such tourism facilities will be allowed to be set up only after hydel projects up to 25MW go on stream. “The policy clearly says after the main hydropower project is completed and begins operating, they can apply to build tourism infrastructure.The aim is to increase income and support local economic growth,” the official said.The incentive has been limited for projects up to 25 MW as they typically come up on small streams and offer good tourism potential, while larger hydel plants are located on major rivers with little scope for ancillary amenities, the official explained. J&K has an estimated hydropower potential of over 20,000MW but less than 15% is harnessed.Govt expects good response to the new policy. The official cited Ranjit Sagar Dam (also known as Thein Dam) at Pathankot in neighbouring Punjab as an example, pointing out that the area, with lush gardens and scenic surroundings, had turned into a popular picnic destination. “J&K’s upcoming hydropower projects offer similar tourism potential,” the official said.While hydropower developers in J&K will be required to provide 12% of the generated electricity free to the Union territory under the new policy, the obligation will remain suspended during the initial years to ease the burden on developers.Developers will be allowed to retain all tourism revenue from the start, without no sharing with govt. However, after 40 years, developers must hand over the “hydel project” and “all related tourism infrastructure in good operating condition” to govt.The draft policy categorises projects into two segments, up to 25MW, and between 25MW and 100 MW. It proposes waiver of water usage charges for all projects, classifying them as “non-consumptive users”. Developers will also benefit from carbon credit incentives and receive 100% exemption on registration fees and stamp duty on land purchases, leases, or mortgages related to the projects.","J&K’s Draft Hydro Power Policy, 2025, proposes tourism infrastructure in hydel projects up to 25MW.

Kerala jailbreak: Officials clueless on how Govindachamy escaped Kannur prison; photo shows him hiding in well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/govindachamy-escapes-from-prison-caught-hours-later/articleshow/122912391.cms,"Jail officials clueless

Poll Do you believe that prison security measures are adequate to prevent jailbreaks? Yes No





KANNUR: Govindachamy alias Charley Thomas, convicted of rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in 2011, escaped from the high-security block of the Kannur Central Prison early on Friday. The 41-year-old life convict, whose left hand is amputated, was apprehended by police within hours. He was found hiding inside a well on the premises of National Sample Survey Office at Thalap, police said.Kannur city police commissioner P Nithin Raj said the jailbreak occurred between 4.15 and 6.30am. Jail authorities discovered his absence during a morning inspection, after assistant prison officer trainees, who were out training, found clothes hanging from the prison wall along the national highway.Govindachamy had cut through the iron bars of his cell using a bar cutter and fashioned a rope out of cloth and bedsheets, police said.Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance. The six-metre wall of the prison is topped with an electric fence, which is believed to have been non-functional at the time. Three prison officers on duty at the time have been suspended following a preliminary inquiry that found lapses on their part.Police launched a statewide manhunt soon after, and apprehended Govindachamy following a tip-off from a local resident, Vinoj, who spotted him in Thalap in the morning. ""I was riding my two-wheeler when I noticed a man walking slowly on the left side of the road. He looked like a beggar, and we exchanged glances briefly. I had already heard about Govindachamy's escape from prison, and something about the man I saw made me suspicious. .. When I called out his name, he immediately bolted into a narrow lane and jumped over the compound wall of an under-construction building,"" Vinoj said.Police later confirmed his identity after reviewing CCTV footage from the area. Based on this, a large contingent of officers, along with residents, intensified the search. A dog squad was also deployed. M Unnikrishnan, a NSSO staffer, spotted the convict in the well while inspecting the premises. Police, assisted by residents, apprehended Govindachamy.He was then taken to the Kannur town station and, after a medical examination, brought to the central prison for evidence collection. He was produced before the Kannur judicial first class magistrate court and remanded in custody for 14 days. He is likely to be shifted to the Viyyur high-security prison in Thrissur.Govindachamy is a native of Virudhachalam in Tamil Nadu. The 2011 case had shocked the nation and sparked a debate over women's safety on public transport. The victim, who was travelling alone on a passenger train from Ernakulam to Shoranur, was pushed out of the moving train and raped on the railway track. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital.","Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha.

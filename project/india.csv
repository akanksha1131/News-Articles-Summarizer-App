Despite ongoing security assistance for Ukraine and support for Israel’s territorial defense, he confirmed that the US remains dedicated to Indo-Pacific stability.""We strengthened Nato. We've pulled Nato together.

"Ratan Tata made India a better, kinder and more hopeful place: Narendra Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ratan-tata-made-india-a-better-kinder-and-more-hopeful-place-prime-minister-narendra-modi/articleshow/115101491.cms,"- Prime Minister

It has been a month since Ratan Tata left us. From bustling cities and towns to villages, his absence is being deeply felt across every segment of society. Seasoned industrialists, budding entrepreneurs and hardworking professionals are mourning his loss. Those passionate about the environment and devoted to philanthropy are equally saddened. His absence has been deeply felt not only across the nation but also around the world.For the youth, Tata was an inspiration, a reminder that dreams are worth pursuing and that success can coexist with compassion as well as humility. For others, he represented the finest traditions of Indian enterprise and a steadfast commitment to the values of integrity, excellence and service.Under his leadership, the Tata Group scaled new heights, embodying respect, honesty and credibility worldwide. Despite this, he wore his achievements lightly, with humility and kindness.Tata's unwavering support for the dreams of others was one of his most defining qualities. In recent years, he became known for mentoring India's StartUp ecosystem, investing in many promising ventures. He understood the hopes and aspirations of young entrepreneurs and recognised the potential they had to shape India's future. By backing their efforts, he empowered a generation of dreamers to take bold risks and push boundaries. This has gone a long way in creating a culture ofinnovation and entrepreneurship, which I am confident will continue to positively impact India for decades to come.He constantly championed excellence, urging Indian enterprises to set global benchmarks. This vision, I hope, will inspire our future leaders to make India synonymous with world-class quality.His greatness was not restricted to the boardroom or helping fellow humans. His compassion extended to all living beings. His deep love for animals was well-known and he supported every possible effort focused on animal welfare. He often shared photos of his dogs, who were as much a part of his life as any business venture. His life was a reminder to us all that true leadership is measured not just by one's achievements, but by one's ability to care for the most vulnerable.For crores of Indians, Tata's patriotism shone brightest in times of crisis. His swift reopening of the iconic Taj Hotel in Mumbai after the 26/11 terror attacks was a rallying call to the nation - India stands united, refusing to yield to terrorism.On a personal note, I had the privilege of knowing him very closely over the years. We worked closely in Gujarat, where he invested extensively, including in many projects he was very passionate about. Just a few weeks ago, I was in Vadodara with the President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, and we jointly inaugurated an aircraft complex where C-295 aircraft would be made in India. It was Tata who started working on this. Needless to say, Tata's presence was greatly missed.I remember Tata would frequently write to me on various issues, be it matters of governance, expressing appreciation for government support, or sending congratulatory wishes after electoral victories.Our close interactions continued when I moved to the Centre and he remained a committed partner in our nation-building efforts. Tata's support for the Swachh Bharat Mission was particularly close to my heart. He was a vocal advocate of this mass movement, understanding that cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation are vital for India's progress. I still remember his heartfelt video message for the Swachh Bharat Mission's tenth anniversary at the start of October. It was among his final public appearances.Another cause close to his heart was healthcare, especially the fight against cancer. I recall a programme in Assam two years ago where we had jointly inaugurated various cancer hospitals in the state. In his remarks at that time, he had categorically stated that he wished to dedicate his final years to healthcare. His efforts to make health and cancer care accessible and affordable were rooted in a profound empathy for those battling diseases, believing that a just society was one that stood by its most vulnerable.As we remember him today, we are reminded of the society he envisioned - where business can serve as a force for good, where every individual's potential is valued and where progress is measured in the well-being and happiness of all. He remains alive in the lives he touched and the dreams he nurtured. Generations will be grateful to him for making India a better, kinder and more hopeful place.","Prime Minister: Ratan Tata's absence is being deeply felt across every segment of society.

November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations. After the lively Diwali celebrations on October 31, students get to enjoy several important religious holidays in the beginning of November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations.

NEW DELHI: As opposition continued to target the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's slogan '' (will be slaughtered, if divided), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday gave a new pitch in Maharashtra -- '' (We are safe, only if united).Accusing the Congress of pitting one caste against another, PM Modi in an election rally in Dhule asked people to stay united, saying "".”“The sole agenda of the Congress party is to make one caste fight against another. They do not want SCs, STs and OBCs to progress and get their due recognition … Remember, ‘',"" he said.PM' new slogan comes amid row over Yogi Adityanath's '' pitch. The expression was first used by the UP CM at a rally in Agra in the backdrop of Hindu minorities being subjected to violence in Bangladesh. Later, PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also made similar pitches for Hindu unity later. During his annual Vijaya Dashami speech this year, Bhagwat said that ""being unorganised and weak is like inviting atrocities by the wicked"".Yogi Adityanath had also repeated the slogan during an election rally in Maharashtra while campaigning for ruling-Mahayuti.In his first campaign rally in Maharashtra for the upcoming November 20 assembly elections, PM Modi opened an all-front attack on Congress and stated that since Nehru's era, the party and his family has opposed reservation, and now their fourth generation 'yuvraj' [Rahul Gandhi] is promoting caste divisions.“Since Nehru's time Congress and his family opposed reservation and now their fourth generation ‘yuvraj' (prince) is working for caste divisions,” Modi said.He alleged that the Congress-led INDIA bloc sought to remove the Constitution from Jammu and Kashmir, whilst firmly stating that Article 370's restoration was impossible under any circumstances.The Prime Minister also accused the coalition of misleading Dalits and Adivasis by presenting blank books as the Constitution.He cautioned Congress and its allies against promoting ""Pakistan agenda"" or using separatist rhetoric, asserting that such efforts would fail as long as he had public support.""Only Ambedkar's constitution will be followed in J&K. You must have seen on TV how a resolution was moved in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on bringing back Article 370 and when BJP MLAs protested, they were thrown out. The country and Maharashtra should understand this,"" Modi said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday accused the BJP of having some ""rotten thoughts"" for believing in ''.""The BJP has some rotten thoughts, it believes in '',"" Kharge had said while addressing an election rally in Ranchi.Meanwhile, NCP chief Ajit Pawar indirectly distanced himself from UP CM's slogan saying that people from 'outside' make such statements, but Maharashtra has always maintained communal harmony. ""Nobody should compare Maharashtra with the other states. People here have always ensured communal harmony. Some from outside come here and make statements, but Maharashtra has never accepted any communal division. The state follows the secular ideology of Shahu (Maharaj), (Jyotiba) Phule, and (Babasaheb) Ambedkar,"" he said.","PM' new slogan comes amid row over Yogi Adityanath's '' pitch.

MUMBAI: While the focus is on the daily jousting for the Maharashtra elections, there are subtle moves being made to mobilise the Hindu vote in BJP and Mahayuti's favour. In its own 'woke' moment - not of the kind seen on US campuses or in 'liberal' corridors but of the right-wing conception - the RSS has, through more than 65 friendly organisations, launched a campaign called 'Sajag Raho' ('Be Vigilant, Be Awake') in Maharashtra, which is intended not only to bolster BJP's push in the assembly polls but as a pushback against what it sees as ""a larger attempt to keep Hindus divided and further atomise them,"" with repercussions going beyond politics.'Sajag Raho' is the newest addition to the three-line national chorus by Hindutva forces after the LS polls and the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh: the 'Batenge toh katenge' remark of Yogi Adityanath, PM Modi's comment of 'Ek hai toh safe hain' on Friday in Dhule (where BJP-RSS say consolidation of Muslim votes in Malegaon led to the narrow defeat of the BJP candidate in the LS polls), and Yogi's comment again in Maharashtra's Washim of 'Ek hai toh nek hain', the 'nek' there meaning, according to the Parivar, ""Hindus will stay noble and not be forced to resort to violence, if only for self-defence, if they are not divided.""Sangh sources though said 'Sajag Raho' and 'Ek hai ho safe hai' are not aimed against anyone but at eliminating caste divisions among Hindus. A senior BJP functionary said ""hundreds of meetings"" are being organised by RSS 'swayamsevaks' and 65-plus NGOs to convey the message. Though Maharashtra polls are the immediate objective, the campaign, according to Parivar sources, represents the stirrings of an ideological and intellectual response to a larger phenomenon where Hindus get splintered on caste lines while Muslims bury differences and coalesce into a solid voting bloc, fired by the objective of seeing the BJP's back.Among groups involved in the campaign are Chanakya Prathisthan, Matang Sahitya Parishad and Ranragini Sevabhavi Sanstha. All the four Sangh 'prants' or regional divisions across Maharashtra - Konkan (including Mumbai and Goa), Devgiri (Marathwada), Paschim (western) Maharashtra (which includes Nashik and parts of northern Maharashtra), and Vidarbha (where RSS has headquarters) - are involved in the campaign, organising meetings at the shakha level.One of the campaign's highlights is the citing of the Dhule Lok Sabha and Mumbai North East Lok Sabha seat outcome as examples. It refers to what the Sangh calls the 'Malegaon model', which, according to it, hurt a 'divided' Hindu community. Social worker Girish Prabhune, a Padma Shri awardee for his work with the Pardhi community who is among those holding meetings, said, ""BJP's defeat in Dhule was systematically planned. Though Congress's Shobha Bachchav won by 5,117 votes, she got a lead in just one assembly segment. BJP's Subhash Bhamre got a lead of 1,89,210 from five assembly segments. But in one segment, Malegaon Central, he got just 4,542 votes and the Congress candidate got a lead of 1,94,327 votes from there, because of which she won the seat."" Malegaon Central is a minority-dominated assembly segment.The meetings being held are with RSS-BJP sympathisers and other voters who may or may not be inclined to vote BJP. They focus on three points: Hindutva and impact of votebank politics on elections, the alleged influx of Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims and its implications on electoral politics, and ""the vendetta politics that will revisit not only BJP and RSS but Hindu society as a whole if minority consolidation is allowed to have its way,"" a senior RSS member said.RSS is not officially owning up to the campaign as an organisation but is simply calling it ""an initiative by swayamsevaks"". ""Swayamsevaks have taken the lead to tell Hindu society it should not be divided on basis of caste, especially at a time when the Maratha-OBC divide has deepened in the state,"" said an RSS functionary.However, a BJP functionary said the campaign has been ""ideated and executed by RSS, it is oriented towards BJP's electoral prospects in Maharashtra and beyond, and it has its own logo and steering committee.""Asked if 'Sajag Raho' represented another way of putting across the 'Batenge toh katenge' message, Devendra Pai, assistant professor of political science at University of Delhi and formerly a key member of RSS think tank Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini, said Maharashtra and Mumbai in particular had an audience for both slogans. ""Both will find resonance, maybe in different places and among different sections,"" he said.Sources said the urgency of the campaign is underlined by the fact that RSS feels Maharashtra is important not only from the usual 'financial and industrial powerhouse' perspective but because, as one of the most advanced states, ""Maharashtra gets to define what is progress and what is progressive."" ""To have control over the narrative around progress and progressiveness is critical especially for a party that openly upholds traditional values,"" the RSS functionary said. This ideological aspect is key to BJP retaining Maharashtra.","The RSS has, through more than 65 friendly organisations, launched a campaign called 'Sajag Raho' ('Be Vigilant, Be Awake') in Maharashtra. The campaign is intended not only to bolster BJP's push in the assembly polls but as a pushback against what it sees as ""a larger attempt to keep Hindus divided and further atomise them""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115095970,imgsize-1735403,width-400,resizemode-4/115095970.jpg"

Challenges and Limitations of an Electoral College for India



Disproportionate Representation:

Winner-Takes-All System Risks:

Encourages Strategic Targeting:

Potential for Electoral College Deadlock:

In the United States, the Electoral College system plays a pivotal role in presidential elections. Each state is allocated a specific number of electoral votes based on its population, and most states follow a winner-takes-all approach, where the candidate with the majority vote secures all of the state's electoral votes. This system means that winning populous states like California, Texas, and Florida is crucial for a candidate's success. For instance, California, with its 55 electoral votes—the highest of any state—has been a significant factor in determining election outcomes.Imagine if India, with its diverse and populous states, adopted a similar Electoral College system for its general elections. How would key states like Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra, and West Bengal, known for their significant populations, impact the results? In such a model, securing the majority vote in a few large states could potentially change the entire outcome, making India’s federal elections more strategic and less about direct popular support. With that in mind, let’s explore what India’s 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections might look like if they were held under an Electoral College system similar to that of the US.The US Electoral College is a unique voting mechanism used to elect the President. Each state is assigned a specific number of electoral votes based on its population size, with larger states receiving more votes. In nearly every state, the candidate who wins the majority of votes claims all the electoral votes for that state—a “winner-takes-all” approach. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure more than half of the total 538 electoral votes nationally. This system prioritises victories in populous and diverse states, as winning these larger prizes is essential for an overall majority.India’s electoral process for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) follows the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. In each constituency, the candidate who receives the most votes wins a seat, regardless of the percentage of total votes. The party or coalition that wins the majority of Lok Sabha seats forms the government. Unlike the US, every individual vote counts towards a single national result, often allowing one party or coalition to gain dominance with only a plurality, rather than an absolute majority, of the popular vote.To estimate India’s election results under an Electoral College model, we assigned each state a number of “electoral votes” equivalent to its Lok Sabha seats, as they are already based on state populations. This produced a total of 543 electoral votes. For simplicity, states were categorized as either going to the NDA (BJP-led coalition) or to the opposition based on the highest vote share. Here, the NDA would receive all of a state’s electoral votes if it held the majority of the vote share there, and all other votes would go to the “Others” category, representing opposition alliances and regional parties.In the actual 2014 election, the NDA led by BJP swept the country, winning 336 of the 543 seats. Under an Electoral College system:337 electoral votes182 electoral votesThe winner-takes-all system would have amplified the NDA’s victory, giving it a higher electoral total than under FPTP due to its dominance in populous states.In 2019, the NDA further solidified its position, winning 353 seats. Under an Electoral College model:355 electoral votes164 electoral votesThe electoral vote outcome would again favor the NDA significantly. The swing in NDA's favor in key states would secure it a majority, increasing its winning margin relative to the FPTP model.In 2024, the NDA secured 293 seats, while the opposition alliance INDIA won 234 seats. Under an Electoral College system:342 electoral votes177 electoral votesDespite a reduced seat count compared to 2019, the NDA would still maintain a majority in the Electoral College, highlighting the impact of winning populous states under this system.Here’s a breakdown of how this might look:BJP won 282 seats on its own. In an Electoral College model, BJP would win the entire set of electoral votes from each state where it had the majority vote share in 2014.Approximately 312 electoral votesBJP increased its solo count to 303 seats. Under the Electoral College model, it would likely secure the majority vote in several key populous states, especially those it carried comfortably in 2019.: Approximately 325 electoral votesWith BJP winning 260 seats on its own, some populous states might still go to the BJP due to its coalition, even if it lost some solo ground. However, the reduced solo seat count would reflect a tighter margin in key states.: Approximately 300 electoral votesThese estimates assume that BJP secured majority support in key populous states in each respective year. The hypothetical model suggests that the Electoral College system would still amplify BJP’s wins in populous states, translating to a higher electoral vote count compared to their Lok Sabha seats, particularly in 2014 and 2019.If all opposition votes were consolidated against BJP in a US-style Electoral College model, the election results would be notably different, especially in 2014, 2019, and 2024. In 2014, BJP would secure approximately 270 electoral votes, while the consolidated opposition would win around 273, narrowly flipping the majority to the opposition. In 2019, BJP would still win a majority with approximately 285 electoral votes to the opposition’s 258, though by a slimmer margin than in the actual FPTP system. By 2024, however, a unified opposition would clearly prevail, with around 293 electoral votes to BJP’s 250. This scenario illustrates how a consolidated opposition could effectively challenge BJP’s dominance, especially in more closely contested election years.While the Electoral College model might provide new insights, it poses several challenges if applied to India:Like the US, an Electoral College could overrepresent populous states, making regional powerhouses less influential. This might disadvantage smaller states and potentially overlook regional diversity in representation.This approach could lead to substantial disenfranchisement of votes in states where parties lose narrowly. It would discount the voices of voters who supported other parties but lost by a small margin, potentially reducing faith in the electoral process.Candidates may focus their resources on high-electoral states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra , neglecting the needs and voices of smaller or less populated regions. This focus could lead to uneven development and political emphasis across states.With a multiparty system and strong regional alliances, India could face a higher likelihood of electoral deadlocks. In the US, the two-party system streamlines the Electoral College outcome, whereas India’s coalition-based structure would make the process far more complicated and potentially lead to drawn-out election results.Though intriguing as a theoretical exercise, an Electoral College in India would likely lead to challenges in maintaining equitable representation across the country. It might benefit large coalitions but would risk undermining regional voices. By examining the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections through this lens, it’s clear that the current FPTP system, despite its imperfections, aligns more closely with India’s federal structure and pluralistic society.","India’s electoral process for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) follows the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system.

CEC warns of action if parties and netas make anti-women remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-warns-of-action-if-parties-and-netas-make-anti-women-remarks/articleshow/115096009.cms,"MUMBAI: In a review meeting on the Maharashtra assembly polls on Friday, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar strongly condemned undignified remarks made against female leaders during the election campaign.This comes in the wake of derogatory language used against Congress leader Jayshree Thorat by BJP politician Vasant Deshmukh in a public meeting and also comments made by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Arvind Sawant about Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC. Both incidents resulted in cases being lodged.Kumar urged political parties and candidates to refrain from any utterances or actions that may be construed as being repugnant to the honour and dignity of women. He told state officials that any remarks by candidates or political leaders which insulted the dignity of women and violated the model code of conduct should be met with stern action.Last week, NCP chief Sharad Pawar alleged that police vehicles were being used to transport cash to Mahayuti candidates. In response, Maharashtra's chief electoral officer S Chockalingam said that the district collectors were given strict instructions to prevent this.On Friday, Kumar also stated that there should be strict vigilance to prevent any possibility of misuse of govt vehicles like ambulances and vans for circulating cash and valuables. He also emphasised the need for a strict watch with night patrolling, especially during the silence period, and a strict vigil on attempts to offer inducements like cash, liquor, drugs or freebies to influence voters.Meanwhile, Kumar also urged state officials to try and enhance voter participation , especially in urban areas. He questioned why voters in regions like Bastar (68%) and Gadchiroli (78%) could come out and vote, but Colaba and Kalyan could not. Colaba in 2019 recorded only 40% voting, he said.In J&K, constituencies like Doda, Reasi, Poonch, and Rajouri all recorded turnout exceeding 70% in the recent assembly polls. Sensitive areas like Manipur recorded 78% turnout in the Lok Sabha polls. However, one of the constituencies in Mumbai South saw close to half of eligible electors skipping voting altogether, he noted. Kumar also mentioned some high-rises in Gurgaon and Faridabad saw a turnout of 20% even when polling stations were set up in their society buildings in the Haryana elections.","Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar strongly condemned undignified remarks made against female leaders.

Landmark judgements



NEW DELHI: The outgoing Chief Justice of India got emotional on his last working day on Friday and reflected on his tenure saying ""there is no greater feeling than being able to serve those in need"".CJI Chandrachud will retire on November 10 but today was his last official working day.A ceremonial four-judge bench convened to bid farewell, including CJI-designate Sanjiv Khanna, Justices J B Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra. The CJI conveyed profound satisfaction for his accomplishments and the privilege of serving the nation.""You asked me what keeps me going. It is this court which has kept me going because there is not a single day when you feel that you have not learned something, that you have not had an opportunity to serve the society,"" a teary-eyed CJI said.""And there is no greater feeling than being able to serve those in need and the people you would never meet, people you possibly do not even know, people whose lives you have the ability to affect without ever having seen them,"" he added.Following in the footsteps of his distinguished father YV Chandrachud, who served as CJI from 1978 to 1985, he assumed office on November 9, 2022.CJI-designate Khanna, along with prominent legal figures including the attorney general, solicitor general, and SCBA president Kapil Sibal, offered heartfelt tributes to mark this significant moment in India's judicial history.In his farewell speech, CJI Chandrachud shared his progression from being a law student seated in the back row to presiding over the Supreme Court . He emphasised the honour of serving the nation, noting how each day provided opportunities for professional and personal development.""I was always aware of the overpowering presence of the greats of this court and the responsibility that came with sitting in this chair. But at the end of the day, it is not about the individual, it is about the institution and the cause of justice we uphold here,"" the CJI stated.He praised his colleagues, particularly noting his collaboration with Justices Pardiwala and Misra, acknowledging how their varied perspectives enhanced their collective work.The CJI expressed confidence in Justice Khanna's future leadership, describing his successor as ""dignified, stable and deeply committed to justice"".In his closing remarks, CJI Chandrachud thanked everyone who contributed to his journey, from senior advocates to staff members. He also sought forgiveness for any inadvertent mistakes, saying, ""If I have ever hurt anyone, I seek your forgiveness.""Justice Khanna commended the CJI, noting, ""He has made my task easy and tough. Easy because of the revolutions ushered in and tough because I cannot walk up to him. He will be sorely missed. His youthfulness is not known here only but also abroad. In Australia, there were so many who came to me and asked what his age was.""Sibal characterised the CJI as ""the extraordinary son of an extraordinary father"".""I have practised in this court for 52 years now and in my life, I have never seen a judge with the kind of limitless patience that you have, the ever-smiling Dr Chandrachud,"" the SCBA president remarked.""What can I say about you as a human being and you as a judge? As a judge, your conduct was exemplary. No one can match it. You reached out to communities in this country who were never heard before, who were not seen before. You brought them before you and showed what dignity meant for them,"" he added.""Be it liberty, be it fraternity, be it life, be it the life of ordinary, marginalised challenged people, you have, unlike your father, dealt with this court when the court was tumultuous. You have dealt with the court when matters were tumultuous. You took them head on, unafraid of the consequences. Your greatest legacy to this court that there will be none like you...,"" he stated.Former attorney general KK Venugopal shared, ""When your father asked me should I advise him (Justice Chandrachud) to continue at the bar or take judgeship, I said he is a great lawyer and let him continue in the same. But you took up judgeship and thank god. If you had listened to me, then we would have lost such a great judge.""Born on November 11, 1959, Justice Chandrachud has achieved notable success in the judiciary.His cricket enthusiasm began in his youth, when he played in his father's Lutyens' Delhi residence backyard.The Bombay high court designated him as a senior advocate in June 1998. He served as additional solicitor general before his appointment as a Bombay High Court judge on March 29, 2000. He later became the Allahabad High Court's chief justice on October 31, 2013.Justice Chandrachud earned a BA in Economics from Delhi's St Stephen's College, an LLB from Delhi University's Campus Law Centre, and an LLM and Doctorate in Juridical Sciences (SJD) from Harvard Law School.Throughout his two-year tenure, CJI Chandrachud delivered numerous landmark judgments. A notable ruling came from the Constitution Bench he headed, which validated the abrogation of some clauses of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.In another crucial verdict, he maintained the existing Special Marriage Act framework, choosing not to extend it to same-sex marriages, leaving this matter for parliamentary consideration. Nevertheless, he strongly affirmed the LGBTQ+ community's fundamental rights to dignity and protection from discrimination.His tenure culminated in a significant ruling that abolished the electoral bonds scheme, establishing stricter requirements for transparency in political funding and directing the State Bank of India to stop issuing electoral bonds.","CJI Chandrachud will retire on November 10 but today was his last official working day.

NEW DELHI: In an eyebrow-raising proposal aimed at safeguarding women, the Uttar Pradesh state women’s commission has suggested a ban on male tailors measuring women and male barbers styling women’s hair. The recommendation, which advocates for a female-only rule in tailoring and salons, is aimed at curbing instances of ""bad touch"" and discouraging ""ill intentions"" from male professionals, according to the commission.The proposal was made during a meeting on October 28, where women’s commission chairperson Babita Chauhan led the discussion, gaining support from the attending members. Himani Agarwal, a commission member, disclosed the details of the suggestion on Friday, as reported by PTI.""At the meeting, we proposed that only female tailors should take women’s measurements and that CCTV cameras should be installed in these areas to ensure women’s safety,"" Agarwal said. ""In salons, only female barbers should attend to female clients."" She explained that such restrictions could help prevent inappropriate behavior, adding, ""Some men in these professions do not have good intentions, which can lead to molestation.""Agarwal clarified that the intent isn’t to paint all men as predatory but to address specific instances where women have felt uncomfortable. ""Not all men have bad intentions,"" she said, acknowledging the potential sensitivities surrounding the proposal.Currently, the commission is in the early stages of pushing this idea and plans to appeal to the state government to consider formal legislation. While the proposal has sparked discussions on the necessity and practicality of such restrictions, the commission believes this measure could create a safer environment for women in Uttar Pradesh.","UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair.

The situation escalated when allegations surfaced that the CID had launched an investigation into the incident. However, both the chief minister and the authorities have denied these allegations.“There is no such thing... It (CID) got involved in the issue of misbehavior,” Himachal CM Sukhu told news agency ANI.The deputy general of CID, Sanjeev Ranjan Ojha also said that it was an internal matter of the CID and should not become a matter of poltics.""This is completely an internal matter of the CID. It should not be politicised. The CM does not eat samosas... We have not given notice to anyone. We have just said to find out what happened. The government has nothing to do with this... We will find out how this information was leaked,"" he said.The controversy snowballed after the CM's visit to the CID headquarters on October 21, where refreshments intended for him were wrongly served to his security detail. According to news agency PTI, the mix-up began when an Inspector General (IG) asked for refreshments, delegating the task to a sub-inspector (SI), who then passed it to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a head constable. The officers collected the sealed snack boxes and informed the SI, who was the only one aware that they were meant for the chief minister. However, further confusion led to the snacks being taken to the mechanical transport (MT) section, where they were mistakenly served to the security staff.This incident did not go down well with the BJP as Jairam Thakur questioned why it was labeled an ""anti-government"" activity.Earlier in the day, Jairam Thakur said, ""Nowadays, the way the government takes decisions in Himachal Pradesh has become a topic of discussion in the whole country because decisions are taken without thinking. Now another topic that is being discussed is that the samosas did not reach where they should have reached, they got lost in the middle and the Chief Minister and the Himachal Pradesh government felt that this is a very serious matter and an investigation should be done on this"".","BJP leader Jairam Thakur hosted a samosa party with BJP workers at the Circuit House in Mandi.

""After seeing how matters unfolded, my admiration for Anil Deshmukh (NCP SCP leader) and Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT leader) increased manifold. Despite being jailed, they stood their ground and did not give in to pressure,"" Supriya added. Recalling her meeting with some NCP 'rebels' at Devgiri bungalow, Ajit Pawar's official residence in Mumbai, just before her cousin and the others, took their oaths on July 2, 2023, Supriya said that six current ministers of Ajit Pawar's party had denied they were joining Mahayuti when they spoke to her.""I spoke to at least 20 people. I kept asking them, but nobody was honest with me. They kept denying that they were joining Mahayuti. There were six senior MLAs among these 20 who later took their oaths,"" she said.This is the first assembly election for Supriya as her party's working president after the NCP split. With only ten days of campaigning, she spent Friday visiting seven constituencies, participating in rallies, marches and meetings to campaign for MVA candidates in Pune.She said, ""I have travelled to various districts, and the response to MVA is quite good. People are suffering from inflation, unemployment, rising crime, and the agrarian crisis. But this govt is busy with vendetta politics which people rejected in the Lok Sabha poll, and will do so in the assembly election too."" On the possibility of an alliance with the BJP, Supriya said those who left the party were pushing party chief Sharad Pawar to join it, but he chose not to go with them.She said, ""Before switching sides, those members were pursuing Pawar Saheb to join hands with the BJP. However, he was clear right from the beginning that he would not join them and told them to make their own decisions. We also have differences with them on some serious policy issues.""The NCP (SCP) working president said, ""Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Devendra Fadnavis have let the country and state down. They levelled serious allegations against us, calling the NCP Naturally Corrupt Party. They attempted to tarnish our reputation, and then they took half our party with them. Now, they will have to make up their minds on which NCP they have aligned with - the Nationalist Congress Party or the Naturally Corrupt Party.""The MP also claimed that the BJP did not spare her family members. ""My cousins Vijaya Patil, Neeta Patil, and Rajani Indulkar's residences were raided by central agencies. They have no connection to politics, but this is how the invisible power, which uses agencies to create fear in the minds of people, works.""She said her father is a fighter. ""When he was threatened with an ED notice, he got up and said, ""I will come to you instead of you coming to my house.' Everybody deals with issues in different ways. There is a lot to say, but it is not necessary to bring everything out in public,"" she said.On her possibility of becoming the chief minister, a post her father held four times, Supriya said, ""Our politics is very different. If I and Ajit Pawar have to compare ourselves with him (Pawar), we will have to cry into our pillows. Ajit Pawar at least has publicly accepted that he aspires to be the CM.

However, they didn't expect a battery-run camera to expose what they thought was a perfect plan. After investigation by security agency heads, a complaint was filed against the 11 with Sanand police.The complaint was filed by Vijay Kushwaha, 48, a resident of Hansol, and an employee of the security agency which provided the guards to Varuna Electrics in Sanand GIDC, which manufactures submersible pumps.On Nov 5, the company's chief security officer Vishwanath Singh called up Kushwaha telling him that 21 submersible pumps had been stolen from the unit.According to the complaint, the security agency's regional head Praharash Vachhrajani and investigation head, Zakir Khan, began an inquiry into the theft. Their investigation found that the unit had 71 pumps on its premises before it closed on Oct 30, a day before Diwali.When the factory reopened on Nov 5, 21 were missing. When the agency heads tried accessing CCTV footage, they found that on Nov 1, all cameras had been switched off around 3.40am and were switched back on around 5.30am, the police complaint states.There was no headway until it was found that a battery-operated CCTV camera had captured one of the security guards, named Mahendra Dabhi, stealing a box containing a submersible pump.

NEW DELHI: Central and state law agencies engaged in the fight against terror on Friday agreed on the need to shift towards firmer and more collaborative efforts, backed by a standardised strategy, to counter terrorism in all its forms, particularly cybercrime and financial terrorism .At the end of a two-day anti-terror conference organised by NIA in New Delhi , there was broad consensus that Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, though a powerful legal tool to tackle terror, should be invoked carefully and judiciously to avoid potential misuse and to retain its effectiveness in combating terrorism.The participants, comprising 39 heads of central and state police entities and 150 delegates from across the country, concurred on the need for a holistic and well-rounded strategy to deal with terrorism, encompassing the country's entire counter-terror framework extending from govt down to the police station level.In his concluding remarks, home secretary Govind Mohan urged state police forces to engage in capacity-building to effectively combat terrorism. He urged states to send competent officers to NIA, and added that this would not only help steer the agency's growth but also enrich the investigation culture back home when these officers return to their state cadre.NIA will be conducting several more capacity building sessions for states, he announced, adding that more NFSU campuses and CFSLs were also in the pipeline to promote the quality of digital evidence and secure conviction in terror cases.While underlining the role of Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) in dealing with financial-and cyber-related crimes in a coordinated manner, Mohan echoed home minister Amit Shah's views on the need for all police and investigative agencies and forces to share information in real time.Participants engaged in thematic sessions on topics like 'prosecution and evolving legal framework in counter-terror (CT) investigations', 'significant case studies in terror investigations', 'emerging technologies', 'dismantling terror ecosystem' and 'comprehensive CT strategies'.The police heads called for global cooperation to tackle the misuse of social media by terrorists amid divergent content moderation policies. The session on case studies in terror investigations discussed the Rameshwaram Cafe blast probe, in which central agencies and various state police forces had worked together to crack the case.

HC: Formulate policy to absorb anganwadi staff in government service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-formulate-policy-to-absorb-anganwadi-staff-in-government-service/articleshow/115098775.cms,"AHMEDABAD: In an important judgment that could benefit 1.06 lakh women in Gujarat and over 24 lakh women across the country, the Gujarat high court has ruled that anganwadi workers (AWWs) and anganwadi helpers (AWHs) are entitled to be absorbed as ""permanent employees holding civil posts"" in the central or the state govts.Justice Nikhil Kariel directed the Centre and the state govt to jointly formulate a policy for the absorption of AWWs and AWHs in govt services and to confer the consequential benefit of regularisation of their jobs under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), a centrally sponsored scheme. Their absorption in the govt service in Gujarat was ordered under the Gujarat Civil Services (Classification and Recruitment) (General) Rules, 1967.The HC further ordered the consideration of the salary of AWWs and AWHs in the minimum pay scale as available to Class 3 and Class 4 posts, respectively. The govt was also ordered to pay arrears, and in the case of the petitioners, the cut-off date will be three years preceding the date of filing the petitions, which was in 2015. This is because the women working in these positions are paid an honorarium, Rs 10,000 to AWWs and Rs 5,500 to AWHs, which is much less than a Class 4 employee working in such a category for four hours a day.The HC in its order directed the Centre and the state govt to complete the exercise of forming the policy within six months from the date of uploading the judgment on the HC's portal, which happened last week. In its order, the HC further directed that until the govts take an appropriate decision in this regard, the petitioners are entitled to a salary in the minimum pay scale in Class 3 and Class 4 posts.The HC's directions are in response to hundreds of petitions filed in 2015 by AWWs and AWHs working for over 10 years and seeking regularisation in service and minimum wages . The women working in these posts claimed discrimination and exploitation and urged the court to hold that the system of employing them under the ICDS scheme on an honorarium is in violation of the constitutional provisions.The HC noted in its order that ""discrimination of AWWs and AWHs vis-a-vis govt employees, is writ large on the face of the functions, duties and responsibilities of the AWWs and AWHs as compared to the emoluments paid to the AWWs and AWHs."" The HC further stated in its order that these women are paid very little considering the fact that an AWW is required to work as a paramedic, a counsellor, a coordinator, a public relations manager, an event manager, a clerk, a pre-school teacher, and more. They are also required to attend the anganwadi between 9am and 3.45pm. The court stated in its order that ""while the govt takes pride in running a programme like ICDS, it pays very little to workers, whereas there exists a master and servant relationship between the state of Gujarat and the AWWs and AWHs"".","Gujarat high court ruled that anganwadi workers (AWWs) are entitled to be absorbed as ""permanent employees holding civil posts"" in central or state govts.

NEW DELHI: Taking note of official figures that five trees are felled every hour in Delhi, Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea seeking a complete ban on cutting of any tree in the city without the court's permission, which at present is applicable to only forest trees.Underscoring that something needs to be done to check felling of trees, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih issued notices to Delhi govt and tree officers, asking them to respond by Nov 22. It said the court has to decide under what conditions and manner felling of trees should be allowed.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and lawyer Manan Verma, appearing for the petitioner, highlighted the grim picture of continuous felling of trees in recent years and said as authorities set up under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA) have failed to check it, Delhi's green cover is depleting.""There are procedural safeguards provided within the DPTA which are clearly visible in the flow of the Act wherein protection and preservation of trees precede the regulatory mechanism for felling of trees. These procedural safeguards have been grossly violated,"" the petition said.""It is clearly enshrined in Section 7 of the said Act that it shall be the responsibility of the Tree Authority to 'preserve all trees within its jurisdiction',"" the petition said.Referring to data compiled by the Delhi forest department, Sankaranarayanan told the bench that as per the latest figures, on an average, five trees are cut every hour. The total number of trees allowed to be felled under official sanction for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 under all categories was 1,33,117, which puts the annual felling of trees at 44,372.33 and over 5 trees per hour (2019-2021).The petition filed by Delhi-based environment activist Bhavreen Kandhari alleged that a comprehensive study of all the meetings of the Tree Authority revealed that the authority had met only eight times since its inception in 1995 till March 2021. ""The Tree Authority had an obligation to meet once every three months. Accordingly, it should have met at least a bare minimum of 104 times till July 2021, as per its statutory mandate,"" the petition said.Accusing the authority of not complying with SC's directions, the petition said, ""The law laid down by this court has great significance for Delhi, as the National Forest Policy mandates that one-third of the total land area of the country should be under forest or tree cover.""""However, it is pertinent to note that till date, Delhi has not met the standards prescribed under the said policy. As per the India State of Forest Report 2021 , the forest cover in Delhi is 13.1% and tree cover is 9.9%. Therefore, the total green cover is approximately 23% as opposed to 33% mandated by the said policy,"" it said.","Supreme Court agrees to hear a plea seeking a complete ban on cutting of any tree in the city without court's permission. At present, the ban is applicable to only forest trees. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih issued notices to Delhi govt and tree officers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115098482,imgsize-1683913,width-400,resizemode-4/115098482.jpg"

It has been mandated to submit its recommendation ""within one week"", with the state govt rendering a decision ""within the following fortnight"".The state's decision must subsequently be forwarded to the Centre for concurrence within three days, SC stated. The next date of hearing has been fixed on March 28.Notably, the backdrop of the directive encompasses a legal clarification by SC regarding the appropriate authority to handle remission pleas.

Her refusal to terminate pregnancy became the catalyst for their plot to eliminate her, a CBI probe had stated. Tripathi secured his own release in 2023 from judicial custody under govt's remission policy for those serving life terms.","Supreme Court issued a directive to the Uttarakhand govt to expedite the consideration of the remission plea by convict Rohit Chaturvedi.

""Inquiry cannot be based on speculations and assumptions. You are attempting to initiate a roving inquiry,"" the bench told Bhushan. ""If your petition is accepted, no one in this courtroom will be safe as a roving inquiry can be started against each and any person.""The trial court was completely silent as to what prima facie evidence it had to order initiation of proceedings.On Dec 3 last year, Justice M Nagaprasanna had dismissed the 'extortion complaint' against Kateel, saying the complainant was unrelated to the transaction and has no locus standi to maintain the extortion complaint.",Supreme Court dismisses plea for initiation of criminal investigations against former Karnataka BJP state unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel.

SC to decide validity of new law on CEC & ECs appointment on February 12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-decide-validity-of-new-law-on-cec-ecs-appointment-on-february-12/articleshow/117900416.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain a plea for interim stay on the selection of the next chief election commissioner after Rajiv Kumar retires on Feb 18, saying it would rather test the validity of the CEC and other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Officer and Terms of Office) Act, 2023, and give a finding.For one of the petitioners, advocate Prashant Bhushan requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh to stay the process for the selection of a new CEC on the grounds that the 2023 law breached the SC judgment, which had included the CJI in the selection committee along with the PM and the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, intending to make the panel independent of the executive.Bhushan said that by substituting the CJI with a Union cabinet minister in the three-member selection committee, the independence of the process has been breached. The absence of independence of the Election Commission, the CEC and the election commissioners (ECs) would pose grave danger to holding free and fair elections , which are vital to democracy.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said similar arguments were raised by the same counsel before a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, which by a well-reasoned interim order had last year refused to stay the operation of the 2023 law providing the mechanism for selection of the CEC and the ECs.He said SC had provided the composition of the selection panel but had categorically said that the interim arrangement would be operational till Parliament enacted a law, which it did in Dec 2023.The bench said instead of hearing the merits of pleas seeking interim stay on the operation of the 2023 law, it is better to hear the matter fully and decide it. It posted it for further hearing on Feb 12.By Feb 2024, Election Commission was reduced to a one-man commission with CEC Rajiv Kumar.

South Africa Land Confiscation: Trump Cuts Funding Over Human Rights Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/south-africa-is-confiscating-land-treating-people-very-badly-donald-trump-announces-halt-on-us-funding/articleshow/117871498.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

'Tax assessee’s word is final for us... trust is what we want': FM Nirmala Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tax-assessees-word-is-final-for-us-trust-is-what-we-want-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/117871124.cms,"A day after offering the largest tax relief ever in absolute terms, FM

explained the macroeconomic context of her

to TOI's Diwakar & Surojit Gupta. In an exclusive interview, she rejected the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base, while asserting that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties

Through income-tax relief, you appear to betting on rise in consumption. Was that the only consideration?

And spurring consumption could be a byproduct?

The salaried middle classes keep complaining that while they honestly pay taxes, they do not get bang for their buck because they do not get to use public schools or hospitals, there is no unemployment benefit or pension. How do you view this criticism?

How do you see the prospect of growth in the immediate term, given the global uncertainties?

How do you plan to provide relief to those who are outside the ambit of this tax relief. For example, in rural and urban centres?

Commentators have expressed concern over capex allocation.

There has been worry about the private sector not investing. What is holding them back?

The Economic Survey also spoke about wage growth not keeping pace with rise in corporate profits. How much does that have to do with weak demand?

They are also not passing on their profits to their employees and that has created this wage stagnation.

Privatisation of state-run companies has slowed down. Do you see the process taking off?

What other initiatives does the govt have in mind for creating jobs?

But there is criticism that quality employment is not being created.

India needs industrial growth as well as agricultural growth, but rural India is witnessing migration and now, we increasingly have only the elderly in villages.

There are worries about inflation.

What about fuel rates?

Is there any possibility of bringing fuel under GST?

Will GST rates be rationalised, particularly of essential commodities?

Will the Centre nudge states towards that end?

Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time... (On customs duty) We have been engaged in rationalisation for the past 2 years. We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new(Trump) regime coming in and our rationalisation Sitharaman

You were already having to deal with a lot of uncertainties. Now, you have a new factor in the unpredictable US President, Donald Trump. It has been said that the Budget did not factor in the Trump presidency.

What is going to be the mandate for the committee on deregulation that you have talked about?

You have pursued a new IT law since July. Will the changes be limited to simplification of language or go beyond?

In your speech, you hinted at a culture shift, saying the authorities have to first trust the assessee and then only scrutinise. Right now, the presumption, at least in practice, seems to be that you are guilty unless proven innocent. Will the bill shift the onus?

You have reduced customs duty on premium bikes. Is it a signal to the new US administration?

When do you plan to introduce the insurance bill?

You have followed the path of fiscal consolidation. Do we have the firepower in case the global situation turns adverse?

There is concern about the shrinking tax base which has further shrunk after the latest concessions. How do you see that? It is said the narrow tax base will lead to a longterm problem.

The finance ministry had very strong views on Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). You have now signalled a revamp. What is the intent behind this?

An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up Sitharaman

The focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov. So, was it the only consideration?

The govt has been fiscally prudent. When you spoke to the PM on the tax relief issue, what was his response

You have announced an asset monetisation plan. How will that proceed?

Will it cover the pending ones like

Hotel Ashok

, Stadia?

What about the choice of a sari with Madhubani art on Budget day?

The main consideration was that we should honour taxpayers, honest taxpayers who have been contributing to nation building.It can be. It can boost savings too.I also wish public services moved commensurately, but they are not just in the central govt’s hands. They are also in the local bodies’ hands, and in the state govt’s hands. There are elected representatives in all these places. They are all not run by the central govt. But I do sincerely wish that they improved for the sake of people.The World Bank and the IMF have clearly indicated that India will continue to be the fastest growing economy and despite all the odds and challenges resulting from extraneous reasons, we still have a very buoyant, strong economy. Our macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong. So, our growth will continue.We have several schemes to provide them relief such as Kisan Credit Card, whose limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Another Rs 50 crore will be brought in the ambit of the revamped Stand-Up India loans. Banks are giving record number of loans at discounted rates for affordable housing, while start-ups are getting another Rs 10,000 crore through the Fund of Funds. More than 2 lakh start-ups had registered for the hand-holding assistance in 2016. So, each sector has got affordable credit. At the grassroots, SHGs are getting a corpus for doing business.We will continue with our public sector expenditure. Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time.It is a commercial decision, which industries have to take as to when they want to get into the market to expand their capacity or build new capacities. So, beyond this, I may not be in a position to answer.Is true that after corporate tax rate was brought down in 2019, a lot of cleaning up of the books has happened. The twin balance sheet problem between companies and banks has been addressed. So, the companies are, I'm told, making profits but probably keeping it as passive investments, earning interest on the money but yet not feeling that at this time, it is adequate or proper for them to invest and expand capacities. So, they may take a call depending on how demand and export possibilities arise. It's also true that globally, exports are facing challenges and they want the pace of growth of exports to pick up a lot more, even that would be part of their considerations for taking the call.That's the point which the chief economic advisor has made.Privatisation will happen at least for those for which have been cleared by the cabinet. It’s quite a long list. We'll have to keep those units running profitably, professionally, to ensure they are vibrant units. We cannot neglect them just because they were put on the disinvestment list. We have been taking steps and that’s why many of the companies have now got good valuations; whether they are listed or not, at least they are being run professionally. Just as disinvestment is my responsibility, I am also responsible for keeping them in robust health. That’s what we are doing.The July Budget came up with five different schemes, four of which looked at employment generation in MSMEs and also in large corporations for which the govt scheme would come and support in terms of EPFO registration and so on. Of the five schemes, one was aimed at giving internship opportunities in top 500 companies. The pilot run of Phase 1 is over, the second pilot has begun; and so, the internship scheme is moving and students and young adults from very distant areas are benefitting without having to move out of their district. They are being placed with companies in their own districts. There are some who, by choice, want to go to Bengaluru or to Haryana, to Gurgaon or any other place. And have located them as well. They are all going through their internship. Besides that, Rozgar Melas are filling up all the vacant positions in the govt. In this Budget, which I've given for the leather industry, toy sector, for textiles, for critical minerals, for lithium ion batteries, I have already made enough number of announcements which are all labour intensive.Companies are in search of skilled workers. They tell me I want these many people with such skill sets. Job positions are available. The issue also is how many youth are available with required skill sets? Expectations are not being fulfilled because of this mismatch. Companies are not able to get such workers and those who have the skill sets are not able to reach the companies. We are trying to find a way to provide some exposure. We are working on this. Actually, this internship scheme is also about telling people what kind of jobs are available.Agricultural growth has been steady all over the country. Even during Covid, agriculture contributed significantly to India's GDP. In this Budget, we have provided two schemes for promoting rural livelihood and prosperity. The PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana has so many components that it should ensure that migration becomes an option rather than a compulsion. If you are getting an opportunity, there is no need for them to go out. If we create lots of opportunities, as the PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana intends to do, in rural districts with low productivity, by using high yielding and hybrid seeds, then they will find jobs there itself. They can be helped also by better handholding for marketing, and by value addition for those products.Inflation is not going up, it’s coming down. The data is released every month. Inflation is something which both the Reserve Bank of India and the Govt of India continuously monitor and try to bring down. Prices of products go up because of input costs and it is something which affects the entire buyer and seller market. But govt takes supply side measures to ensure adequate availability of goods, even perishable ones.State govts play a role. The data on inflation in states clearly shows those states which have not cut fuel prices are the ones who are suffering from higher inflation.GST Council turned down the suggestion. We suggested that at least aviation turbine fuel can be brought under GST and petrol and diesel remain outside, but state finance ministers did not agree. So, the question should be put to the state finance ministers, not to me.There is a discussion going on in the GST Council. We will let you know once they take the call.Centre is part of the GST Council and our inputs go into the eventual decision... meaning we'll discuss. The Centre's viewpoint will also go into it.You answered the question yourself. We will not get to know what the US administration or, for that matter, any other administration in the world is going to do about India unless they take a call. So, what exactly should I prepare for? We can only be mindful of and watchful about it. But what action can I take when there is no announcement about anything concerning India?Well, the details will be worked out, but they include items like, when licences have to be given or inspections are to be conducted or a certificate has to be issued for a product of a certain standard. Currently, there is lack of clarity. The industry or the manufacturers are asked one thing at one point in time, and quite another at some other point. The overall sense is that there is not a common approach; no SOP even if there is one. Manufacturers too have concerns about regulators. So, should there be a way to approach a problem from a manufacturer's point of view, from a trader’s point of view. So that we can go beyond merely saying ‘oh no, here is my rule and you have to follow’. Else, you are not going to get the licence. Another fellow says that I have to inspect you. And there is yet another who says I have to visit you each month. Such things are completely avoidable. So we want to bring some coherence in the way this is handled.It will be a comprehensive approach to making the Income Tax Act relevant to the 21st century; relevant to an era which is technology-driven; relevant to times where the taxpayer is most often doing the assessment and filing himself. So, for a citizen to be able to deal with income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. It is also something we are working on because of the looseness and ambiguity of language. There are also several issues in courts where both sides appear to be right. That is because of the language used in the Act. And why should it be like that? The Act came in 1965 and India has since seen major changes; in 1991, the economy opened up, liberalization came in. Then, in 2020, Covid struck. So many changes have happened, and there have only been additions to the Act in response. Are they all consistent? Are the additions aligned with the original intent of the law? All of this has necessitated a comprehensive relook.Even now, when it comes to the question of this Budget proposal on the people who have more than one residence or one house, we have said that selfdeclaration, whether one is being used for personal purpose or whether one has been rented out is fine with us. It is for the tax assessee to say what he wants to say, and for us his word is final. That is already on.Trust is what we want and, therefore, trust is what we are trying to use as a first step. Self-declaration, yes, trust is the first thing.We have been engaged in rationalisation of customs duty for the past two years We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new regime coming in and our work on rationalisation.We will let you know once we have something on this. At the moment, I have said that we will be bringing the income tax bill this week.Our fundamentals are strong even now. So my fiscal deficit is continuously assessed. The deficit number is given in the glide path and that is what I am following. Not one single year have I failed. And that would not be possible if my fundamentals were not strong.So, is it wiser to keep loading the narrow base with taxes because that is the only set of people I have for paying taxes? Even that's not right. Therefore, we have said that we need to give relief. We will give relief because that's honouring the taxpayer and he has been contributing all the while. But it is also equally upon us to widen the tax base and keep newer people coming in who have not been earlier paying taxes, who are probably in the tax payable net. So, we will draw them in.We want to have the draft BIT to be a bit more investor friendly. That’s why I want to do it.In the July Budget too, we announced schemes for Bihar when elections were not on the horizon. An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. That is why we revived fertiliser plants in the region. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up. Bihar is part of the Buddhist tourism circuit but lacks a big international airport. Is giving it one greenfield airport an excess? I am surprised by the criticism. I don't think we need an opposition which is opposed to the progress of such a state. They should say openly that they are against Bihar's development. Don't do anything for Bihar because we don't want you to develop Bihar, is this what they are trying to say? The PM has repeatedly said that a state needs to improve irrespective of the party in office. Else, it will become a drag and pull you down. So, I'm happy we are doing this.Right from the beginning, his guidance was to find out how you would be able do it , what is going to be the formulation and, so, we worked with the department of revenue, CBDT and only then went with the proposal. Various different.The first plan went well and we are bringing the second edition and under that we will plough back about Rs 10 lakh crore under that and I have mentioned this in the budget speech. We will take it forward.I wouldn't name individual items but yes it will cover a whole lot of sectors.This is a very interesting story. I had gone to Madhubani in Nov when I was introduced to Dulari Devi, who is known for her paintings. She belongs to the fishing community, an EBC, and she gave this sari to me and told me to wear it on Budget day. I offered to pay but she would not let me. She said it is our custom to give sari and other gifts when a daughter visits home. On Budget day, I remembered her and so....",FM Sitharaman explains the macroeconomic context of her Budget. She rejects the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base. She asserts that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties. She says the focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117874938,imgsize-696280,width-400,resizemode-4/117874938.jpg"

Prime Minister is the biggest OBC face in the country. Can he not see that? PM of the country is an OBC. He is the most popular leader in the world. Can he not see that? Is Rahul Gandhi blind?"" Rijiju said.""I am an ST. I am working as the Parliamentary Affairs Minister of the country. MoS Arjun Ram Meghwal is working as the Law Minister, he is an SC. Can't he see that? Did Congress party ever make a Tribal or Dalit the Law Minister of the country? Did Congress make an OBC the Prime Minister? I think Rahul Gandhi doesn't know what he says,"" he added.Rijiju's reaction came after Rahul reiterated the demand for a caste census, arguing that OBCs, Dalits, and tribals remain underrepresented in economic and political power structures.""We conducted a caste survey in Telangana and found that 90 per cent of the population comprises Dalits, tribals, backward classes, and minorities. Yet, none of the largest corporates in this country are owned by them,"" he said.Addressing BJP's OBC leaders, he said, ""Remember, OBCs make up 50 per cent of the population, but you have no real power. I know you cannot even open your mouth. That is the truth of this country.""Rijiju also attacked Rahul for claiming that the foreign minister S Jaishankar traveled to the United States to secure an invitation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend Donald Trump's inauguration.Taking to X, Rijiju suggested that the Rahul is expected to be matured and he should speak in the Parliament with full responsibility.""Shri Rahul Gandhi is expected to be matured and he should speak in the Parliament with full responsibility as a member as well as the Leader of Opposition. I strongly condemn his attempts to malign India's image,"" Rijiju said.""We have raised objection to what LoP Rahul Gandhi has said. He is the LoP; how can he claim that the External Affairs Minister went to the US to get the PM invited for President (Trump's) inauguration? Besides, how can he claim that the Army chief has rejected the PM's statement? The PM and the system are one, and the PM is the head of the government. Does Rahul Gandhi have no idea that the PM is responsible for the functioning of the country?"" he added.Earlier, Gandhi cited statements from the chief of Army staff to assert that Chinese troops have entered Indian territory.""Our Chief of Army Staff has said that the Chinese are inside our territory. This is a fact. The reason China is inside our territory is important...The reason China is sitting inside this country is because 'Make in India' has failed,"" LoP said.""The reason China sitting inside this country is because India is refusing to produce and I'm worried that India is going to give up this revolution to the Chinese once again...If and when we fight a war with China, we will be fighting with Chinese electric motors, Chinese batteries and Chinese optics and we will be buying Chinese motors, Chinese optics and Chinese batteries,"" he added.Rahul also claimed that if India had a better production system and were looking to develop technologies like AI, the US president would come and invite the Prime Minister.""Our foreign policy would take into account this revolution. When we talk to the United States, we would not send our foreign minister to invite our Prime Minister to his coronation,"" Gandhi said.""Because if we had a production system and if we were working on these technologies, the American President would come here and invite the Prime Minister,"" he added.",Kiren Rijiju asked Rahul why Congress did not make a Tribal or a Dalit the law minister or an OBC a Prime Minister.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday took a dig at leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi for mentioning 'China' 34 times in his 45 minute speech during the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President’s address.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a video in a social media post on X, compiling the bits where Rahul mentioned China during his address.""Rahul Gandhi mentioned China 34 times in his 45 minute speech,"" Malviya said.BJP MP Sambit Patra also attacked Rahul Gandhi, claiming that the previous UPA governments were responsible for India's manufacturing sector lagging behind China.""I feel like addressing him as 'Rahul Jinping'. He took China's name 34 times. He must be praying that he gets to be Chinese in his next life. Rahul Gandhi said that manufacturing in China is high and India is lagging. From 2004-14, the trade deficit between India and China was 25 times high,"" Patra said.""He said that only 1-2 companies are given importance in the banking sector and poor people are being neglected. PM Modi gave loans to 51 crore people under MUDRA scheme. Congress was against the UPI system. Today, 500 million transactions are taking place through UPI,"" he added.BJP's reaction came hours after the Congress leader said that China has at least a 10-year lead on India in the production sector of the economy.""People talk about AI, but it's important to understand that AI on its own is absolutely meaningless because AI operates on top of data. Without data, AI means nothing. And if we look at data today, there is one thing which is very clear. Every single piece of data that comes out of the production system in the world. The data that was used to make this phone, the data that is used to make electric cars,"" Rahul said.""The data that is used to make basically all electronics on the planet today is owned by China. And the consumption data is owned by the United States. China has at least a 10-year lead on India in this space. China has been working on batteries, robots, motors, optics for the last 10 years and we are behind. We would ensure that our banking system is not captured by 2-3 companies that basically do not allow you to build a production system. But our banking system is open, dynamic, and accessible to small and medium businesses and to millions and millions of entrepreneurs who want to take part in this revolution,"" he added.Congress MP also criticised the government's ‘Make in India’ initiative and claimed its failure has allowed China to establish a presence within Indian territory.Gandhi cited statements from the chief of Army staff to assert that Chinese troops have entered Indian territory.""Our Chief of Army Staff has said that the Chinese are inside our territory.

It was unusually rainy, hot and humid that night in Bacolod City, Philippines. The Bureau of Immigration assembled a crack team of select agents from their Fugitive Search Unit (FSU) to hunt down a high-value suspect. The target was an ""Indian-Nepalese"" national, the subject of a red-corner notice, located by Indian agencies in their country.The subject, Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group and a wanted criminal in India. He was tipped to be hiding in an apartment in Barangay Tackling locality in Bacolod. The police in Delhi and central agencies identified the alias ""Kanta Gupta"" that Geong was using to stay undercover.Acting on real-time information from their Indian counterparts, the FSU sleuths carried out a clean operation, apprehending their suspect in an ""in-and-out"" sweep.However, this was just the beginning of a tedious process of getting a fugitive back. Delhi Police 's Special Cell, CBI, Intelligence Bureau and Haryana Police followed Geong closely for months. As deportation proceedings began, Geong was detained at BI warden facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, in high security. There was a chance that Khalistan groups could try to free him.It took almost six months for the Indian authorities to get hold of Geong as he was flown in from Manila to Bangkok two days ago and, finally, to India, where he was arrested by Delhi Police's Special Cell early on Sunday.The events started to unfold early in 2024 when Indian agency sleuths shared information with their counterparts in Manila, said a source. The immigration subsequently issued a 'mission order' for Geong's arrest. Geong was heading an organised crime syndicate and was sentenced to life imprisonment in India. After cops got hot on his trail, Geong fled to the Philippines, where he assumed a fake identity and re-established his gang. Interestingly, he fled to South Africa in mid-2000 and was deported in 2007 too.""He is the younger brother of Surender Geong, who died in an exchange of fire with Haryana Police in 2018. Geong spread his tentacles in Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Gurgaon and Delhi and was attempting to re-establish a network for extorting money from doctors, contractors, liquor vendors and other financially well-off businessmen,"" said a senior cop.After settling down in the Philippines, he reorganised his gang and started his criminal enterprise and further got fully involved in the terror network of Arsh Dalla, a designated and wanted terrorist of KTF.The Davinder Bambhia gang, currently operated by wanted fugitive Lucky Patial, also came on board, having a fraternal relationship with Kaushal Chaudhary's gang. Soon, Geong rose to be a key planner and organiser of manpower, harbouring fugitives and moving narcotics and weapons as a logistical hub to facilitate the activities of these criminal networks.This network then carried out sensational killings of Youth Akal Dal leader Vicky Midhukhera, Gurlal Brar and Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in recent years. According to police, Geong's criminal history spans 24 cases, with convictions in 15 cases, including five murder cases. A reward of Rs 1.5 lakh was declared on him.Geong's arrest is expected to reveal new information about the terror-criminal nexus, their international connections, and potential links with hostile foreign entities.""The arrest marks a major milestone in the collaboration between Delhi and Haryana Police forces to combat the terrorist-gangster nexus with help from central agencies,"" said Additional Commissioner (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha.

'Shows Weak...': Rahul Gandhi Roasts PM Modi Over 'Trump Invite'; Jaishankar Rebuts | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha witnessed high political drama as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack on the ruling BJP, taking jabs at its narratives, budget, and foreign policy.From questioning the government's reluctance to acknowledge Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy to mocking the absence of photos from the Halwa ceremony and alleging that India sought an invitation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Donald Trump’s inauguration, Gandhi’s remarks triggered sharp rebuttals from the treasury benches, setting off a heated debate in Parliament.In a fiery speech in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi took direct aim at the ruling BJP, accusing it of selectively invoking historical figures while sidelining India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.""You talk about Sardar Patel ji, but you destroy his values every day. You talk about Ambedkar ji, but you destroy his values every day. You talk about Nehruji... No, you don’t talk about Nehru ji,"" Gandhi said, correcting himself mid-sentence and emphasizing his point.His remark, made in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscored a long-standing critique that the BJP often neglects Nehru’s contributions while in India's historical discourse. Congress leaders have frequently accused the ruling party of distorting history.Gandhi also took a dig at the Centre over the conspicuous absence of photographs from the customary Halwa ceremony preceding this year’s Union Budget. The Congress leader had previously raised concerns about representation at the event, claiming last year that he ""didn’t see one OBC, tribal, or Dalit officer"" present.""Before this year’s budget, there was no photograph. I was appalled that they served the Halwa but didn’t show whom it was served to,"" Gandhi remarked sarcastically.""Halwa khilaya magar dikhaya nahi kisko khilaya (They distributed Halwa but didn’t show to whom it was served),"" he added, drawing laughter and jeers from respective sides of the House.Gandhi linked this to his push for a caste census, citing a recent survey conducted in Telangana that, according to him, revealed “shocking” disparities.“Almost 90% of Telangana’s population comprises Dalits, Adivasis, backwards, or minorities. I am convinced this is the case across the country. The OBC population of this country is not even one less than 55%,” he said, reinforcing Congress’ demand for nationwide caste-based data.Gandhi also launched a broadside against India’s diplomatic approach, alleging that the government was positioning India as a subordinate power rather than a global leader.“When we talk to the United States, we should not be sending our foreign minister to invite our Prime Minister to their coronation,” he said, in a pointed reference to Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s visit to the US ahead of Donald Trump’s first swearing-in ceremony in 2017.His comments sparked an uproar in the House, with Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju immediately countering the claim.“The Leader of Opposition cannot make such serious unsubstantial statements. This is related to the relationship between two countries, and he is making an unverified statement about the Prime Minister’s invitation,” Rijiju said.Speaker Om Birla intervened, asking Gandhi to either provide evidence or withdraw the claim. The Congress leader, however, chose to respond with a characteristic jibe.“I apologize for disturbing your peace of mind…” he said, drawing mixed reactions from the treasury benches and opposition ranks.Later in the day, external affairs minister S Jaishankar rejected the allegations, stating that the PM does not attend such events, and is instead represented by a special envoy.""Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi deliberately spoke a falsehood about my visit to the US in December 2024. I went to meet the Secretary of State and NSA of the Biden Administration. Also to chair a gathering of our Consuls General. During my stay, the incoming NSA-designate met with me,"" Jaishankar said in a post on X.Jaishankar further said that, ""Rahul Gandhi's lies may be intended politically. But they damage the nation abroad.""","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took direct aim at the ruling BJP, accusing it of selectively invoking historical figures while sidelining India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

"In migrant haven, Kerala women get hitched to 'guest workers'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-migrant-haven-kerala-women-get-hitched-to-guest-workers/articleshow/117866139.cms,"Rajendra Naik, from Odisha, with wife Rajani and children. An exodus of young, educated Malayali men seeking professional opportunities abroad seems to have played a role in local women choosing their life partners from among eligible bachelors from the east looking to settle in Kerala.

Love at the workplace is the new social glue for migrant workers from eastern India moving to Kerala in droves for higher wages and a welfare net that includes insurance and accommodation. The trend is reflected in many Malayali women marrying ""guest workers"" in India's homegrown Gulf, which is projected to have a migrant population of around 50 lakh by 2030.An exodus of young, educated Malayali men seeking professional opportunities abroad seems to have created not just a productivity gap in the state but also played a role in local women choosing their life partners from among eligible bachelors from the east looking to settle in Kerala.Rajendra Naik, a native of Odisha employed as a machine operator in a plywood factory in Perumbavoor, married Rajani from Kollam some years ago after a distant relative of the bride's family suggested the match.""It was an arranged marriage, and we met at her house,"" says Rajendra. ""I am more of a Malayali now, although my surname is a giveaway. I love the local festivals, and my wife makes excellent fish curry. Life couldn't be better.""Rajendra and Rajani's children speak Malayalam and can understand Odiya, bridging whatever remains of the regional and cultural divide.The influx of migrants from Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odisha has been critical to sustaining productivity in Kerala for over a decade. Even an unskilled labourer can earn up to Rs 25,000 in monthly wages, far above the national average.Rajendra, who is also the vice president of the AITUC-affiliated National Migrant Workers' Union (NMWU), says eligible young men from the eastern region are preferred as grooms because they work hard, are willing to stay back in Kerala, adapt culturally, and don't expect dowry.Learning Malayalam poses a problem, but many workers pick up the language after spending years in the state. LDF govt's encouragement of migrants, officially referred to as guest workers, through various schemes makes settling in Kerala an easy choice to make for most.Most cross-cultural weddings occur in the hinterland and the hilly parts of Kerala, where migrant workers are employed as carpenters, masons, rubber tappers and farmhands. ""The urge to have a life partner increases when you work in remote areas. Cultural identities don't matter,"" says Aman Naik, a foreman in a timber mill. Aman fell in love with Raji, a resident of Wayanad, and approached her family with a marriage proposal. They accepted him without hesitation.Sabeenath, from Kattapanna in Idukki, was a single mother when she met Aliyar, a Bihar native. ""My first husband deserted me, but Aliyar was ready to accept me with my children,"" she says.The family bought a small house in Perumbavoor and settled there.Sandhya R S, professor and head of the sociology department at Kerala University, believes that learning Malayalam is the key to assimilation for migrant workers.""What makes this trend interesting is that many of these migrants don't stay in their old jobs long. Some start businesses or secure better jobs over time, which helps them gain stability and respect,"" she says.A demographic study on migrant workers released by Central University of Punjab in 2021 pegged the number of migrant workers in Kerala till 2017-18 at 31 lakh.Currently, one out of every four workers in Kerala are from other states. The ratio is even more skewed in urban areas like Ernakulam, where one out of every two workers are migrants.Binu Bos, general secretary of NMWU, says social acceptance of migrant workers in Kerala results from consistent efforts by various organisations, including his union.""There was a time when these workers were subjected to exploitation. Their daily wage in 2002 was Rs 250, while native workers used to get Rs 700. The union created awareness about wages. We encouraged them to invest their money in Kerala and educate their children in the schools here,"" he says.Benoy Peter, executive director of Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, points out that Kerala now offers the best working conditions for migrant workers.","Love at the workplace is the new social glue for migrant workers from eastern India. Trend is reflected in many Malayali women marrying ""guest workers"" in India's homegrown Gulf. The influx of migrants from Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odisha has been critical to sustaining productivity in Kerala for over a decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117866662,imgsize-76444,width-400,resizemode-4/117866662.jpg"
IndiGo Passenger has nightmare experience over pre-booked meal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/never-flying-indigo-again-delhi-doctor-has-nightmare-experience-over-pre-booked-meal/articleshow/117881623.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi-based doctor Suvrankar Datta slammed IndiGo Airlines after enduring what he called a ""nightmare"" experience on a recent Bangalore-Delhi flight. Datta, a radiologist at AIIMS, took to social media to highlight concerns over passenger safety and service standards.In a series of posts on X, Dr Datta detailed his ordeal, saying that his pre-booked meal was not served on time despite multiple follow-ups with the cabin crew. As someone with borderline high blood sugar levels, pointed out the importance of timely meals to avoid medical complications.""Never flying Indigo again! My recent flight from Bangalore to Delhi turned into a nightmare that I hope no one else has to experience! "" Datta said in a post.“I always pre-book my meals because I have borderline high sugar levels, prefer having my meals on time and avoid overeating or skipping meals… So, pre-booked a sandwich on this afternoon flight as from experience they always ignore non pre-booked meals!” he wrote.According to his account, the flight took off around 3:30 pm, and meal service began shortly after. When the crew reached his seat, they informed him that his pre-booked meal might be delayed due to an issue at Bangalore airport. Initially patient, Dr Datta waited, but after half an hour, he grew concerned and requested an update. He alleged that the crew repeatedly ignored him despite his persistent inquiries.“I still waited, growing increasingly irritated and jittery from hypoglycemia. Around 4:00 pm, a kind passenger noticed my distress and offered me her sandwich,” he wrote, adding that he then pressed the emergency call light but received no response.Frustration escalated when the captain announced the descent while his meal issue remained unresolved. “What if this neglect put someone in a medical emergency in real danger?” he questioned.Dr Datta said he finally received his meal at 5:40 pm, but by then, he was severely hypoglycemic. To add to his frustration, the crew served him black coffee instead of black tea, despite his specific request. “By that time, I was so hypoglycaemic that I did not even have the energy or strength to argue!” he said.His biggest concern, he claimed, was the airline's failure to respond to his emergency call button for nearly 30 minutes. He also accused the crew of showing “appalling unprofessionalism and arrogance,” stating that they neither apologized nor offered an explanation for the delay.Responding to the allegations, Indigo said in a post, ""Dr Datta, thank you for taking the time to speak with us and allowing us to address the matter. We sincerely apologise for the delay in serving your pre-booked meal and the inconvenience this caused.""""At IndiGo, we are committed to understanding and prioritising our customers' needs and comfort. Please be assured that we take your feedback seriously and have taken the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence,"" the airlines added."," Delhi-based doctor Suvrankar Datta slammed IndiGo Airlines after enduring what he called a ""nightmare"" experience on a recent Bangalore-Delhi flight.

'Make in India was a good idea, but it failed'

'We handed over production to China'

‘China is inside our territory; Army Chief has said it’

'China is sitting on 4000 sq km of our territory'

'AI is meaningless without data; China leads by 10 years'

'India’s banking system must be open and dynamic'

'Social tensions are rising in India'

'Same speech every time'

'No clear answer on unemployment'

'Foreign policy should prioritize India’s technological growth'

‘BJP was forced to bow before the Constitution’

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi criticized the Narendra Modi government during the Lok Sabha debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address, stating that the 'Make in India' initiative had failed and that India's manufacturing sector has suffered under the current government.“The Prime Minister proposed the 'Make in India' program, I think it was a good idea... The result is right in front of you, manufacturing fell from 15.3% of GDP in 2014 to 12.6% of GDP today, which is the lowest share of manufacturing in 60 years,” Rahul Gandhi said.He added, “I am not blaming the Prime Minister, it would not be fair to say that he did not try. I could say that the Prime Minister tried, but he failed.”Rahul Gandhi criticized India's inability to build a strong manufacturing base, saying, ""Any country basically organizes two things: consumption and production. The modern way of saying organizing consumption is services, and the modern way of saying organizing production is manufacturing. But there is more to production than just manufacturing. We have, as a country, failed in organizing production.""He added, ""We have excellent companies that try to organize production, but essentially, what we have done is we have handed over the organization of production to the Chinese. This mobile phone, even though we say we make this mobile phone in India, that is not a fact. This phone is not made in India. This phone is assembled in India. All the components of this phone are made in China... we are paying a tax to China.""On national security, Gandhi alleged that China had occupied Indian territory, saying, ""Our Chief of Army Staff has said that the Chinese are inside our territory. This is a fact.""He linked China's aggression to economic failures, asserting, ""The reason China is sitting inside this country is because 'Make in India' has failed. The reason China is sitting inside this country is because India is refusing to produce, and I'm worried that India is going to give up this revolution to the Chinese once again.""He warned that India’s defense sector was overly reliant on Chinese imports. ""If and when we fight a war with China, we will be fighting with Chinese electric motors, Chinese batteries, and Chinese optics, and we will be buying Chinese motors, Chinese optics, and Chinese batteries.""Gandhi made a strong statement regarding India's territorial disputes, asserting, “The Prime Minister has denied it and the Army has contradicted the Prime Minister that China is sitting on 4000 sq km of our territory...”In response, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanded evidence for the claim, stating, “You will have to present the evidence of what you are speaking in the House.”Discussing artificial intelligence, Gandhi remarked, “People talk about AI, but it's important to understand that AI on its own is absolutely meaningless because AI operates on top of data. Without data, AI means nothing.”He pointed out that China owns most of the world's production data while the United States dominates consumption data. “China has at least a 10-year lead on India in this space. China has been working on batteries, robots, motors, and optics for the last 10 years, and we are behind,” he said.Gandhi criticized the concentration of economic power, stating, “We would ensure that our banking system is not captured by 2-3 companies that basically do not allow you to build a production system.”He advocated for an open and dynamic banking system that supports small and medium businesses, enabling millions of entrepreneurs to take part in India’s economic growth.The Congress leader also warned of increasing social unrest in the country, linking it to economic distress. “India has to focus completely on production; social tension is on the rise in India,” he said.Taking a dig at the President’s address, he remarked, “I must say, I struggled through the President's address to maintain my attention on what was being said because I had heard pretty much the same President’s address the last time and the time before that. It was the same laundry list of the things that the government has done.”On the issue of employment, Gandhi admitted that neither the Congress-led UPA nor the current NDA government had given a “clear-cut answer to the youth of this country about employment.” He noted that while India has grown economically, unemployment remains a persistent challenge.Rahul Gandhi’s remarks come amid an ongoing political debate over job creation and economic policies, with opposition parties questioning the government’s claims on manufacturing and employment.Gandhi criticized India’s approach to global diplomacy, stating that India should leverage its economic and technological strength in foreign relations.“When we talk to the United States, we would not send our foreign minister to invite our Prime Minister to his coronation... If we had a production system and if we were working on these technologies, the American President would come here and invite the Prime Minister,” he remarked.Gandhi also took a dig at the BJP over its past claims of winning '400 paar' seats and amending the Constitution. ""I remember before the elections, all of you (BJP) were saying '400 Paar' and that you would change this (referring to the Constitution). And then I was glad to see that the Prime Minister walked in and was forced to bow his head in front of the Constitution.""He credited the Congress for ensuring that the Constitution remained intact, stating, ""It was a moment of pride for all Congress people that we had explained to the Prime Minister and to the whole country that no force will dare touch this. I know that the RSS has never accepted this. Mohan Bhagwat has said that India didn't get independence in 1947. He has said that this is meaningless. We will never let your dream come true. This Constitution is going to rule India always.""","Rahul Gandhi criticized the Narendra Modi government during the Lok Sabha debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address.

'Look At Me First...': Rahul Gandhi's Roaring Attack On PM Modi Over Budget In Parliament

NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha , Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a swipe at the Centre while questioning why the Centre did not release photos of the customary Halwa ceremony ahead of this year's Union Budget.The Congress leader took the dig in the backdrop of his remarks last year when he had claimed that he didn't see ""one OBC or tribal or Dalit officer during the Halwa ceremony "".""Before this year's budget there was no photograph, I was appalled that they served the Halwa but didn't show whom it was served to,"" Rahul Gandhi said in a jibe at the Centre.""Halwa khilaya magar dikhaya nahi kisko khilaya (they distributed halwa but didn't show to whom it was served),"" he said.Calling participation a key element for a new development paradigm, the Congress leader said: ""We have done a caste census in Telangana. What we have found is shocking. Almost 90 per cent of Telangana is either Dailt, Adivasis, backwards, or minorities. I am convinced that is the story across the country. I am absolutely convinced that the OBC population of this country is not even one less than 55 per cent.Last year, during the debate in Lok Sabha, the Rae Bareli MP triggered a massive political storm when he claimed that no official in the Halwa ceremony was Tribal or Dalit.""'Budget ka halwa' is being distributed in this photo.

'Unwilling to work hard even with Rs 1 crore salary': US-based CEO post on 'engineers for Indian office' creates stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unwilling-to-work-hard-even-with-rs-1-crore-salary-us-based-ceo-post-on-engineers-for-indian-office-creates-stir/articleshow/117872762.cms,"NEW DELHI: IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi , CEO of the US-based tech company Giga ML , ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry after he claimed in a post on X that many Indian engineers are unwilling to work hard despite being offered high salaries.“I’ve noticed a pattern in hiring engineers for our Indian office. Even with a base salary of Rs 1 crore, many are unwilling to work hard. A significant number of engineers with 3–8 years of experience are reluctant to work six days a week,” Vummadi wrote in a post.Vummadi expressed frustration over the attitude of engineers in India, particularly those in the early and mid-stages of their careers. He later doubled down on his stance, referencing his own family’s work ethic. He added, “My dad and mom are government teachers. They still work 6 days a week. 6*8 hrs for a Rs 1 crore base salary, which is significantly above benchmark for 3-8 year experienced people, is extremely fair.”He further added, “So work-life balance is what cuts it for attention and press in Indian crowd. People who are willing to work hard—hope they don't get eaten up by this virus. Many successful startups did 6 or 7 days a week. @elonmusk is a living example of where you can be if you work hard.”His comments triggered mixed reactions online. While some agreed with his observations, others pointed out that productivity does not necessarily correlate with longer working hours. Many argued that sustainable productivity and mental well-being should not be compromised for financial incentives.“Work ethic isn’t just about hours—it’s about impact. If talented engineers are hesitating despite a Rs1 crore base salary, it might be worth considering whether expectations align with modern work culture . Sustainable productivity often beats sheer hours,” one user commented.Another user pushed back against the notion of overworking for money, saying, “You can't buy cracked folks. They appreciate money, don’t worship it!”",IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry.

A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office, Reuters reported quoting an official on Monday.The official confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India but is not expected to arrive for at least 24 hours.The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights. So far, the military aircraft have transported migrants to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras.Military deportation flights come at a high cost, with a recent flight to Guatemala estimated to have cost at least $4,675 per migrant, according to a Reuters report.The Indian government has signaled its willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration in identifying and repatriating its citizens residing illegally in the US, aiming to maintain strong ties and avoid a trade conflict.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case, we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India,"" he added.According to sources familiar with the matter, both nations have identified approximately 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation, though the actual number could be significantly higher, as the total remains uncertain, Bloomberg had reported last month.India accounts for a relatively small share of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens making up about 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.In contrast, Latin American nations like Mexico, Venezuela, and Guatemala contribute a much larger portion. However, the number of Indian illegal migrants has been steadily increasing, particularly at the northern US border, where they now represent nearly a quarter of all illegal crossings—the highest among migrants stopped at that entry point.While the exact total remains uncertain, a 2022 department of homeland security report estimated that approximately 2,20,000 unauthorized Indian immigrants were residing in the US.","The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights.

"70% of Indians optimistic of education system, 30% globally: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-of-indians-optimistic-of-education-system-30-globally-report/articleshow/117899097.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has emerged as one of the most optimistic nations regarding education and socioeconomic mobility. The latest Educational Testing Service (ETS) Human Progress Report, released in India Tuesday, conducted across 18 countries, underscored that India's optimism about its education system stands in stark contrast to the global sentiment. However, challenges in accessibility and teacher availability persist.While only 30% of respondents worldwide expressed optimism about their country's current education status, 70% of Indians held a positive outlook. Similarly, confidence in future improvements is higher in India at 76% compared to the global average of 64%. Despite this optimism, a significant portion of the Indian population recognises systemic challenges - 84% of respondents believe accessing quality education remains difficult, and 78% acknowledge that educational opportunities are skewed toward certain privileged groups. Furthermore, 74% pointed to a shortage of teachers, highlighting a major bottleneck in India's educational progress.Compared to the global average, Indians more frequently cited the lack of high-quality educational programmes (34% vs 22%) and institutions (29% vs 20%) as barriers. India is one of the most favourable countries toward non-profit organisations, with 26% agreeing that non-profits can play a role in improving access to high-quality education, compared to 19% globally.India's confidence extends beyond education into the realm of socioeconomic mobility. Nearly 69% of Indians believe in their current opportunities for upward mobility, compared to a global average of 55%. Looking ahead to 2035, 72% expect improvements, compared to 62% in other countries.However, economic barriers persist. More Indians than their global counterparts cited job shortages (40% vs 34%), expensive education (33% vs 28%), and lack of advancement knowledge (29% vs 22%) as key hurdles. Notably, fewer Indians (19%) felt that a lack of connections hindered their opportunities, compared to the global average of 28%.Amit Sevak, CEO of ETS, said: ""India has made impressive strides in foundational learning, but disparities persist between urban and rural areas and across states. One of the biggest factors influencing student outcomes is teacher quality.""India's workforce is rapidly adapting to new skill requirements, with upskilling becoming a widely accepted necessity. About 91% of Indians believe lifelong learning will become a career standard, significantly higher than the global norm. Moreover, 88% anticipate that credentials and certifications will gain more importance than university degrees in the coming years, compared to 75% worldwide. The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market is a major concern, with 88% of Indians recognising its transformative impact on essential skills. Notably, Indians foresee AI as a complementary tool rather than a threat, with widespread belief that those who integrate AI into their work will replace those who do not.India's high optimism on education and career growth contrasts with more tempered global perspectives. While the country acknowledges significant challenges in accessibility and infrastructure, its population remains committed to skill development and career advancement.The findings also underscore the role of non-profits and govt partnerships in addressing existing gaps. With initiatives supporting skill assessments, teacher quality improvement, and AI integration in learning, India appears poised to navigate these challenges effectively.","India has emerged as one of the most optimistic nations regarding education and socioeconomic mobility.

The SG flagged what he described as the separatist ideological orientation of the petitioner.“This civil society organisation wants to keep the pot boiling and does not want peace to return to the state,” he said. The bench said it would keep aside the issue of as to which court, Supreme Court or high court, should hear the matter. It posted further hearing on March 24.Appearing for the Kuki group, advocate Prashant Bhushan alleged that a person during the meeting with Biren Singh had secretly recorded the chief minister who was purportedly boasting about allowing Meitei militants to loot the armoury and how he protected them.“The transcript of the audio clips are very serious,” he said. He demanded that matter be sent to Truth Lab, claiming that the forensic laboratory is far more efficient than any govt-run CFSL.On Nov 8 last year, SC had asked Bhushan to “file before this court all material indicating the authenticity of the clip”. It also kept open for consideration the availability of alternative remedies to the petitioner for resorting to Article 226 and raising the issue before the high court.Violence had erupted in Kuki-dominated tribal areas in May 2023 after Manipur HC asked the state govt to respond to a 10-year-old communication from Centre on the demand of Meiteis to be granted ST status like the Kukis, who feared that the development posed a risk to their hold over “reserved” jobs.","A Supreme Court bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to produce the report, on audio clips purportedly of Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh, in six weeks.

""The research began in Oct 2024. This is a pilot study, and it will take another nine months to complete the research,"" the official said. Members of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers' Association (JNUTA) have expressed concern about the timing of the report, drawing parallels to the release of a similar study before the Maharashtra elections.""The report is astonishing. It is strange to see a sudden interest in a particular community before elections. The timing is questionable. This is reminiscent of the release of a similar Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) report just before the Maharashtra elections. The way narratives are built in this manner is problematic. Repeating govt rhetoric doesn't benefit academic research,"" said Moushumi Basu, JNUTA president. Basu also raised questions about the report's presentation, pointing out that the first page states, 'JNU presents report'.""The second important question to ask is whether all projects done by the JNU faculty are accorded similar treatment,"" said Basu.The research team, listed on the report, includes two investigators from the Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies, with other team members' names withheld for security reasons. The findings further state, ""Illegal immigration to Delhi has significantly altered the city's demographic landscape, with a large influx of migrants from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar."" According to the report, these migrants often settle in overcrowded neighbourhoods, such as Seelampur, Jamia Nagar, Zakir Nagar, Sultanpuri, Mustafabad, Jaffrabad, Dwarka, Govindpuri, among others, ""where they strain resources and disrupt local social cohesion"".Apart from the burden on infrastructure, healthcare, and education, the report talks about the ""resentment among Delhi's native population"". ""Migrants' participation in low-wage jobs has created economic competition with local workers, leading to resentment among Delhi's native population.

Because if we had a production system and we were working on these technologies, the US president would come here and invite the PM,"" Rahul said.Accusing Rahul of lying, Jaishankar said he went to meet the secretary of state and the US NSA, and to chair a gathering of consuls general. ""During my stay, incoming NSA-designate met with me. At no stage was an invitation in respect of PM discussed... Our PM does not attend such events. In fact, India is generally represented by special envoys. Rahul's lies may be intended politically, but they damage the nation abroad,"" he said.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan joined in and dubbed Rahul's statement as ""frivolous and objectionable"". ""At least this has never happened in democratic parliamentary tradition of this country. In matters of foreign policy , the governing party and opposition always stood together. But due to his conduct and working style, Rahul Gandhi is constantly seen standing against the country,"" he said.With the PM in attendance, Rahul said Modi's ' Make in India ' has failed as manufacturing to GDP share has dropped to a 60-year low from 15.3% to 12.6%. In contrast, he said China controls production of critical technology that drive change in mobility - electric motors, batteries, optics, application of AI - even as he argued that any war with China would be decided by these technologies, and Chinese ""sitting inside India"" is a result of its advantage in new technologies and production. ""China has a 10-year lead on India...,"" he said.Slamming the President's joint address to Parliament, Rahul said instead of furnishing the same ""laundry list"" of things heard year after year under PM Modi, an INDIA bloc govt would give a vision for the future by exhorting the youth to embrace the new technology ""revolution"". In contrast, he said India rode the wave of the ""last revolution"" of computers in the 1980s because, under Congress, the govt had a clear vision about it. He listed ""technology and production, caste census and defence of the Constitution"" as priority for Congress.With caste survey of Congress-governed Telangana just out, Rahul said 90% of the state population belongs to SC/ST/OBC/minorities, and conjectured that OBCs nationally are over 50% of the population. In contrast, he said the ownership patterns of corporations and media houses do not reflect the demographic pie. He said a caste census would help the country in ensuring ""participation"", while use of AI on census data would make a ""social revolution"". As he claimed the SC/ST/OBC MPs in BJP are not empowered to speak, ministers asked him if he could not see the OBC PM.Rahul's speech, focussing on ""alternative vision"" as envisioned in an INDIA bloc govt's presidential address, was a departure from his style of past when he has relied on sharp, shrill political critique of the govt, laden with pithy monikers that became buzzwords to target Modi govt like ""hum do, hamare do"", ""suit boot ki sarkar"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said foreign minister S Jaishankar went to Washington to lobby for an invite for PM Modi for the US president's inauguration.

His official engagements are scheduled to take place over the next 2 days, with the summit likely on February 13.Modi will travel to France next week to co-chair an AI summit that President Emmanuel Macron is hosting on February 10-11. While Trump too had been invited for the summit, the US is likely to be represented in the meeting by Vice President JD Vance.With Trump not travelling to Paris, the bilateral summit with Modi will now take place in the US capital. Trump in fact had confirmed last week, after a phone conversation with the PM, that he would be visiting the White House in February.In what was their first conversation since the January 20 inauguration, Trump had raised the 2 possible sticking points in ties - trade and illegal immigration - while pledging cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what’s right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in only the first month of Trump’s second term. Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned till now for the PM to participate in. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn’t ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the government will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn’t work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that would restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the 2 sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","PM Narendra Modi will travel to Washington from Paris on February 12 for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump after the latter’s inauguration last month.

"Trump's USAID funds freeze set to hit India health, education projects hard",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-usaid-funds-freeze-set-to-hit-india-health-education-projects-hard/articleshow/117898469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following the issuance of an executive order by President Donald Trump to review US foreign assistance and align them with the policies of the new administration, US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work until further notice. The move has raised concerns among those engaged with USAID-funded projects in India.The biggest impact is expected on health-related programmes where USAID funds have been seen to have bolstered technical support to grassroots-level outreach. Other sectors where impacts going forward are likely to be felt include education, gender and climate change. Though USAID has a small footprint in India, the prospect of its engagement shrinking further comes at a time when global aid has considerably dropped, and can compound the financial troubles facing NGOs in development.USAID's directive to partners including voluntary organisations and agencies steering projects for govts, make it clear that they must minimise expenditure on the collaborations during the pause period. ""The recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer (USAID) that this award suspension has been cancelled,"" the directive states. It is learnt from sources in the development sector that the 'stop work' orders come with the caveat of a 90-day period during which the existing grants will be reviewed.""But the uncertainty is causing panic,"" a development practitioner said on conditions of anonymity while asserting that her organisation is able to continue work as there are other donors.According to the USAID website, as of Jan 2021, the agency was supporting mother and child health initiatives in six states with a focus on improving maternal and child health services. It was also funding initiatives to improve health by advancing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in several cities, and in addition to this, partnered with states and private agencies to support programmes preventing gender-based violence and protecting and supporting the disabled population.According to development sector professionals, the civil society has already been feeling the heat of a funds crunch with sources of global aid slowly drying up over the decades. Moreover, the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act restrictions in recent years have made it harder for local organisations to get foreign donations.Harsh Jaitli, CEO of Voluntary Action Network India, which is a network of 600 civil society organisations, said USAID pause on funding is part of a larger global trend with big agencies from Sweden, Germany and UK cutting down on aid to countries.However, smaller civil society organisations working at the grassroots level largely remain unimpacted by the USAID directive as the agency support is largely seen in big programmes like combating tuberculosis and outreach on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). According to those working in the sector, since 2004, USAID has been largely supporting technical work on the projects steered by govts.",US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work until further notice. The move has raised concerns among those engaged with USAID-funded projects in India. The biggest impact is expected on health-related programmes where USAID funds have been seen to have bolstered technical support.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117898579,imgsize-828808,width-400,resizemode-4/117898579.jpg"
SC to government: Don't do anything that shrinks forests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-government-dont-do-anything-that-shrinks-forests/articleshow/117898468.cms,"NEW DELHI: As amendments brought by Centre in the Forest (Conservation) Act has allegedly resulted in 1.97 lakh square km of land getting excluded from forest area, Supreme Court on Monday restrained central and state govts from doing anything which would lead to reduction of forest area in the country. It said even in cases in which some forest land is to be used for some urgent need, then alternative land must be provided for reforestation.While issuing notice to Centre on a petition challenging the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Rules, 2023, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran clarified that it would not permit anything which leads to reduction of forest area.""We further order that until further orders, no steps will be taken by the Union of India and any state which will lead to reduction of forest land,"" the bench said. It said in cases where use of forest area was urgent for any reasons, including for strategic purposes on border areas, then compensatory land must be provided so that the forest area remains the same.The court was hearing a batch of petitions, including one filed by a group of retired Indian Forest Officers, which have challenged the amendment, alleging that it resulted in vast tracts of forests losing legal protection and becoming vulnerable to be used for non-forest purposes.The petitioners alleged that the change in the law would ""radically undermine India's decades-old forest governance regime"" and also violate the apex court ruling by curtailing the definition of forest land that will fall within its ambit. Senior advocate Gopal Sankarnarayanan and lawyer Kaushik Choudhury, appearing for them, said a statutory mechanism has been put in place by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) purportedly to increase tree cover but this will be extremely damaging to India's forest cover.""The mechanism, which emerges from four regulatory instruments passed by the ministry, has been designed with the primary intention of facilitating hassle-free diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes, with little concern for the adverse impacts of exposing the country's valuable forest lands to market-based mechanisms,"" they said.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Centre, said govt would respond to the allegation levelled by the petitioners and sought three weeks' time. She also assured the court to file a status report on declared forest area in the country on the next date of hearing.Challenging the amendment, the petitioners said that the new definition of forest has left the most vulnerable forest areas of India unprotected and the 2023 Amendment removes protections provided earlier to vast tracts of forest land and restricts protections only to declared and notified forest under the Indian Forest Act.","Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran restrained central and state govts from doing anything which would lead to reduction of forest area.

NMC agrees to hear patients' pleas on state council rulings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-agrees-to-hear-patients-pleas-on-state-council-rulings/articleshow/117898172.cms,"Representative photo

In a victory for patients' rights, the National Medical Commission has decided that it will take up appeals of patients in cases against doctors. For almost five years, since the NMC was constituted in Sept 2020, it has been rejecting patients' appeals stating that only doctors have the right to appeal against decisions of state medical councils . However, the NMC decision is yet to be made public.The minutes of the NMC meeting held on Sept 23, 2024, obtained through the right to information, showed that the NMC had agreed that all appeals received by its Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) will be entertained. In case of action not being taken by state councils on complaints filed by non-medicos (read patients or their families) even after issuance of reminders by the boards, it was decided that EMRB may take over the complaint/matter from the state council and dispose of it.The NMC was refusing to hear patients' appeal citing section 30(3) of the NMC Act 2019 . The Section states: A medical practitioner or professional who is aggrieved by any action taken by a State Medical Council under sub-section (2) may prefer an appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB)against such action, and the decision..."" Citing this section the EMRB and the NMC stated that the law only allowed medical practitioners aggrieved by decisions of state councils to appeal.""I have been repeatedly arguing that patients have the right to appeal against decisions of state medical council under the ethics regulations of 2002, which have been in force all through,"" said Dr KV Babu an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who has been following up the issue through RTI applications and complaints to the ministry and the NMC since 2022. The clause allowing patients to appeal was added to the ethics regulations of 2002 following a Supreme Court order.Responding to several complaints from patients, the health ministry added a provision for patients to appeal in the draft of the National Medical Commission (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was made public in Dec 2022. However, the bill has remained in limbo.In Aug 2023, the NMC brought in a new ethics code to replace the ethics regulation of 2002. However, in the face of protests from doctors and the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, the new regulations were held in abeyance and the NMC reiterated that the old regulations would be applicable. However, patients' appeals continued to be rejected.""The NMC Act states that 'the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder'. The ethics code was not replaced by the NMC, except briefly in Aug 2023. Otherwise, the 2002 regulations have been in operation right from the inception of the NMC. So, the NMC's decision to disallow appeals of non-doctors was always illegal. I am happy that finally better sense has prevailed,"" said Dr Babu. Over the years, over a hundred patient appeals have been rejected.","The National Medical Commission has decided that it will take up appeals of patients in cases against doctors.

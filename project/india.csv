NEW DELHI: Multiple flash floods were reported on Sunday across Mandi district, including Panarsa, Takoli and Nagwain along the Mandi-Kullu stretch of the Chandigarh-Manali National Highway. The highway has been blocked at several points, bringing traffic to a standstill and causing major disruption.Incessant heavy rainfall and a cloudburst have triggered flash floods in the region, with visuals showing torrents of muddy water rushing through affected areas. Authorities said no casualties have been reported so far. “No reports of human loss have been received in the incidents,” Sachin Hiremath, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Mandi, told news agency ANI. Police are maintaining a strict vigil at vulnerable sites while restoration work is underway to reopen the highway and restore traffic.The flash floods come as Himachal Pradesh continues to grapple with one of its most destructive monsoon seasons in recent years. According to the State Disaster Management Authority (HPSDMA), 261 deaths have been recorded between 20 June and 16 August 2025. Of these, 136 people lost their lives in rain-related incidents such as landslides, drowning, electrocution, house collapses and flash floods, while 125 died in road accidents.Mandi district has recorded the highest casualties, with 26 deaths, along with severe damage to public infrastructure. Other badly affected districts include Kangra (28 deaths), Kullu (11 deaths) and Chamba (10 deaths). The HPSDMA report estimates losses worth over Rs 2,14,457 lakh this monsoon, with roads, water supply, agriculture, horticulture and electricity infrastructure hit hardest. The Public Works Department alone has reported losses exceeding Rs 1.18 lakh crore, while agriculture and horticulture have suffered combined losses of over RS 83,000 crore.Connectivity remains a major concern, with frequent blockages along key highways including NH-05 (Kinnaur) and NH-305 (Kullu). Many interior villages remain cut off for days, hampering rescue and relief operations.The report also highlights widespread destruction of homes, with 278 houses fully damaged, 288 partially damaged and 703 cowsheds destroyed. Over 27,000 animals and birds have perished. Officials said restoring essential services remains a priority, though persistent rainfall and recurring landslides are slowing progress. Residents have been urged to remain cautious, avoid unnecessary travel and follow weather advisories as the monsoon season is set to continue for several more weeks.","Multiple flash floods reported on Sunday across Mandi district, including Panarsa, Takoli and Nagwain along the Mandi-Kullu stretch of the Chandigarh- Manali National Highway.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi to finalize the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate for the upcoming Vice-Presidential election, scheduled for September 9.The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , will include key leaders such as Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and BJP President J.P. Nadda, among others. The NDA has authorized Modi and Nadda to select the candidate for this critical constitutional post, with the decision expected to be endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).The urgency to select a candidate follows the abrupt resignation of former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons, though speculations of political differences had surfaced. Sources indicate that the BJP is keen on choosing a candidate deeply rooted in the BJP-RSS ecosystem, with names like Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot, Sikkim Governor Om Mathur, and Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha being considered.Devvrat, a Jat community member, is a strong contender to appease the community, while Gehlot’s selection could bolster the BJP’s outreach to backward caste voters.The NDA, with its majority in the electoral college comprising Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members, is poised for an easy victory if the election is contested. The opposition INDIA bloc may field a candidate, with discussions slated for August 18. Meanwhile, all NDA Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers have been summoned to Delhi on August 21 for the nomination filing, signaling a unified front. The decision on Sunday is expected to reflect strategic political calculations, balancing caste dynamics and RSS influence.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi.

Constitutional authorities are expected to be the epitome of probity - not hide behind vaguely drafted press notes to hide their guilt in destroying democracy,” Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said in a post on X.Venugopal said that the burden of identifying large-scale discrepancies in voter data cannot be placed solely on political parties and their booth-level agents.He questioned the commission’s claims of “utmost transparency” in electoral roll preparation and listed several concerns, including denial of machine-readable rolls, deletion of CCTV footage within 45 days, the EC’s submission before the Supreme Court regarding the deletion of 65 lakh names in Bihar, and its refusal to meet opposition MPs.Sharing the EC’s recent press note, he said, “The tone and tenor of this press note raises greater suspicions that the ECI will take no steps to address the public’s grave concerns about mass scale vote rigging done by the BJP-controlled ECI.”Responding to opposition allegations, the election commission said the appropriate time for political parties to flag errors is during the claims and objections period after draft electoral rolls are published.“It seems that some political parties and their booth level agents (BLAs) did not examine the electoral rolls at the appropriate time and did not point out errors, if any,” the EC said in its statement.The commission also noted that certain parties and individuals have recently raised questions about errors in both current and past electoral rolls.","The party demanded that the poll body explain why it continues to deny political parties access to machine-readable electoral rolls and CCTV footage. “The ECI has crossed all limits of shamelessness by shrugging all its responsibilities in the face of grave allegations of vote theft and mass rigging,” Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123341917,imgsize-998732,width-400,resizemode-4/123341917.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups.Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI.She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure.""So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money,"" she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor . “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money.So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks.PM Modi further criticised the Indus Water Treaty , calling it “unjust and one-sided,” and declared that “blood and water cannot flow together,” promising India’s farmers full rights over the country’s river waters.",Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events.

NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Office is likely to shift from South Block to the newly built Executive Enclave-I - a few hundred metres away - next month, sources said. Soon, the Cabinet Secretariat will also shift from Rashtrapati Bhavan to this new office complex, which is also likely to get a new name.Ministries of home affairs and personnel have almost been shifted to Kartavya Bhawan-3, which PM Narendra Modi inaugurated earlier this month. TOI has learnt that PMO may move in the second half of Sept.Officials said going by the trend of govt naming all Central Vista projects, such as Ka-rtavya Path (earlier Raj Path) and Kartavya Bhawan, signifying a change in its approach, Executive Enclave-I may also get a name, something linked to 'service' (sewa).In his address to PMO officials after taking oath for the third consecutive time as PM, Modi had said, ""PMO should become an institution of service and the people's PMO"" and that it should serve as a catalytic agent, generating new energy to provide light to the entire system.Shifting of offices from North Block and South Block to new buildings is crucial as the govt is keen to expedite the conversion of these two iconic buildings into a public museum called 'Yuge Yugeen Bharat Sangrahalaya'.The Prime Minister had recently said that this will allow every citizen to witness and experience India's rich civilisational journey.The British-era North Block and South Block buildings have been the power centre for nearly 80 years, housing offices of the Prime Minister, and ministries of defence, home, external affairs and finance.A govt source, who was earlier involved in the master planning of the Central Vista revamp project, told TOI that one of the main rationale behind shifting these top offices, which make national policies, from these two buildings was to remove traces of colonial mindset.",Prime Minister's Office likely to shift from South Block to Executive Enclave-I next month.

Today is Janmashtami—a midnight memory that India has refused to forget for over two millennia. It marks the birth of Krishna , the eighth avatar of Vishnu , born not in a palace but in a prison, smuggled across the Yamuna in a storm while his uncle Kansa plotted murder in Mathura. The story is old, but not stale. Its blueprint lies in the Puranas—the Bhagavata and the Harivamsa—but its afterlife lives in every bhajan, Dahi Handi pyramid, classroom skit and sleepy-eyed midnight arati. Krishna isn’t just butter-thief and flute-player; he’s strategist, moral dissenter, and the only god who argues back. Janmashtami celebrates not just a divine birth but the idea that when injustice becomes law, God arrives as disruption. The festival teaches courage over convenience, joy over fear, and that sometimes, truth arrives dressed in mischief. If you think you know your Krishna—his, his teachings, his hidden footprints across temples and texts—here’s your chance to test it.

F-1 visa rejections explained: Why students face refusals and how to overcome them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/f-1-visa-rejections-explained-why-students-face-refusals-and-how-to-overcome-them/articleshow/123329042.cms,"What does a 214(b) refusal mean?

Understanding strong ties to your home country

Family responsibilities and relationships



Employment or ongoing education



Ownership of property or other financial commitments



Active participation in your local community

Is a 214(b) refusal permanent?

How to strengthen your next application

Submit a new visa application and pay the fee again.

Prepare for a fresh interview, emphasising any updates or changes in your situation.

Provide clear evidence of strong ties, such as employment letters, family commitments, property documents, or new financial resources.

A positive change on the horizon

For many international students, getting a US student visa is the first big hurdle on the road to studying abroad. Yet, a significant number of applicants are refused, often leaving them puzzled and disappointed. One of the most common reasons cited for refusal is Section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs nonimmigrant visas such as the F-1 student visa.If your F-1 visa is denied under Section 214(b), it usually means the consular officer was not convinced either that you meet the visa requirements or that you intend to return to your home country after your studies. In short, the officer could not see enough evidence of your ties back home.It’s worth noting that certain work visas, like H-1B or L visas, do not require applicants to prove such ties.“Strong ties” refer to the personal, professional, or social connections that link you to your country. Examples include:Consular officers evaluate each application individually, considering these ties along with your travel plans and financial situation. The goal is to ensure you will leave the U.S. once your temporary stay ends.No. A Section 214(b) rejection applies only to the specific application that was denied. You are free to reapply at any time, especially if there have been meaningful changes in your circumstances or if you have new information to share.While there is no formal appeal, students can take steps to improve their chances on reapplication:In 2025, Congresswomen Veronica Escobar and María Elvira Salazar, along with 20 other lawmakers, introduced the DIGNITY Act, which aims to make F-1 visas allow dual intent. If approved, this would help students pursue studies without being automatically presumed to have immigrant intent, potentially reducing 214(b) refusals.A 214(b) refusal is not the end of the road. By understanding the reasons behind it and strengthening ties to your home country, you can improve your chances in the next visa application. With careful preparation, many students are still able to realise their dream of studying in the United States.","Section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act governs nonimmigrant visas such as the F-1 student visa.

NEW DELHI: Even though the Trump-Putin Alaska summit concluded without an agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war, India appreciated the ""progress"" made in the meeting between the US and Russian presidents, saying in an official statement their leadership in the pursuit of peace is ""highly commendable"".The Indian govt is hoping that Trump's claims about great progress being made in Alaska, and the talk about a comprehensive peace agreement even in the absence of a ceasefire, will ease the US pressure on India to review its energy ties with Russia.India welcomes the summit meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, said the Indian govt. ""India appreciates the progress made in the summit. The way forward can only be through dialogue and diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine,"" it added.Facing an additional 25% tariff/secondary sanctions from the US for its energy imports from Russia, India would have liked to see a quick end to the war in Ukraine as it would have rendered these sanctions untenable. The Trump administration imposed the additional tariffs, which will come into effect on Aug 27, accusing the Indian govt of funding Russia's war on Ukraine.Just before the meeting, Trump said Russia had lost India as its ""oil client"" suggesting the US could do a rethink on the secondary sanctions issue. After the meeting, asked whether he still planned to penalise countries like China for trade with Russia, Trump said because of what happened in the summit with Putin, he didn't have to think about it. ""Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well,"" said Trump, raising hopes that secondary sanctions on India too may not be implemented.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent raised the stakes for India, ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, by saying the sanctions on India could go up if the Alaska meeting did not go well. India sees these sanctions as unreasonable and unjustified as other countries importing from Russia have been spared such action.An agency report from New York said Trump had signalled he won't impose additional tariffs on India as he had said that Russia just lost an ""oil client"" in India.""Well, he (Putin) lost an oil client, so to speak, which is India, which was doing about 40% of the oil. China, as you know, is doing a lot...And, if I did what's called a secondary sanction, or a secondary tariff, it would be very devastating from their standpoint. If I have to do it, I'll do it.

‘Important to timely counter misinformation drive that has reached absurd level’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) will hold a press conference here on Sunday to put across a “point-by-point counter” to what it calls misinformation being spread by a few opposition parties regarding the past and ongoing revision of electoral roll in certain states, sources in the poll panel told TOI.The event coincides with the start of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ that will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across Bihar.EC and the state chief electoral officers concerned have repeatedly countered allegations of ‘vote chori’ — levelled by Rahul at a press conference on Aug 7 and echoed by many opposition parties — through a series of ‘fact-check’ posts on social media. But this is the first time that Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi will directly rebut what EC sources termed “misinformation” and “lies” being spread by parties that are “involved at each stage of preparation of the roll” and “get appropriate time and opportunity to rectify errors both before and after publication of the electoral roll”.EC sources pointed out that though the allegations of voter roll discrepancies were raised by Rahul Gandhi more than a year after the relevant elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana, the CEOs concerned had offered to probe them, provided he, as required by the law, furnished a signed declaration affirming the claimed errors to be true.The Congress MP has declined to submit an affidavit.“It is, thus, important to timely counter the misinformation campaign that has now reached absurd levels with the use of artificial intelligencegenerated content to mislead the people and shake voter confidence in the electoral system,” a functionary told TOI.EC reiterated Saturday the election system for parliamentary and assembly poll is a multi-layered, decentralised construct as per law, with sub division magistrate (SDM)- level officers doubling as electoral registration officers (EROs), to prepare and finalise the roll with the help of booth level officers (BLOs). EROs and BLOs take responsibility for correctness of the roll.After publication of the draft electoral roll, its digital and physical copies are shared with all political parties and put on ECI website.Electors and parties can file claims and objections for one month before the final roll is published. Even after this, two-tiered appeals may be filed, first with DM and then with CEO. “It seems some political parties and their booth level agents did not examine the electoral rolls at the appropriate time (during claims and objections and then, the appeal period) and did not point out errors, if any, to SDMs/EROs, DEOs or CEOs,” EC said, adding if done at the “right time through the right channels, it would have enabled the SDM/ERO to correct the mistakes, if genuine, before those elections”.",The event coincides with the start of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ That will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across Bihar.

NEW DELHI: NCERT's newly released Partition Horrors Remembrance Day modules have triggered a political storm by explicitly naming Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Congress and then Viceroy Lord Mountbatten as ""culprits"" behind India's division in 1947.The supplementary modules - separate versions for classes VI-VIII and IX-XII - are not part of regular textbooks but designed for discussions, debates and projects.

Millions of our sisters and brothers were displaced and many lost their lives due to mindless hate and violence. ""In a section titled ""Who Was Responsible for Partition?"", the secondary-stage module states: ""Historically, three actors were responsible for Partition: 1. Jinnah, who demanded it. 2. The Congress, which accepted it. 3. Mountbatten, who formalised and implemented it."" The text criticises Mountbatten for advancing the transfer of power from June 1948 to Aug 1947. ""Due to it many essential arrangements that should have preceded Partition were never completed.The Partition became disorderly and chaotic.""The framing has drawn sharp criticism, with Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera rejecting the NCERT's narrative.

"Don't contest nearly every AFT ruling, HC tells Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-contest-nearly-every-aft-ruling-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/123340193.cms,"Delhi HC

CHANDIGARH: Delhi HC has cautioned the Centre against its persistent practice of contesting nearly every Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) ruling that grants pensionary relief to soldiers, saying the government should in appropriate cases ""graciously"" accept the tribunal's decision rather than prolong needless litigation.""Not every perceived dispute must be turned into an adversarial battle in the courts,"" a division bench of Justice C Hari Shankar and Justice Om Prakash Shukla observed while dismissing a petition filed by the Centre against an AFT order.The Centre had challenged the decision of the principal bench of AFT, Delhi, that granted special family pension to the widow of Major Sanjeev Chadha, who was found dead in the bathroom 25 years ago, detecting it as a case of brain haemorrhage due to hypertension.On Nov 3, 2023, the tribunal had directed authorities not to adopt any ""mechanical or hyper-technical"" approach to deny relief. Aggrieved, the Centre argued that Major Chadha's death was neither attributable to nor aggravated by service.Counsel for the applicant, Chaitanya Aggarwal, said Major Chadha joined the Army in June 1988 and died on Sept 3, 2000, while posted in New Delhi. The cause of death was recorded as intracerebral haemorrhage.He stressed that the officer neither smoked nor drank, had no family history of hypertension, and had served in stressful conditions across field and peace postings.While rejecting the central govt's plea, the high court noted Chadha was not diagnosed with hypertension at the time of joining service. After 12 years in uniform, he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and died.""We have seen the postmortem report. It merely states Major Chadha died due to ICH from hypertension.

NEW DELHI: In a blazing response to Supreme Court 's judgment fixing deadlines for President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies, Centre on Saturday warned impermissible invasion of constitutionally conferred high plenary zone on the top constitutional post holders by SC in the garb of judicial review powers would destabilise the balance of powers among the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.""A wide-ranging judicial review of assent procedures, either post-assent or at a stage anterior to the grant of assent, would potentially destabilise the constitutional balance between organs of State. It would create an institutional hierarchy and upset the constitutional balance of powers between the three organs,"" it said, adding the judiciary does not hold keys or solutions for every conundrum that may arise in a democratic society.Objecting to the manner in which SC used its exclusive powers under Article 142 to arrogate itself the power to amend the Constitution to fix deadlines for the President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills and grant ""deemed assent"" to 10 Tamil Nadu bills, the Centre said, ""Article 142 does not empower the court to create a concept of 'deemed assent', turning the constitutional & legislative process on its head.In its written submissions filed Saturday in support of President Droupadi Murmu's reference raising 14 queries to situations arising after the contentious Apr 8 judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, Centre said exercising judicial powers over decisions of the President and governors in relation to bills would confer supremacy on judiciary, which is against the Constitution's basic structure, a red line that cannot be crossed by any organ of governance.""The classical notion of judicial review cannot be lifted and applied to assent as the factors at play during the grant or withholding of assent have no legal or constitutional parallel. The unique duality of assent thus deserves a uniquely calibrated judicial approach,"" it said. It said each of the three organs of governance derive power from the Constitution, which does not assign any higher pedigree or superiority to any one organ that would enable judiciary to relegate the high position of gubernatorial post to a subservient one. Issues relating to bills, with regard to decisions of the President and governors, ""deserve political answers and not necessarily judicial,"" the Centre said.Certain political questions may arise in the exercise of the core functions of any of the three organs, and these would have been answered through democratic remedies under the Constitution. The judiciary, in the zest of finding a solution to every problem, cannot brush aside the essential constitutional feature of separation of powers, the Centre said.Though some overlap has happened over the years despite clear separation of powers envisaged by the Constitution, the powers and limitations of these three organs flow from the same constitutional text without ascribing ""any higher pedigree or superior legitimacy to any organ"", it said. Notwithstanding the overlap, certain zones remain exclusive to each - Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, it said, adding none can trench upon the domain exclusive to another. Disapproving the manner in which the Tamil Nadu governor was treated in SC's Apr 8 judgment, the Centre said governors are not foreigners in states, not just emissaries of the Centre but represent national interest and democratic will in states as part of national fraternity.""When the Constitution seeks to impose time limits for taking certain decisions, it specifically mentions such time limits. On the other hand, when it designedly sought to keep the exercise of powers flexible, it did not impose any fixed time limit. Since the text of Art 200 or 201, does not provide a specific time limit, no form of judicial review or judicial interpretation can impose the same."" it said.",Supreme Court's judgment fixing deadlines for President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies.

CHANDIGARH: Opposition parties in Punjab have urged the Election Commission to take action against AAP and its Punjab in-charge, Manish Sisodia, over a social media video where he allegedly tells party workers that AAP would resort to “saam, daam, dand, bhed… ladai, jhagda” to win the 2027 assembly election.Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar has written to the Chief Election Commissioner to file an FIR against Sisodia, disqualify him from future elections and bar him from giving speeches. Shiromani Akali Dal has demanded that AAP be barred from contesting elections in Punjab. The AAP leadership, however, says Sisodia’s words have been taken out of context and that the clip is being used to misrepresent his speech. The video is purportedly from a speech Sisodia gave at an AAP women’s wing leadership training programme in Mohali on Aug 13.""2027 ki chunav jitwane ke liye saam, daam, dand, bhed, sach, jhoot, question-answer, ladai-jhagda, jo karna padega karenge.

Whatever we have to do, we will do. Are you ready? With passion? Very good),” he purportedly says in the video.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP Punjab president Aman Arora were present during Sisodia’s speech, and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had addressed the event virtually.An AAP politician told TOI that the “brief, one-minute video does not convey the full meaning or entire thought process” of what Sisodia was trying to communicate. “Ironically, the theme of the training programme was to prepare party workers to counter the very type of false propaganda that is now being spread via this clip. The address was part of an internal party meeting and was not livestreamed,” he said, suggesting that “someone recorded the video and edited this clip out of context”.The video has put Punjab politics on the boil, though. Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar accused Sisodia of openly advocating corrupt and violent practices to win the polls. On Saturday, he wrote to the CEC demanding an FIR against Sisodia, saying his words “clearly reveal AAP’s intent to undermine the democratic process”.“These statements amount to an open admission of intent to adopt corrupt practices, intimidate voters, spread enmity, and disturb public order in the state, thereby threatening the peace, development and prosperity of Punjab,” his letter claims. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal shared the clip on social media, and urged EC to take “strong notice of Sisodia’s highly provocative statements and get his bail cancelled”. “AAP’s cat has finally been let out of the bag. The mask has been removed from their faces. To remain in power in Punjab in 2027, AAP’s deceptions, lies, false promises, and cheap tactics — including riots, violence, and the game of money — have all been shamelessly and openly admitted by their Delhi-based leader, Manish Sisodia,” Sukhbir Singh Badal claimed. “In view of this brazen admission, AAP must be debarred in Punjab to save this sensitive border state from a repeat of the dangerous past. I also urge strict and prompt legal action against him (Sisodia) for inciting fraternal bloodshed in Punjab,” SAD president wrote.State Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring took a dig at Sisodia for “revealing your intentions and exposing your designs”. “Sisodia is miserably mistaken about Punjab and Punjabis. If he believes that AAP can win by resorting to the tactics he mentioned in his speech, he is living in a fool’s paradise.

The mission launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 25.Ahead of his return, Shukla posted an emotional note on X, writing:""As I sit on the plane to come back to India I have a mix of emotions running through my heart.

I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is - everything all at once.He added that his commander, veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson, often reminded him:During his stay aboard the ISS, Shukla conducted multiple scientific experiments.

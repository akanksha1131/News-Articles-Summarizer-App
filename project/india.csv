NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah on Thursday joined a group of singers to perform the devotional song, ""Tune Mujhe Bulaya Sherawaliye, Main Aaya Main Aaya Sherawaliye.""The NC leader was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra. He was seen donning a traditional red-coloured scarf associated with the shrine.During the event, Abdullah addressed the contentious issue of the ropeway construction project in Katra, voicing his support for local residents protesting against it. He targeted the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board for proceeding with the project without adequately considering the interests of the community.""Those running the shrine's operations should not take actions that harm the interests of the local people or create problems for them,"" Abdullah said. He praised the residents of Katra for their resilience in opposing the project, saying, ""You showed courage and fought bravely to stop it. They have realised that power lies with the people, not the government.""Former J&K CM also highlighted the power of collective action, pointing out that the people have the ultimate authority to shape or dismantle governments. He mentioned that officials are now consulting the community to determine a more suitable location for the ropeway.He also expressed concern for locals who rely on the shrine for their livelihood. ""The people living in these hills come here to earn their livelihood with the blessings of Mata, but they have been forgotten. Those in power think they are everything, but they are not. When the power of God prevails, all else fades. Just look at what is happening in California,"" he said.Abdullah also mentioned the universality of religious teachings, saying that all faiths share common core values but are often misused by individuals for personal gain.","Farooq Abdullah was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra.

HC acquits man convicted by Pocso court of raping daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-acquits-man-convicted-by-pocso-court-of-raping-daughter/articleshow/117503073.cms,"NAGPUR: Bombay HC's Nagpur bench recently overturned an Amravati Pocso court order convicting a 43-year-old man of sexually assaulting his daughter for seven years until she turned 14. Justice Govinda Sanap suggested a possible motive behind the allegations, saying the father opposed his daughter's marriage to a youth of her choice, who she married shortly after the rape case was filed by her grandmother in Jan 2019.""It's true that in ordinary circumstances, a daughter would not level such an allegation against her father. Similarly, a father would also not sexually assault his daughter. However, considering human psychology and tendency, mistakes can occur, even in the case of the father, who is ordinarily considered as protector of the children,"" Justice Sanap said.While quashing the Pocso court's Feb 2021 judgment that sentenced the father to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 5,000, HC said the girl ""and her boyfriend were in an intimate relationship"", but her father deemed him an unsuitable match. This disagreement fuelled her distress, possibly prompting her to ""lodge a false report"" against the father, the judge said.""Except her words, there is no other evidence. Even if it is presumed the man was addicted to liquor as per the daughter's allegation, it would not weigh in favour of the prosecution. She has nowhere stated that her father did not look after their well-being,"" HC said.""The father who looked after the survivor in the absence of her mother would not perpetrate such an act with his daughter.

""If something is not received well, and it is inappropriate and felt as unwelcome behaviour affecting the other sex, namely the women, no doubt it would fall under the definition of sexual harassment,"" HC added, citing a US court judgment.The definition of sexual harassment, as seen from the PoSH Act, has given significance to the act more than the intention behind the same, Justice Manjula said.""It is the fundamental discipline and understanding with which employees of different genders are expected to interact with each other where decency is the yardstick and nothing else. While speaking about decency, it is not the decency which the offender thinks within himself but how he makes the other gender feel about his actions,"" Justice Manjula said. The standard of reasonableness is not the standard of a reasonable man but the standard of a reasonable woman, she clarified.Justice Manjula made the observations while quashing an order of a labour court that overturned the findings of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of HCL Technologies passed against one of its senior employees.Three women employees subordinate to the accused senior employee lodged complaints with the ICC saying that he abused his supervisory position and harassed them by standing closely behind them while they were working, touching their shoulders, and insisting on handshakes.The man claimed that since he was required to monitor his subordinates' work without disturbing them, he would observe their work standing behind them.

"Brand bar lifted, Kolkata's yellow 'kings of the road' set to stay on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brand-bar-lifted-kolkatas-yellow-kings-of-the-road-set-to-stay-on/articleshow/117502032.cms,"KOLKATA: Yellow taxis are here to stay in Kolkata, but the future may not be Ambassador. State govt has allowed all light commercial vehicles with taxi permits to be painted yellow, in a move aimed at preserving the cultural identity of an iconic mode of city transport. A 'light commercial vehicle', as per road rules, is any vehicle that can carry between three and six passengers. Hitherto, any such vehicle, which also had a taxi permit, could only be painted white.State govt's rule tweak - under Notification No. 3112-WT, issued by issued by transport secretary Saumitra Mohan - came in response to calls from various quarters to allow more flexibility in light passenger vehicles' colour scheme.Kolkata's yellow taxis, introduced in 1962 with Hindustan Motors' Ambassador cars, have been a cultural staple for decades. Referred to as the ""kings of the road"" for their reliability and charm, these taxis once dominated the city's transport landscape. However, their numbers have sharply declined - from 18,000 a decade ago to just 7,000 in 2024. With 4,493 vehicles scheduled to be phased out this year because of the mandatory 15-year service limit for commercial vehicles, fewer than 3,000 yellow taxis will remain by end-2025, it has been estimated. The 15-year age limit, enforced after a 2008 Calcutta HC order, has ensured adherence to green standards, but it also hastened the end of the Ambassador, the last of which was manufactured in 2014.Nostalgia aside, yellow taxis have struggled to compete with app-based cab-hailing services, which offer greater convenience and affordability, and technological advancements. Dynamic pricing and GPS tracking, among other options, have significantly reshaped Kolkata's urban commute. Experts viewed govt's move as a ""happy compromise"" - one that balances the need to preserve the city's heritage with the demands of a modern transportation system. ""Yellow taxis are an integral part of Kolkata's identity, and this decision ensures their continuation while addressing the practicalities of modern commuting,"" said Sourish Ghosh, a transport historian.Also, by allowing new car models to adopt the iconic yellow, govt has ensured that a certain part of the city's cultural identity will endure, even though the days of the Ambassador taxi may be numbered. Additionally, companies, firms or individuals who register 20 or more vehicles in a month can now choose custom colours, insignia or rooftop designs, subject to transport department's approval.","Kolkata's yellow taxis introduced in 1962 with Hindustan Motors' Ambassador cars.

KOLKATA: Father of Shariful Fakir, the illegal Bangladeshi immigrant arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home, claimed that police have framed his son. He said Shariful is not the person shown in the video from the initial CCTV footage released the day after the attack.""They have arrested my son as a suspect, but he is not the one whose photograph police had released after the incident. The man in the photograph had long hair that touched his eyes. My son has always had shorter hair raised upwards. They have picked him up as he has some similarities. He is also an easy target as he had entered India illegally,"" Md Rohul Amin, 55, told TOI over a WhatsApp call from Bangladesh.Amin, who is also a village-level Bangladesh Nationalist Party functionary, said he is speaking to senior politicians in his country to raise the ""false arrest"" of his son as a diplomatic issue. Shariful is the second among Rohul's three sons. While his elder son works at a private firm in Dhaka, the younger son is still in school. Shariful dropped out from school after Class 10 and started doing odd jobs after Rohul lost his job at Khulna jute mill.""We may be poor, but we are not criminals. In Bangladesh, he used to ride a bike taxi for a living. But during the era of Awami League, there was a lot of political turmoil in our village and after Sheikh Hasina's govt came back to power early last year. Since my son was an active supporter of Khaleda Zia, he faced immense backlash and so he decided to leave Bangladesh for better earning and living prospects,"" said Rohul.He said Shariful got in touch with an agent who helped him illegally cross the border and enter India in April last year. While Mumbai police said he crossed Dawki river to reach Meghalaya and then reach Bengal via Assam, his father couldn't specify the details. ""He hadn't shared with us about how he had exactly entered India but there are multiple persons like him who leave Bangladesh and head for India illegally for work. Once he reached India, he went to Bengal and worked at a restaurant for a few days, before he went to Mumbai and started working at a bar. He had also met a relative of ours in Bengal but he refused him accommodation,"" said Rohul, who now works as a farmer at Rajabaria village in Jhalokhathi of Bangladesh.Rohul said Friday evening, more than 38 hours since the stabbing incident at Saif's Bandra residence, Shariful called home and told his father that he had transferred 10,000 Bangladeshi taka via a hawala agent leaving only 3,000 taka for himself. ""We know he had done several illegal things, like straying into India and sending money illegally. He may have some politically-motivated cases against him in Bangladesh but one thing I can assure is that my son is not a criminal. He can never loot or attack someone. We demand justice,"" he said, breaking down into tears.",Shariful Fakir's father claims his son was wrongfully arrested for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan.

NEW DELHI: Actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed on January 16 at his 12th-floor apartment in the upscale Bandra area in Mumbai. As the actor underwent two surgeries, got discharged after 5 days and police arrested a Bangladeshi man in connection with the attack, several angles have come up in the last eight days along with various conspiracy angles.In a startling incident, Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan suffered multiple stab wounds from an intruder who broke into his luxury Bandra flat on the 12th floor last week. The actor was taken to nearby Lilavati Hospital in an auto.The 54-year-old actor was out of danger following an emergency surgery. Police registered a case of 'armed robbery with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt'.During the confrontation, Khan's house help, who alerted others in the house about the intruder, also received a minor hand injury. She subsequently filed an official complaint with the police.Eliyama Philip, aged 56, who works as a nurse at Khan's home, described the frightening incident. The assailant, identified as a thin-built man around his late 30s with a dark complexion, made his way into the bedroom where Saif Ali Khan's 4-year-old son, Jeh, was asleep.Armed with a stick and a sharp blade, the perpetrator first demanded Rs 1 crore from Philip. Upon her refusal, he attacked her, resulting in injuries to her wrists and hand.The disturbance alerted the nanny, Junu, who called for help, leading Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan to hurry to the location. Saif Ali Khan, while protecting his family, engaged with the assailant but suffered injuries. He received cuts on his neck, shoulder, back, and wrist. The assailant escaped before additional household staff could arrive at the scene.After being injured, the actor went to Lilavati Hospital in an auto as no driver was available at that time. The auto driver, who took Saif to the hospital said when he was passing by the Satguru Darshan building where the actor stayed, a woman and a few others asked him to stop the rickshaw.“Then the person whose white kurta was soaked in blood got in the auto. I noticed he had neck and back injuries, but did not notice the hand injury,” he said.“He (Saif) walked into the auto. There was a seven-eight year old boy who also boarded the rickshaw,” he said, when asked if the actor's son Taimur accompanied him to the hospital.“When we reached the hospital, he called out to the guard at the gate and told him: Please bring a stretcher. I am Saif Ali Khan,” he said, adding the auto reached the hospital around 3 am.Later, Saif met driver Bhajan Singh Rana to thank him for his timely help and offered him financial support.Initially, the Mumbai Police picked up a carpenter who had worked at Saif Ali Khan's flat two days before the stabbing incident. How was, however, let go the same day. Two days later, a man was held in Chhattisgarh and brought to Mumbai for questioning. Police later said he was just a suspect and later released.After a three-day manhunt, Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad was arrested and sent to five-day police custody by the court. According to police, Shehzad, a Bangladesh national, had entered the actor's house intending to commit theft. However, the situation escalated when he was spotted by a house help in the room of Saif's younger son, Jeh.Police said that the accused, who was arrested from Thane on January 19, entered the country illegally seven months ago and used a West Bengal resident's Aadhaar card to procure a SIM before moving to Mumbai.Shehzad gained access to the actor's residence by climbing over the compound wall while the security personnel were asleep, according to police reports. He accessed the premises through the main entrance, which lacked CCTV surveillance, as per a police official's statement.Upon noticing the sleeping security guards, he scaled the boundary wall. The intruder then stored his footwear in his bag to minimise noise and deactivated his mobile phone, the official added.""During the probe, the police found that there are no CCTV cameras installed in the building's corridor. The investigation revealed that one of the two security guards was sleeping in the cabin and the other near the gate,"" an official said.Initially, there were questions regarding Saif's spouse, actress Kareena Kapoor Khan's location during the incident. Later, news agency IANS reported that she was inebriated after attending a party at actress Sonam Kapoor 's house.News agency IANS reported that Kareena arrived home heavily intoxicated. Concerns about potential media exposure through leaked photographs and recordings, coupled with questions about her condition at the hospital and police station, influenced her decision to remain private. Following the incident, she sought refuge at her sister Karisma Kapoor's residence.In her statement, Kareena told authorities that while the intruder became violent during the confrontation, he left untouched the exposed jewellery.In her statement, Kareena mentioned that when the attack happened, she sent the children Taimur and Jehangir along with the women to the 12th floor. Saif tried to protect them.When Saif intervened, the attacker couldn't reach their younger son Jahangir, also called Jeh.Kareena told the police that the attacker did not steal anything from the house and was very aggressive. He attacked Saif multiple times.She added that she went to her sister Karisma’s house after the attack. “After the attack, I was terrified, so Karisma took me to her house,” she had said.The actor was finally discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. The actor was seen waving for the cameras as he reached home. The Mumbai Police is providing temporary protection to Saif, Kareena and their two kids - Taimur and Jeh.Meanwhile, the actor has added personal security cover and hired a security firm owned by actor Ronit Roy for the job. The agency workers were seen installing CCTV cameras at Saif's building entrance.Bandra police have finally recovered the final missing section of the knife that broke during the assault. The suspect had disposed of it near Bandra Talao on SV Road, approximately 1.4km from the actor's home.""A three-inch piece of the knife which got stuck inside Saif's back was recovered after it was removed during the surgery. The second small piece with blood on it was found in his house during the panchnama carried out after the crime. The final big portion with the handle was found near the talao,"" stated a Bandra police station officer.The police also took the accused to recreate the crime scene at Saif's residence. ""He showed us where he had disposed of the knife after walking 1.4km (around 25 minutes) from Saif's building. After discarding the knife, he walked 650 metres to a restaurant on Linking Road before proceeding to the bus stop outside National College where he slept. In the morning he walked to Bandra railway station to catch a train for Dadar at 8 am before heading to Worli and then to Thane,"" explained a police officer.The investigation team has obtained Fakir's clothing worn during and after the incident. ""We have recovered the shirt and cap that Fakir wore as mentioned by Saif's stay-at-home nurse, Eliyamma Phillip, in her complaint. The team also found the scarf and all pieces of the knife. The recovered material will be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory. Fakir had stolen the knife from the Thane restaurant where he worked,"" the officer concluded.Since the day of the attack, several questions have been raised regarding the stabbing incident. Questions have been raised regarding the attack being an inside job. It is said that the door was kept open for the suspect by someone already present at the home. Police, however, have found no proof of forced entry inside the house.In the latest, Maharashtra cabinet minister Nitesh Rane has raised questions about if the attack was real. Rane said, ""The way Saif came out of the hospital, I am wondering if he was really attacked or is he acting.""Meanwhile, police, while seeking custody of the accused, had also cited an international conspiracy angle in the court. Police told court that the alleged attacker was a Bangladeshi national and there was a need to find the motive behind his act. Police also told the court that they needed to find out if there was an international conspiracy linked to the case.","Saif Ali Khan was stabbed on January 16 at his 12th-floor apartment in the upscale Bandra area in Mumbai. The actor underwent two surgeries, got discharged after 5 days and police arrested a Bangladeshi man in connection with the attack. After a three-day manhunt, Sheiful Islam Shehzad was arrested and sent to five-day police custody.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117487424,imgsize-1274902,width-400,resizemode-4/117487424.jpg"

Noida land acquisition: SC seeks report in 2 months

NEW DELHI: Smelling a rat in the functioning of Noida Authority and suspecting a nexus between its officials and landowners, Supreme Court on Thursday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) comprising senior IPS officers to probe the working of the Authority as well as likely payment of ""excess compensation"" for land acquired by it.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh picked three senior UP-cadre IPS officers hailing from other states - additional DGP S B Shiradkar, CB-CID IG M Rajesh P Rao and DIG Hemant Kutiyal - to form the SIT and tasked it with also probing whether the overall functioning of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) ""lacked transparency, fairness and objectivity"".While instances of farmers not being paid adequate compensation for land acquired by the Authority were known, it now transpires there were as many as 20 instances where complaints were lodged about payment of excess compensation to some. UP Police had registered FIRs in 12 such cases.The SC bench said the SIT will probe ""whether the quantum of compensation paid was higher than the entitled amount and, if so, who the officers/officials responsible are,"" adding that the SIT was free to probe any allied issue that may arise during the inquiry.The SIT will investigate whether there was any connivance between landowners and Noida officials. It will also investigate whether overall functioning of Noida lacks transparency, fairness and objectivity,” the bench ordered, adding that the special probe team was free to probe any allied issues that may arise during the inquiry.The Justice Kant-led bench asked the SIT to submit its report in sealed cover within two months.The issue arose from the anticipatory bail petitions filed by a legal advisor and an assistant law officer of Noida, who were booked by UP Police four years ago for wrongdoings in payment of compensation for acquisition of land. The police had alleged that they had connived with landowners to release huge amounts of compensation, prima facie for extraneous considerations or on quid pro quo basis.","Supreme Court has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) comprising senior IPS officers.

"Tamil Nadu may be the birthplace of Iron Age, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-findings-in-state-push-iron-age-back-by-1000-years/articleshow/117496995.cms,"Turning point in Indian archaeology: ASI ex-DG

CHENNAI: Iron Age could well have begun in today's Tamil Nadu, at least 1,000 years before it was earlier estimated, recent dating of samples from burial urns at Sivagalai in Tuticorin district show.The two charcoal samples found along with iron objects at the site have been dated to 3,345 BCE and 3,259 BCE, which makes the Iron Age here the oldest in the world. Earlier, people of the Hittite Empire (in today's Turkiye) were believed to be the first to use iron, in 1,380 BCE. ""We have scientifically established that iron was introduced 5,300 years ago in the Tamil landscape. The Iron Age began from Tamil land,"" said chief minister M K Stalin, releasing the study ‘Antiquity of Iron: Recent Radiometric Dates from Tamil Nadu' by K Rajan and R Sivananthan on Thursday.Samples from Sivagalai were analysed by three leading research labs — Beta Analytics in US, Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in Lucknow. “They all dated the objects to around the same period,” Stalin said, asserting that more metallurgical analysis of the iron objects and future excavations in iron ore-bearing zones could further strengthen these findings.Scholars believe these dates suggest a contemporary Iron Age civilisation in southern India during the same period as Indus Valley civilisation in north and northwest India. “When cultural zones located north of Vindhyas experienced Copper Age, the region south of Vindhyas might have entered Iron Age due to limited availability of commercially exploitable copper ore,” the report said.Tamil Nadu archaeology department study has revealed that more than 90% of the ancient graffiti marks found at 140 archaeological sites in the state have parallels or similarities with those of Indus Valley (also known as Harappan civilisation) that existed from around 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE.“The recent radiocarbon dates indicate that when Indus Valley experienced Copper Age, south India was in Iron Age. In this sense, Iron Age of south India and Copper Age of the Indus were contemporary,” said archaeologist Rajan, the report’s co-author.ASI’s former director general Rakesh Tewari described the findings from Sivagalai as “a turning point” in Indian archaeology. “Once it appeared that when Indus Valley was flourishing in the western part of the country, other areas did not have contemporary cultures. But now things are changing,” he said. Before the latest findings, the earliest known iron objects in Tamil Nadu were dated to 2172 BCE from excavations at Mayiladumparai in Krishnagiri district.The samples from Sivagalai were analysed using advanced techniques such as accelerometer mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS14C) dating for charcoal and optically stimulated luminescence (OLS) dating for ceramics. A total of 11 dates were obtained from the site, with six dating earlier than 2400 BCE.More than 85 iron objects, including knives, arrowheads, rings, chisels, axes, and swords, were collected from various levels within and outside the urns.Another notable finding from the region was at Adichanallur, also in Thoothukudi district, where a charcoal sample linked with an iron object was dated to 2517 BCE.In comparison, sites like Brahmagiri in Karnataka and Gachibowli near Hyderabad have yielded Iron Age dating of 2140 BCE and 2200 BCE, respectively.“For the first time in the world, smelted iron has been dated back to the middle of the third millennium BCE. It is not just a significant discovery in the Indian context, but also in the context of archaeology of the world,” said Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, emeritus professor of South Asian Archaeology at Cambridge University, adding, “About 60 years ago, the antiquity of iron in India did not go beyond the 6th century BCE. From then to the 25th century BCE is a big jump.”"," charcoal samples found along with iron objects at the site have been dated to 3,345 BCE and 3,259 BCE.

While making bulk payments, the amount remained with the gateways for a day or two, during which ED had frozen around Rs 500 crore.The agency is investigating the money trail and also checking if the payment gateways had generated suspicious transaction reports (STR), and alerted the RBI and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). All financial institutions have to generate STRs and report them to the RBI periodically, which forwards them to the FIU for enforcement agencies to investigate further. Of the total Rs 497 crore frozen in the virtual accounts of payment gateways, PayU had highest at Rs 130 crore of the alleged 'proceeds of crime' related to the HPZ Token scam, followed by Rs 33.4 crore with Easebuzz, Rs 18 crore with Razorpay, Rs 10.6 crore with CashFree and Rs 2.8 crore with Paytm, a senior official said. The other payment gateways where ED has frozen the alleged scam money, include WunderBaked, AgreePay and SpeedPay.The accused ran a pan-India operation with companies incorporated in at least 20 states, where people were given the option to invest in the mining of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoins, through mobile app HPZ Token. More than 50 companies were registered in Delhi having 84 bank accounts, 26 firms in Karnataka with 37 bank accounts, 19 in Haryana and 11 in UP, besides Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.In this case, a PMLA court in Nagaland on Jan 22 declared a Delhi resident, Bhupesh Arora, as a fugitive economic offender as he refused to appear before the agency despite a non-bailable warrant against him. ED said Arora fled to Dubai in 2022 after it began investigations.

""Initial investigations have found that the deaths have not been caused due to infection, viral or bacterial. They have been caused by toxins. Tests are on to identify the type of toxin,"" Singh said. He added that suitable action will be taken if it is found that the toxicity was caused due to some mischief or malaise.Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of forensic medicine and toxicology at AIIMS said that toxins can be both natural and chemical. ""Detailed testing will be required to identify what type of toxin caused the deaths. It could be some insecticide, pesticide or even gases,"" he said.As many as 17 people, all of them belonging to three families residing in Badhal village in Rajouri district, have died since Dec 7. At least five others, including two children, are in critical condition after suffering from symptoms suggestive of neuro-toxicity or damage to the brain and the nervous system after exposure to certain toxins. ""The symptoms aren't suggestive of any infection. It looks like a case of poisoning, but we shouldn't conclude anything until the investigation is completed,"" one of the doctors at GMC, Jammu where three symptomatic individuals including two children are admitted, said.He said the affected children suffer from bouts of irritability, drowsiness, profuse sweating followed by respiratory distress. ""We have put one child on ventilator support. Her condition is critical. The other one is doing slightly better,"" the doctor, who did not want to be identified, said.Meanwhile, the residents of Badhal village in Rajouri district remain gripped by shock and fear.

He then used the staircase to reach the 10th floor, from where he climbed through the duct pipe to enter the bathroom in Khan's 11th floor flat. He used the same route to escape. He showed police that he used the same duct from fourth floor to scale down before he jumped 12ft after noticing that the ladder was missing.The probe team visited multiple locations with Shariful, including Bandra Talao, his Khar sleeping spot, Bandra station, Dadar and Worli-Koliwada, where they documented statements from the salon worker who cut his hair.

Poll What Do You Think About the Attack on the Indian Consulate in San Francisco? A Criminal Act That Should Be Addressed A Serious Matter That Needs Accountability

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishnakar on Thursday addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023, and called it a ""very serious matter"". He added that the country expected accountability from the US in the matter.""The arson attack on our consulate in San Francisco is a very, very serious matter, and it is something for which we expect accountability. We would like to see that people who did it are held responsible,"" Jaishankar said at a press conference in Washington DC.On March 19, 2023, the Consulate General of India in San Francisco faced a series of attacks. Early in the morning, assailants attempted to set the consulate building on fire by sprinkling inflammable substances.Later that day, a group of attackers engaged in criminal trespass, vandalized public property, and targeted consulate officials, escalating the severity of the incident.The video, which surfaced on social media, showed suspected pro-Khalistani protestors gathered outside the Indian Consulate, shouting slogans and heckling staff as they exited the diplomatic mission.Three months later, in July, Khalistan extremists made another attempt to set the Consulate on fire. Following this incident, an investigation was launched.The attack was condemned by the US as ""criminal offence"".Later that year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had assured the National Investigative agency that it was 'aggressively' looking into the attack."," External affairs minister S Jaishnakar on Thursday addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023.

Though the project's initial cost was estimated to be Rs 43,000 crore when the ""acceptance of necessity (AoN)"" was granted several years ago, it will be around Rs 70,000 crore now. ""It will be the task of the MoD's contract negotiation committee (CNC) to arrive at a reasonable cost,"" a source said.This comes after the ministry of defence's (MoD) technical oversight committee held the MDL-TKMS bid was ""compliant"" as per the technical parameters laid down in the tender, while the L&T-Navantia was ""non-compliant"" in the competition. The committee cleared the field evaluation trials conducted by the Navy last year, during which the German submarine demonstrated ""a fully-functional"" AIP system at sea. The Spanish submarine, however, could not exhibit a sea-proven AIP system.AIP gives a diesel-electric submarine the stealth capability to remain underwater for around two weeks, unlike a boat without it that has to surface or 'snorkel' every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge its batteries. It will, of course, take time for the actual P-75I contract to be inked, with the delivery of the first submarine slated for six-seven years after that, the sources said.MDL, of course, is also gearing up for construction of another three French-origin Scorpene submarines with AIP at a cost of around Rs 38,000 crore. The PM-led cabinet committee on security is set to clear the deal before this fiscal ends on March 31, as earlier reported by TOI.These three new boats will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL, without AIP, under the over Rs 23,000 crore 'Project-75'.Both P-75 (additional Scorpenes) and P-75I are crucial for the Navy because it is left with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet, apart from the six new Scorpenes.",Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) in partnership with German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) The defence ministry will now begin techno-commercial negotiations with MDL for'Project-75 India'to build the six stealth conventional submarines.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117499787,imgsize-53150,width-400,resizemode-4/117499787.jpg"

Shivakumar had recently said he would ""perform his duty""; any decision on leadership rests with the party.Siddaramaiah’s statement Thursday stems from a 50-50 power-sharing formula that was widely talked about soon after Congress scored a big win in 2023 assembly polls. At that time, Shivakumar had pushed for the chief minister’s post, prompting the party to intervene and reportedly propose a 30-month power-sharing arrangement.Siddaramaiah is set to complete 30 months in office by year-end. Supporters of two front-runners — Shivakumar and public works minister Satish Jarkiholi — have been organising special rituals in temples to pray for their respective candidates to secure the chief ministership.About the feud between the camps, Siddaramaiah said, “Ultimately high command will take a call.” He also addressed BJP’s allegations of misuse of funds allocated for SC/ST welfare programmes.BJP state president BY Vijayendra had accused Congress govt of misappropriating funds and failing to address concerns of these communities. The CM dismissed the charges as “politically motivated”.","Siddaramaiah indicated for the first time an arrangement between him and his deputy, DK Shivakumar, to take turns as CM.

What is condition of schools in UP, asks Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath , during a BJP rally in Delhi on Thursday, took repeated jabs at AAP and its chief, Arvind Kejriwal , accusing the party of hindering Delhi's development over the past decade.Yogi also emphasised the need for the BJP’s ""double-engine"" government to be implemented in the capital.The UP CM alleged that AAP and its ministers are facilitating the settlement of illegal Bangladeshis and Rohingyas in the Okhla area of Delhi. He blamed Kejriwal for allegedly turning the holy Yamuna river into a ""dirty drain"" and calling it a ""sin"".""Yesterday, I along with all my ministers took a holy dip at the Sangam in Prayagraj where Maha Kumbh is on. I want to ask Kejriwal whether he can bathe in the Yamuna in Delhi along with his ministers. He should answer if he has any moral courage,"" Yogi said.Yogi claimed that the AAP government has turned Delhi into a “garbage dump” and neglected essential services like clean water, electricity, and promised subsidies that were never delivered to the people. He also criticised AAP for the poor state of roads, sanitation, drinking water issues, and sewer overflows in the national capital.Yogi further drew comparisons between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, claiming that the roads in Noida and Ghaziabad in UP are far better than those in the national capital. He also highlighted the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, praising its scale and significance.Yogi Adityanath's speech marked his first rally in the Kirari area ahead of the February 5 Delhi Assembly polls, with the results set to be announced on February 8.Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal took a shot at the UP CM, asking about the condition of government schools in UP and criticizing Yogi Adityanath. ""His [Yogi] government has been in power for more than 10 years, he has not been able to fix the government schools.""The AAP convener further claimed that AAP could teach UP ""how to fix government schools."" These jibes were made as Yogi was rallying in Delhi ahead of the Assembly elections.""Yogi Adityanath ji has come to Delhi, I want to ask him that the condition of government schools in UP is so bad, his government has been in power for more than 10 years, he has not been able to fix the government schools.

The state home department has set up a special investigation team to investigate the allegations. The report is expected after six months.A senior official of the Nashik administration said the state govt's communication to divisional commissioners and district collectors cites several complaints about laws being bypassed to approve delayed applications for birth and death certificates.Until 2023, applications delayed by a year and more required judicial approval. The central govt then amended the law, granting authority to district collectors and sub-divisional officers to approve such applications.The change led to alleged misuse of the system in districts like Malegaon and Amravati, where reports suggest that thousands of fake birth certificates have been issued to Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants. Data from all districts is being collated as part of the probe, officials said.Malegaon's AIMIM MLA Mohammed Khaliq accused BJP's Somaiya of defaming his constituency since the saffron party lost the Lok Sabha election there. ""What were the central and state home ministries, both managed by BJP, doing when these people entered India and the state?"" he said.In Pune district, 2,470 delayed birth certificates and 1,488 delayed death certificates have been kept on hold and are being scrutinised, district administration officials said.

Both were produced in a court from where they were sent to jail Wednesday.Officials confirmed that the contraband was intended for distribution outside Rajasthan. DRI officials noted similar incidents at other Indian airports recently. ""It appears that following strictness at other airports, the smugglers were trying to use Jaipur airport as a safe route,"" the official added.Regarding the seized substance, an official explained, ""Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in hydroponic weed is 30% to 40% as compared to 3% to 4% in the regular 'ganja' available in India. Prices of hydroponic weed are much higher.""Senior officers have not ruled out the possibility of more seizures and arrests. ""We can't share further details. Our teams are working on other available inputs,"" the officer added.",The smuggling ring chose Jaipur airport as their point of entry apparently due to increased security measures at other airports in the country. DRI officials said that the narcotics syndicate for the first time made the carrier and the receiver of the haul travel together on the same flight.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117498578,imgsize-1110630,width-400,resizemode-4/117498578.jpg"
‘Saif’s critical med details not in 1st hosp report so no murder bid in FIR’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saifs-critical-med-details-not-in-1st-hosp-report-so-no-murder-bid-in-fir/articleshow/117497706.cms,"Mumbai: The assault charges filed by Bandra police on Shariful Fakir , actor Saif Ali Khan 's attacker, has triggered another round of debate.In the wee hours of Jan 16, Shariful broke into Khan's Bandra home and repeatedly stabbed him — leaving behind a 2.5-inch knife tip in a wound near his mid spine that oozed spinal fluid.While legal experts said that an attempt to murder charge could have been added given the extent of the back wound, police said their charges reflected the medico-legal case report filed by Lilavati Hospital doctors soon after Khan entered the casualty in his bloodied clothes.The hospital report filed at 4.11am — almost an hour after the actor's arrival — states multiple lacerations and abrasions and has no mention of the deep wound in his mid-spine region that necessitated an emergency operation.A senior police officer said, ""The severity of injuries alone doesn't justify an attempt-to-murder charge. The intent is paramount.""The FIR, based on the initial scene examination and Lilavati Hospital's medico-legal case, has been filed for attempted robbery. Bandra police later added charges of grievous injury, armed robbery attempt and house trespassing after further investigation. As Shariful is a Bangladeshi national staying here illegally, police have since added provisions under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners Order, 1948.A senior police officer said the omission of critical medical details has complicated the case. ""The injuries mentioned in the report were deemed insufficient to invoke Section 109 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with attempted murder,"" he said. To apply this stringent charge, police must assess the offender's intent, the nature of injuries and the criminal history.In public hospitals, where medico-legal case reports are regularly filed, the initial report is almost always followed by a detailed report by surgeon or treating doctor. ""However, we send the surgeon's report only after police seek an updated report,"" a doctor said, adding that police more often than not ask for such a follow-up report within 24 hours of the patient's admission. The initial report is filled in the casualty, and mostly includes observations. ""Reports of detailed scans or blood reports are not available at this time,"" said the doctor.It is learnt that police are awaiting further evidence and analysis before adding Section 109 (attempt to murder), if at all. If invoked, the section carries a maximum punishment of 10 years' jail.Meanwhile, Khan is recovering under medical care, and his legal team is reportedly preparing to pursue stricter charges against the accused.",Shariful Fakir broke into Saif Ali Khan's Bandra home and repeatedly stabbed him.

The actor said, ""My grip loosened after the stranger stabbed me repeatedly on my back with a knife after I overpowered him."" Saif said his family members and staff were frightened upon encountering the armed assailant. He rushed towards the intruder to protect his son and the staff. According to his statement, Saif and his wife Kareena were in their bedroom, while his son Taimur was in another room with a nurse. His younger son Jehangir was in a separate bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip noticed the intruder.A police officer said: ""Saif said he and Kareena came out of the bedroom on hearing Phillip's scream and Jehangir crying. He saw a stranger attacking Phillip. So he charged at him and grabbed him. The stranger stabbed him to escape."" Following his return from hospital, Saif learnt from Phillip that the intruder had demanded Rs 1 crore. Police said after the attack, Saif's sons Ibrahim and Taimur took him to hospital in an auto.On Wednesday, police completed the crime scene reconstruction with the recovery of the white bag near Bandra Talao. ""The bag contained various tools including a screwdriver, hammer, hacksaw blade, and a broken knife piece, which the accused had discarded near Bandra Talao, around 1.4km away from Satguru Sharan building on St Teresa Road,"" said an officer. During the re-enactment, Shariful demonstrated to the police team his entry method: scaling a 4-ft wall to enter Satguru Sharan premises, using a ladder to climb 12ft to access the duct, reaching the fourth floor where he cut the rat mesh with a knife. He then used the staircase to reach the 10th floor, from where he climbed through the duct pipe to enter the bathroom in Khan's 11th floor flat. He used the same route to escape.The team visited multiple locations with Shariful, including Bandra Talao, Bandra station, Dadar and Worli-Koliwada, where they documented statements from the salon worker who cut his hair. ""Police analysed footage from over 650 CCTV cameras, both private and govt-owned...,around three dozen recordings show his presence in the area and his movements, which serve as evidence,"" said police.Shariful, who is an illegal Bangladeshi migrant, told police that his intention was to only commit burglary and not harm the actor. He requested the police to deport him to his home country.Shariful will be produced before Bandra court on Friday.","Shariful Fakir, 30, arrested for breaking into Saif Ali Khan's Bandra residence and stabbing him on Jan 16.

Similar accident claimed 22 lives in Mumbai 31 years ago

NAHSIK: It was smoke that perhaps sparked rumours of a fire, which caused panicked passengers to jump out of Pushpak Express, only to be crushed under the wheels of the oncoming Karnataka Express on the adjoining track, said survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy that took place near Pachora station in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district.The unreserved coaches of the train were packed to the hilt, and chaos ensued as soon as the train stopped. Jagmohan Paswan, a 48-year-old survivor, said: “There were many vendors in our coach. One of them shouted that a fire had broken out in a coach. Seconds later, the train stopped and everyone came rushing to squeeze out of the two doors. My relative, Uttam Paswan, too, jumped out and sustained head & leg injuries.”Paswan said those killed and injured had jumped out of the door on the right side of the coach. Uttam was among them, but survived, he said, adding those who exited from the left door, including himself, were unharmed.Sanjeev Singh, who was on his way to Shirdi, said: “We were sitting when suddenly people started screaming about a fire. There was some smoke emanating, but not from a fire. However, this caused chaos, and a few seconds later, the train pulled to a stop. I went to the door and saw people jumping out and coming under the train on the next track. I saw eight to ten bodies on the other track.”“Our coach was intact and people in AC coaches were mostly safe. I am not sure if the smoke was from pantry or braking,” he said.Md Mulin (42), whose relative Md Bilal sustained injuries in the right leg, said there was hardly any space in the coach they were travelling in. “Even the doors were blocked by passengers standing there. Suddenly, everyone rushed towards the doors.” Recounting the heart-rending sight before him on jumping out, he said: “I saw dismembered bodies on the adjacent track. I will not forget what I witnessed.”According to some survivors, the loco pilot of Karnataka Express stopped the train after seeing passengers from Pushpak Express jumping out. Had it not stopped, the toll would have been higher, they said. Residents of Pachora town and villages near the accident site reached the spot to help.The Jalgaon tragedy revives the painful memory of a similar accident in which 21 women and a boy lost their lives in Mumbai’s Goregaon. Tragedy struck at 7.14 pm on Oct 13, 1993, when passengers on Western Railway’s ‘ladies special’ local between Borivli and Kandivli jumped off a first class compartment on to the tracks after seeing smoke rise from the undercarriage of their stationary train, unaware that the Borivli-Churchgate local was hurtling towards them.Heavy showers, accompanied by thunder and lightning, added to the panic and chaos, and they were run over. Apower cut hampered rescue operations. The fire alarm was later found to be false.","Survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

Assam govt gets 6 weeks to file compliance affidavit

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres and not being deported to their country and asked the chief secretary to appear before it through virtual mode on the next date of hearing with an explanation.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N Kotiswar Singh said the fundamental right to life was not confined only to citizens but all people, including foreigners, and immediate steps should be taken to deport them to their country.The bench was hearing a case pertaining to 270 people in detention centres/transit camps in Assam. ""Time of six weeks was granted to the state to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in the transit camps and details of the steps taken by the state govt for deporting the detenus,"" the bench said.Time of six weeks was granted to the state govt to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in transit camps and details of steps taken by state govt for deporting the detenus.We find from the annexure to the affidavit that some of the foreigners are languishing in the camps for about 10 years and more. The affidavit does not give any justification for detaining 270 persons and, moreover, steps taken to deport them are not set out. This is a gross violation of orders of this court. We direct the chief secretary of Assam to remain present through VC and explain the non-compliance,” the top court said.The lawyer appearing for Assam told the bench the deportation process of illegal migrants took place through the Union govt. He said complete details of illegal migrants, including contact address, were to be provided by the state govt to the ministry of external affairs, which then verifies the identities of the migrants through diplomatic channels.Earlier, SC had directed Assam State Legal Services Authority to conduct visits at the Matia transit camp for foreigners to check the facility’s hygiene and food quality.",Supreme Court pulls up Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres.

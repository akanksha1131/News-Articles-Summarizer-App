NEW DELHI: Born in a scheduled caste family in Peermade village in Idukki district of Kerala, C T Ravikumar decided to study law after graduating in zoology leading to a four-decade long career and his becoming a judge of the highest court through sheer hard work, proficiency and ability to win hearts both in the courts and outside.Justice Ravikumar retires on Jan 5. He sat on a ceremonial farewell bench with CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar on Friday. Attorney general R Venkataramani recited a poem composed in his honour – “Soft in demeanour, sure in speech; Frail in walk, firm in views; Acumen sharp, attentions deep: Gentle looks but questioning eyes; … Mind so open, thoughts all clear: Hiding no riders, equal treatment with lines none drawn.”CJI Khanna said the poem captured Justice Ravikumar’s personality so completely. “He belongs to God's own country and is loved by all, bar and bench. He is a noble soul who has won over hearts with his humane qualities. His love for cricket and nature is well known. He comes from a rural background unlike many of us hailing from the cities and towns having access to better facilities. His reaching the highest court as a judge is an achievement in itself,” the CJI said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Ravikumar is simplicity personified and never carried the stature of a Judge. SCBA president Kapil Sibal said though the judge was an ardent cricket lover, he never bowled a googly to the lawyers. SCoARA president Vipin Nair, referring to his love for cricket, said his first innings had been spectacular and wished him a fulfilling second innings.Justice Ravikumar said, “Even after getting appointed as a judge of the HC and then as a Judge of the SC, one thing that never left me is the feeling of being a lawyer. That’s where I belong and that’s why I respect all lawyers.”“Traditionally, the Indians bat well in the second innings, I wish I will bat well in my second innings (after retirement career),” he said. He started practicing in 1986 in the district courts at Mavelikara. He shifted practice to Kerala HC in 1996 and was appointed a judge of the HC on Jan 5, 2009. He took oath as a judge of the SC on Aug 31, 2021 and had a tenure of little over three years and four months as a SC judge.",C T Ravikumar decided to study law after graduating in zoology leading to a four-decade long career.

As the new year dawns, hope and positivity bloom. The ancient Romans named the first month 'January' after Janus, the enigmatic deity of beginnings, transitions, duality and doorways.My relationship with January has metamorphosed through life's seasons. In childhood, it meant returning to school after half-yearly examinations and the anticipation of annual day celebrations, while in college years, it was about the enchanting Mardi Gras at IIT Madras. January became a symbol of romance when my husband chose this month to propose; it was also the month I became pregnant. In professional life, it meant bonuses and promotions while now, January serves as a gentle reminder to infuse the coming year with purpose, health and joy.Each year, as I retire the old calendar and welcome its successor, emotions ripple through me. Time's passage prompts soul-searching: What treasures did I gather, what burdens did I shed? Did my spiritual baggage grow heavier, and did I learn the art of letting go? Can I embrace my past with serenity while greeting the future with hope?Janus' dual visage offers profound wisdom — one face contemplating the past, the other gazing into the future. His twin aspects speak to something deeper: the ability to hold opposing perspectives in balance, to seek reconciliation between conflicting viewpoints.As Jean-Paul Sartre observed, ""There is no black and white, only a strong grey."" Truth dwells not in absolutes but in nuances, not in judgments but in understanding, not in success or failure but in persistence.This idea echoes in the opening of the Mahabharata — Prince Janamejayan's vengeful sacrifice. Grieving his father's death by snakebite, he initiated the Sarpa Satra, a ritual to destroy all serpents.One by one, the serpents perished in the sacrificial flames until the moment Takshaka, along with his serpent wife, were about to meet their end. Young sage Astika suddenly stepped forward and halted the sacrifice by requesting the life of Takshaka as his reward, a right that could not be denied to a sage during a yagna. Born to a Brahmin father and serpent mother, Astika embodied the union of opposites.When Janamejayan protested, the great sage Vyasa, his own great-grandfather, said, ""Child,"" he said, ""in seeking to destroy all darkness, you risk creating an imbalance far more dangerous than the evil you wish to eliminate. Just as night follows day in the eternal cycle, so must light and shadow coexist in nature and in human hearts.""Vyasa commanded Vaishampayana to narrate his work 'Jaya', where the mighty Arjuna, ancestor to Janamejayan, navigated the complex waters between dharma and adharma, right and wrong, justice and mercy, light and darkness.This eternal truth finds voice in Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar's immortal words. When you judge or assess a person — whether a life partner, friend, foe or a colleague — do not see only what you want to see. Assess the brighter side and the darker side, check which one over-shadows the other and accept both and see the positive aspects first.Embrace life's inherent duality; perfection lies not in purity but in balance.As we step through January's door, may we carry this wisdom forward, understanding that life's richness dwells not in extremes but in the delicate dance between past and future, acceptance and growth.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116919299,imgsize-60046,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116919299.jpg"
"Running all-year round, this school in rural Maha creating ripples with 12-hour classes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/running-all-year-round-this-school-in-rural-maha-creating-ripples-with-12-hour-classes/articleshow/116929302.cms,"PUNE: Twelve-hour classes all-year round, creative writing skills that outshine those of peers, and multiplication tables memorised up to 1,000. A school in a Nashik backwater is creating ripples with all that and more, drawing Maharashtra education minister Dada Bhuse to the remote tribal hamlet within weeks of taking charge.The whiz-kids at the zilla parishad school at Hiwali village in Trimbakeshwar taluka are no bookworms, though. They blend classroom lessons with practical skills such as welding, electrical work and organic farming, reflecting a holistic approach to education.Most of those achievements have come through the innovative efforts of Keshav Gavit . ""This extraordinary commitment to learning not only fostered a deep love for schooling among the children but also cultivated remarkable academic abilities in them,"" Gavit said.Interacting with students when he visited Hiwali for a first-hand tour of the school last week, Bhuse was amazed by their enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge, and awestruck by the dexterity of some who could write with both hands. It was a testament to the power of perseverance and transformative impact of quality education. ""The emphasis on speaking English, general knowledge, and arts, along with cultivation of organic vegetables by students, showcases an inclusive and expansive education model,"" he said.Hiwali's educational transformation began in 2009 when the village, with limited access to basic amenities, had just nine students. The challenges were daunting as a significant portion of the village's population had minimal exposure to education. Through persistent efforts, home visits, and a focus on improving basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills, a foundation was laid for a better future. ""By 2014, the school began to flourish,"" Gavit said. He said Bhuse spoke about presenting the school as a blueprint for educational excellence in the state.","Hiwali's educational transformation began in 2009 when the village, with limited access to basic amenities, had just nine students.

"Under new policy, Lieutenant Generals to be promoted on merit basis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-new-policy-lieutenant-generals-to-be-promoted-on-merit-basis/articleshow/116929166.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India moving towards the creation of tri-Service theatre commands, the Army has adopted a radical change in the promotion policy for top officers by making it necessary for all Lieutenant Generals to be graded on their performance through a “quantified assessment system”.This new system, which will come into force from March 31, will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex-level appointments in the integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments, sources told TOI.The new policy for Lt-Gens, with “revised annual confidential report (ACR) forms”, will not apply to the vice chief and commanders-in-chief of the six operational commands and one training command in the Army. These eight officers are also Lt-Gens but a rung higher than the other three-star generals.The over 11-lakh Army has almost 90 Lt-Gens, 300 Major Generals and 1,200 Brigadiers in its 43,000-strong officer cadre. “The new policy for Lt-Gens will align the Army with the much smaller IAF and Navy, where the quantified appraisal of equivalent ranks (Air Marshals and Vice Admirals) is already there,” a source said.“There was no quantified ACR system for Lt-Gens so far. Now, they will be graded on different attributes on a scale from 1 to 9. In effect, promotions will be based on merit rather than just seniority. The impending creation of theatre commands requires a uniform assessment system for the top ranks in all the three Services,” he added.The Army headquarters’ letter on the new policy does not specify whether it will also be applicable for the selection of the vice-chief and seven commanders-in-chief within the force.As per the existing Army policy, promotion to the C-in-C level is based purely on seniority, in conjunction with the date of birth and vacancies available. A Lt-Gen, after he has commanded one of the 14 corps in the force, must have `residual’ service of 18 months (till he turns 60) to be promoted as the C-in-C of one of the seven Army commands.Strong reservations against the new policy are already being expressed by some officers. “Very few officers become three-star generals after being assessed on merit at every step in their careers in the Army’s steeply-pyramidical structure,” a senior officer said.“After the Lt-Gen rank, promotion to C-in-C was based on seniority. Introducing merit at this stage will open the door for interference, political or otherwise,” he added.The policy comes at a time when the blueprint for the three theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region has been finalized to ensure an integrated war-fighting machinery. Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan has already made presentations to defence minister Rajnath Singh and national security advisor Ajit Doval on the matter.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram, as earlier reported by TOI.",New system will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex- level appointments in integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments.

'AAPda': PM Modi slams AAP as corrupt and disaster for Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aapda-pm-modi-slams-aap-as-corrupt-and-disaster-for-delhi/articleshow/116928992.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Modi launched a scathing attack on AAP on Friday, calling it ""AAPda"" (Hindi for disaster), virtually setting the tone for an aggressive and high-pitched campaign for the assembly elections to be held in the capital in February.Speaking at an event in Ashok Vihar while inaugurating various development initiatives, the PM gave the slogan, ""AAPda ko nahi sahenge, badal ke rahenge (We will not tolerate the disaster, will change things)."" He repeated the slogan several times with the crowd joining him amidst loud cheers. Accusing AAP of putting brakes on Delhi's development, the PM said voters have now decided to get rid of the party.""This is the country's capital and it is the right of people to get good governance. But in the past 10 years, Delhi has been in the grip of a big AAPda,"" he said.""By putting Anna Hazareji at the forefront, some kattar beimaan people pushed Delhi into aapda,"" he added.This was an indirect jibe at AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who has in the past called himself ""kattar imaandar (hardcore honest)"". AAP functionaries, including Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, are facing corruption charges in the excise policy case.Modi accused AAP of engaging in corruption in liquor policy, schools, treatment of the poor, fight against pollution and jobs. ""These people talked about Delhi's development but have now become an 'aapda' on Delhi,"" he said. He accused them of engaging in open corruption and then glorifying it.This was Modi's first political speech ahead of the state polls when, again without taking names, he targeted Kejriwal over renovation of the CM's residence on 6 Flag Staff Road in Civil Lines. He said he could have also built a ""sheesh mahal"" for himself, but his dream was to ensure homes for everyone in the country.""The country knows very well that Modi never built a house for himself, but in the past 10 years, I fulfilled the dreams of over four crore poor families by providing them with homes,"" he said.Taking a swipe at the AAP govt, the PM said in areas where it can't intervene, work gets done. ""In DDA, there is not much intervention of AAPda, so it is able to give so many houses to the poor and middle class, supplying gas through pipelines,"" he said. He said construction of highways and expressways in Delhi is progressing because there is no involvement of AAP govt in these projects.He also targeted AAP over non-implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi. Modi said that because of the city govt not allowing the Centre's signature health insurance scheme and other programmes to be implemented in the capital, he was unable to fully help the people living here despite efforts.In an attempt to counter AAP's free electricity scheme, the PM said the central govt is making electricity bill zero with Pradhan Mantri Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojna. Under this scheme, people are even earning. ""The BJP govt is giving Rs 78,000 to a family to install solar panels,"" he said.PM Narendra Modi said the central govt is providing free ration to nearly 75 lakh needy people in Delhi.","PM Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on AAP on Friday, calling it ""AAPda"" (Hindi for disaster) Accusing AAP of putting brakes on Delhi's development, the PM said voters have now decided to get rid of the party.

Virat Kohli - out or not out at SCG?

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai 26/11 attack accused Tahawwur Rana is making his final legal attempt to avoid extradition to India . His lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, has appealed to the US Supreme Court , challenging the lower court's ruling, arguing that extradition would violate the double jeopardy principle , which protects against being tried twice for the same crime.Rana's lawyer stated that the court should prevent the extradition based on how ""offence"" is defined in the US-India extradition treaty. Dratel argued, ""The (Supreme) Court should grant the writ. On the merits, it should hold that the term ""offence"" in the double jeopardy provision of the United States-India extradition treaty (and many other similar treaties) refers to the conduct underlying the charges in the two countries, rather than the elements of the crimes the respective countries have charged.""The US top court will confer on this matter on January 17.Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian citizen and currently in Los Angeles, was found to be connected to David Headley , a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was previously tried in Chicago for his links to the attacks which resulted in 166 deaths, including six Americans. Rana’s legal team contends the charges in India stem from the same actions already addressed in the Chicago trial.However, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar disagrees. She told the Supreme Court, ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case."" She pointed to India’s forgery accusations against Rana, relating to a fraudulent application he submitted to the Reserve Bank of India, as an example of conduct not addressed in the US prosecution.This comes as the US government in December supported India's request to extradite Rana. The US Solicitor General Prelogar had called upon the US Supreme Court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Read full story: US government asks Supreme Court to dismiss Tahawwur Rana's plea Prior to this, Rana had appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful.

Whilst the treaty permits refusal of extradition for ""offence of a political character"", it explicitly states that certain crimes, including homicide, cannot be classified as political.

We aim to strengthen economic and trade cooperation,"" he said, adding that he was invited by Bangladesh's chief adviser Muhamad Yunus during a meeting in Cairo recently.""When we assumed office, there was a perception of diplomatic isolation. However, by expanding our diplomatic reach and engaging with regional neighbours, this perception has changed,"" Dar stated.Dar also emphasised on Pakistan’s desire to strengthen ties with Kabul but acknowledged that terrorism remains a significant challenge. He criticised former intelligence chief Gen Faiz Hameed for engaging in talks with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and noted that recent visits to Kabul were postponed due to ongoing terrorist attacks.Pakistan has experienced a surge in terrorist activities since the Afghan Taliban came to power in 2021 and has urged Kabul to prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to target Pakistan.Dar also announced progress in Pakistan’s nuclear energy sector, unveiling the Chashma 5 (C-5) nuclear power project.

Nationally, the coastline increase compared to 1970 data stands at 47.6%. This major upward revision of coastline length across nine states and UTs is attributed primarily to using a new methodology to measure India's maritime parameter, as established by the National Maritime Security Coordinator.Unlike older methods that relied on straight-line distance measurements, the scientifically updated approach incorporates the measurement of complex coastal formations such as bays, estuaries, inlets, and other geomorphological features.According to experts, this refined methodology provides a more precise representation of the true length of the coastline, capturing its dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics. Coastline data from 1970, as reported by the National Hydrographic Office and Survey of India, was based on the measurement techniques and technologies available at the time.While Gujarat retains its position as the state with the longest coastline, Tamil Nadu, with a revised length of 1,068km (previously 906km), has overtaken Andhra Pradesh (1,053km), based on the new survey.Puducherry's coastline - including Karaikal, Yanam, and Mahe - contracted by 4.9km, marking a departure from the upward revision elsewhere.Kerala reported the smallest increase, adding 30km (5%) to its coastline. The data cited in the MHA report are still under review.

The states/UTs of Chandigarh, Kerala, and Delhi have the best coverage with over half of the population having to travel less than one hour, while states/UTs like Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, and north-eastern states have the least coverage,” she said and stressed on the need to bridge this gap.Dr Kameshwar Prasad, a top neurologist and former director of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, said delaying arrival of stroke patients certainly impacts the treatment outcome and having more stroke-ready centers was the need of hour.In addition to that, Dr Prasad said, a drive was needed to create awareness on how to recognise stroke symptoms, both among the public and the first-contact doctors. “I made RIMS stroke-ready, but it took one year to get a patient eligible for clot-dissolving medicine and use the same. Though in the city itself, in one year approx. 200 patients would have suffered ischemic (blockage type) of stroke. What it means is that providing stroke ready hospitals even in proximity would not result in eligible stroke patients receiving thrombolysis or thrombectomy, unless public and primary contact professionals are educated about stroke,” he added.","India sees nearly 1.5 million stroke cases every year of which nearly 85 to 90 per cent are caused by a clot in the major blood vessels of the brain.

Gift deed can be quashed if kids neglect parents: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gift-deed-can-be-quashed-if-kids-neglect-parents-sc/articleshow/116926192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emphasising need to protect interests of senior citizens, many of whom are ignored by their children and left to fend for themselves once they hand over property by executing a gift deed , Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act if the children fail to take care of them. The transfer of property would be declared null and void, court said.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Karol said the Act is a beneficial legislation meant to lend a helping hand to elders who are left alone due to withering of joint family system and that its provisions should be interpreted liberally, and not in the strict sense, to protect their rights.It set aside a Madhya Pradesh HC verdict which held that gift deeds cannot be quashed on grounds of not serving parents if such conditions were not expressly mentioned in the deed. SC said HC took a 'strict view' of the legislation when a liberal view was needed to be taken to fulfil purpose of the law.Section 23 of the Act says, ""Where any senior citizen who, after the commencement of this Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the transferee shall provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor and if such transferee refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, the said transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor be declared void by the tribunal.""Referring to this, HC had held that a gift deed should have a clause to the effect to bind children to take care of parents, and the deed cannot be quashed in absence of it. But SC overruled the verdict.The court allowed a woman's plea for quashing the gift deed in favour of her son who refused to take care of her. It relied on ""avachan patra/promissory note"" executed by her son promising to take care of her till the end of her life and that if he does not do so, she will be at liberty to take back the deed. The note was executed on the same day of execution of the gift deed.""The Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, aimed at securing rights of senior citizens, in view of the challenges faced by them. It is in this backdrop that the Act must be interpreted and a construction that advances remedies of the Act must be adopted,"" SC said.","Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act.

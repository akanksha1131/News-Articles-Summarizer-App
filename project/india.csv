NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with students from across the country during a special episode of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, offering guidance on exams, personal growth, discipline, leadership, technology use, and nation-building ahead of the board examination season.During his interaction with students from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, PM Modi expressed happiness over their aspirations, saying, ""I felt good to see that the students of Classes 10 and 12 in my country also carry the dream of Viksit Bharat 2047 in their minds. This is a matter of great happiness for me.""He emphasised the importance of disciplined habits, adding, ""We should adopt the habits of developed countries—we should turn off engines at red lights, we should not leave the food, and we should reduce wastage... Discipline is very important in our life...""On the use of technology, the prime minister advised students not to let smartphones or AI dominate their lives. He said, ""We should try not to make AI or mobile the master; some kids do not eat food unless they see the smartphone. We can use AI efficiently.""He also reflected on his long association with students, adding, ""I have been interacting with students of Classes 10 and 12 for many years through Pariksha Pe Charcha.I engage in these conversations to learn, not to teach.""In a separate session with students from Raipur, Chhattisgarh, PM Modi shared traditional local snacks, Thethri and Khurmi. When asked to suggest five travel destinations for students, he advised them to first make a list of places near their district, city, and state, and then decide.PM Modi also encouraged students to support classmates who are weaker in studies. ""Students should befriend them and explain topics to them, adding that teaching others helps one learn better as well,"" he said. He stressed the importance of balancing sports with studies, reminding students of the mantra, ""Khelogey to khilogey.""""To become a leader, develop a mindset to take initiative... A leader does not only mean contesting elections, but a good leader should communicate ideas clearly and effectively,"" said PM Modi.PM Modi also interacted with students last week, providing guidance on exams, personal growth, skills, technology use, and nation-building ahead of the board examination season. During the session, he held wide-ranging discussions with students, covering topics such as exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness, and pursuing dreams. Students also showcased their creativity by performing self-composed songs for him.The 2026 edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha aims to help students stay stress-free during exams while promoting a stronger focus on learning, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.","PM Narendra Modi interacted with students from across the country during a special episode of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026.

"Instead of foreign data, ICMR wants India’s own evidence to treat lifestyle diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/instead-of-foreign-data-icmr-wants-indias-own-evidence-to-treat-lifestyle-diseases/articleshow/128098205.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a shift aimed at making medical treatment more relevant to Indian patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases, instead of relying largely on data from Western countries.The move targets conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other non-communicable diseases that affect millions across the country. Health experts say therapies proven effective in Western populations do not always produce the same results in Indian patients because of differences in genetics, diet, climate, disease patterns and access to care.The need for such an approach is already evident in ongoing research. Dr Ambuj Rao, cardiologist at AIIMS Delhi, said India-specific clinical research is essential, pointing to a pan-India influenza vaccine trial in heart attack patients currently underway at AIIMS. He noted that evidence for such interventions cannot come from Western countries because India has a distinct flu season and different public health challenges.Under the initiative, networks of at least five hospitals will jointly evaluate treatments, medical procedures, digital tools and lifestyle interventions in real-world Indian settings.The aim is to identify therapies that are not only clinically effective but also affordable and workable within government hospitals and public health programmes. Officials said the findings will directly inform national treatment guidelines, with each selected study eligible for funding of up to Rs 8 crore over four years.Dr Ravinder Goswami from the endocrinology department at AIIMS Delhi said India’s tropical climate, repeated cycles of stress and poverty, and distinct dietary patterns have led to unique metabolic and hormonal adaptations in Indians, including insulin resistance, higher cortisol levels, central obesity and lower muscle mass. He said rapid lifestyle changes and the growing consumption of refined foods have worsened the burden of diabetes, hypertension, polycystic disorders and other metabolic diseases, which require culturally acceptable and India-specific treatment strategies. The ICMR’s call for well-planned studies, he added, offers a crucial opportunity to generate evidence for conditions unique to India, including certain metabolic disorders and cancers such as oral cancer.Beyond improving treatment protocols, the programme is also expected to strengthen India’s research capacity. Participating hospitals will be required to conduct trials independently, maintain standardised digital records and share data transparently, reducing dependence on pharmaceutical-driven global research.Public health experts say the initiative could have a direct impact on patients, as even small changes in treatment protocols, backed by Indian evidence, can improve outcomes and reduce out-of-pocket spending for families living with chronic disease. If successful, the effort could ensure that what doctors prescribe in India is guided by data generated from Indian patients, not assumptions imported from elsewhere.","The Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases.

The cancer we can see and still miss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-cancer-we-can-see-and-still-miss/articleshow/128098056.cms,".

It begins in plain sight — on the tongue, the cheek, the gums. Yet oral cancer, one of the few cancers that can be detected by a simple examination of the mouth, continues to be diagnosed far too late in India.Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply. While early-stage oral cancer has a five-year survival rate of over 80 per cent, late-stage disease pushes survival below 30 per cent. India today accounts for almost one-third of the world’s oral cancer burden, turning a largely preventable disease into a silent public health crisis.Doctors say the problem is delay. Patients typically take three to seven months from first noticing symptoms to reaching a specialised cancer centre. Early lesions are often painless, small, and easily ignored. A minor ulcer, a white patch, or slight discomfort while chewing is dismissed, especially among tobacco users, until the disease progresses beyond easy cure.“Oral cancer outcomes change dramatically with early screening,” says Dr Sultan A Pradhan, Surgical Oncologist at the Head &Neck Cancer Institute of India.Organised screening programmes, he says, can reduce mortality by 24 to 30 percent by detecting precancerous lesions early. Mobile screening units and community cancer camps have already shown that timely identification can stop cancer before it turns fatal.The risk factors are well known. More than 90 percent of oral cancer cases in India are linked to tobacco use, particularly smokeless forms such as gutka, khaini, and betel nut. Alcohol further increases the risk. Doctors are also reporting a gradual rise in HPV-related oral cancers among younger patients with no history of tobacco use, expanding the risk beyond traditional groups.Specialised hospitals play a crucial role once patients enter the system, combining early detection pathways with advanced surgery, reconstruction, and team-based care. But clinicians emphasise that even the best technology cannot fully offset the damage caused by late diagnosis. Oral cancer remains one of the few cancers where awareness and timely referral save more lives than any single drug or machine.At the same time, cancer care is moving beyond what scans can show. Dr Shrinidhi Nathany, Consultant Molecular Hematologist and Oncologist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, explains that tumours smaller than five millimetres often escape detection on CT or PET scans. Blood-based tests that analyse circulating tumour DNA, or ctDNA, can detect biologically active disease, early relapse, and treatment resistance months before scans reveal any change.In the Indian context, where repeated imaging is expensive and often inaccessible, such tests could help reduce unnecessary scans and ineffective treatments. Used carefully, genomics may lower overall costs while enabling more precise, timely care.Oral cancer does not hide. It appears in the open. The tragedy is not that it cannot be seen, but that it so often is not looked at in time, said experts.","Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply.

'Working to spread hatred against Muslims': Owaisi slams Assam CM’s ‘point-blank shot’ video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-to-spread-hatred-against-muslims-owaisi-slams-assam-cms-point-blank-shot-video/articleshow/128096040.cms,"NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday launched a broadside against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a video posted by the BJP showing Sarma taking a “point-blank shot” at two individuals identified as minorities.During a rally at Telangana's Zaheerabad, Owaisi accused the Assam chief minister of spreading hate against the Muslim community and added that the AIMIM would soon lodge a police complaint over the video.“If you think that communalism has ended, remember, no matter who comes to power, the poison of communalism persists. And the remedy, the antidote for the poison of communalism, is that you make the representatives of the Majlis successful. You see that in the country, the chief minister of Assam makes a video where he has a gun in his hand. And he fires a bullet. The bullet hits a person wearing a beard and a cap,” Owaisi said.“Tell me, he is the chief minister of Assam from the BJP. He posts a video from the BJP's social media. Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen strongly condemns that video. And Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, God willing, will also file a complaint with the police against it, so that a case can be registered against the chief minister of Assam.They are working to spread religious hatred against Muslims,” he added.Also read | 'I want to give you Rs 2 in alms': Owaisi hits out at Himanta Sarma over 'trouble Miya Muslims' remark This comes after the BJP Assam unit posted a video on X showing Sarma purportedly aiming a rifle at two people, one wearing a skull cap and another with a beard. The video was deleted after receiving backlash.Earlier, Owaisi had slammed Sarma over his controversial remarks on “troubling Miya Muslims”, calling them unconstitutional and divisive.Owaisi mocked the chief minister, saying, “I want to give you Rs 2 as alms,” and accused him of reducing constitutional governance to prejudice and intimidation. In a lengthy response, Owaisi said India’s Constitution guarantees equality and non-discrimination, regardless of religion or community.“The Constitution says all are equal. No discrimination should be done, whether it is a chief minister or anyone else,” he said.Owaisi alleged that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam were being scapegoated for issues ranging from migration to rising prices.“If vegetable prices increase in Assam, Miya Muslims are blamed. If someone wants to vote, they are told to go to Bangladesh,” he said, adding that such rhetoric amounted to targeting a community for political gain.The AIMIM leader's remarks came after Sarma made statements encouraging action against “Miya Muslims” in Assam.Sarma said, “Trouble the Miya Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam... We are directly against the Miya Muslims. We are not hiding anything.”The comments triggered a political storm in the election-bound northeastern state, with opposition parties accusing the BJP of resorting to communal polarisation to consolidate votes.The BJP, however, has long maintained that its focus in Assam is on addressing illegal immigration and protecting indigenous rights.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","St steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

PM Modi sets May deadline to prioritise quality improvement of highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-sets-may-deadline-to-prioritise-quality-improvement-of-highways/articleshow/128085143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerned over numerous complaints about poor-quality highways in recent months, particularly during and after monsoon, PM Narendra Modi has set a May deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement and develop robust standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure accountability and consistency.TOI has learnt that while recently reviewing progress in the highway sector, Modi also asked the ministry to crack down on poorly performing and litigating contractors, a move aimed at sending a strong message to errant highway builders.This comes amid poor construction by contractors, along with inadequate supervision by consultants and govt engineers, contributing to decline in quality of highway projects.In a series of instructions, the PM has asked the ministry to devise a mechanism to ensure that blacklisted contractors are barred from participating in fresh bids, even indirectly. It has also been instructed to identify “litigative behaviour” among contractors and factor this into their ratings. Contractors with a record of frequently invoking arbitrations would get lower ratings.Taking note of the possibility of collusion between contractors and farmers, often leading to delays in land acquisition and subsequent arbitration, the ministry has been asked to conduct a detailed study of this pattern and take corrective measures.Following the directions issued after the review meeting, the ministry will also introduce a mechanism to end the practice of contractors engaging subcontractors without the approval of highway agencies, a factor that directly affects construction quality. Norms are being revised to mandate prior approval from authorities before involving any subcontractors.In another major policy shift, the ministry has also been asked to stop the practice of converting state highways (SHs) into national highways (NHs). Highway development plans, the PM has said, should be “economy-centric”, focusing on improving connectivity between economic centres.The move is significant given that the current govt has expanded the NH network from about 91,300 km in March 2014 to around 1.46 lakh km now, a 60% increase, with rapid NH development being one of its key achievements. People aware of the development said states will retain responsibility for maintaining their highways, while Centre will focus on framing quality-control norms and guiding them.Officials added that PM has also instructed the ministry to study constraints and gaps preventing high-speed corridors from operating at the desired speed of 70 kmph, as against the existing average of 50 kmph, and ensure such deficiencies are eliminated in new projects.","PM Narendra Modi has set a May deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to Japan’s House of Representatives, expressing confidence that bilateral ties between India and Japan would further deepen under her leadership.Congratulating her on the outcome, PM Modi underlined the importance of India–Japan ties, which are anchored in a Special Strategic and Global Partnership and play a key role in regional and global stability.In a post on X, he wrote, “Congratulations Sanae Takaichi on your landmark victory in the elections to the House of Representatives. Our Special Strategic and Global Partnership plays a vital role in enhancing global peace, stability and prosperity. I am confident that under your able leadership, we will continue to take the India-Japan friendship to greater heights.”Takaichi secured a sweeping mandate in the snap lower house elections, consolidating her position just months after becoming Japan’s first woman prime minister. Her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), along with coalition partners is expected to command a strong two-thirds majority, giving her government a decisive edge to push its legislative agenda.Takaichi, 64, emerged as Japan’s prime minister in October after winning the leadership of the LDP, becoming the country’s first woman to hold the office.Known for her tough stance on defence, economic security and China, she has positioned herself as a strong advocate of closer cooperation with the United States and like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region.Her victory marks a turnaround for the LDP after years of political turbulence marked by inflation, funding scandals and voter discontent.The decisive mandate is expected to give Takaichi greater authority to pursue policy reforms, including increased defence spending, economic stimulus measures and a more assertive foreign policy.","PM Narendra Modi congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to Japan’s House of Representatives.

‘Have To Stay United’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat On Atrocities Against Hindus In Bangladesh

RSS chief must be Hindu, caste not a criterion

Organisation focuses on values, not campaigning

Language and anti-corruption stance

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the organisation had asked him to continue working despite completing 75 years of age, adding that he would step down whenever the Sangh directs him to do so.Speaking during an interactive session at an event marking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s centenary, Bhagwat said there is no election for the post of RSS chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.“There is no election to the post of RSS chief. Regional and divisional heads appoint the chief. Generally, it is said that after turning 75, one should work without holding any post,” Bhagwat said.He added that after informing the organisation about turning 75, he was asked to continue.“I have completed 75 years and informed the RSS, but the organisation asked me to continue working. Whenever the RSS asks me to step down, I will do so, but retirement from work will never happen,” he said.Bhagwat said the RSS does not follow community-based representation and that volunteers rise through the ranks based on their work. He asserted that the RSS chief will always be a Hindu, irrespective of caste and the post goes to the best available candidate.“If I were to choose a chief, I would go by the ‘best available candidate’ criterion,” he said, adding that belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe communities is not a disqualification, just as being a Brahmin is not a qualification.The RSS chief said the organisation’s work was about inculcating “sanskar” or values, and not campaigning.“Excessive campaigning leads to publicity and then arrogance,” he said, adding that publicity should be measured and timely.In a lighter remark, Bhagwat said the Sangh “extracts work till the last drop of blood from its volunteer” and that there has never been a situation where someone had to be retired.Bhagwat said English would never be the medium of communication for RSS functioning as it is not an Indian language, though it is used where necessary.He also said the RSS works geographically and does not target any caste or community.On corruption, Bhagwat said the RSS supports anyone fighting it. “Our volunteers are told to support those who fight corruption,” he said, adding that corruption lies in people’s minds, not the system.He also urged people to detect and report illegal infiltrators to authorities and said caste-based reservations should continue “as long as needed,” while stressing the need for social unity.","Mohan Bhagwat says there is no election for the post of RSS chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.

Isro study shows safe patch near Moon’s Mons Mouton for Chandrayaan-4 landing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-study-shows-safe-patch-near-moons-mons-mouton-for-chandrayaan-4-landing/articleshow/128085691.cms,"ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

BENGALURU: Scientists from Isro ’s Space Applications Centre (SAC) have identified a promising landing zone in the rugged south polar region of the Moon for India’s first lunar sample return mission, Chandrayaan-4.A detailed terrain study using images from the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) has shortlisted a one-square-kilometre patch near Mons Mouton as the safest option for touchdown. The study, carried out by Amitabh, K Suresh, Ajay K Prashar, Kannan V Iyer, Abdul S, Shweta Verma Trivedi and Nitant Dube, has been accessed by TOI.Chandrayaan-4 will be Isro’s most complex lunar mission. The spacecraft will include a propulsion module, a descender module, an ascender module, a transfer module and a re-entry module. The descender and ascender stack must soft-land on the Moon, collect samples and launch them back to lunar orbit for return to Earth .Selecting the right site is crucial. Engineers must ensure gentle local slopes, adequate sunlight for at least 11-12 days, clear radio visibility to Earth, and minimal hazards such as craters and boulders. The lander design limits the acceptable slope to about 10° and requires boulders smaller than 0.32 metres .Earlier assessments based on coarser data had highlighted several candidate areas between 84° and 90° south latitude. The new work focused on five zones around Mons Mouton, analysing them with sharper OHRC stereo images at 32-centimetre resolution. One site was discarded because it lay in permanent shadow .Researchers generated digital elevation models at a fine grid of 0.32 metres and studied terrain undulations, illumination patterns and hazard distribution. Four locations, labelled MM-1, MM-3, MM-4 and MM-5, were compared on parameters such as mean slope, height range and the number of safe landing grids of 24 by 24 metres .Among them, the MM-4 area — at latitude minus 84.289° and longitude 32.808° — emerged as the front-runner. It showed the lowest hazard level at 9.89%, an average slope of 5° and the highest count of 568 safe grids. The region also offered favourable illumination and limited shadowing from nearby terrain .Other sites carried higher risks. MM-1 and MM-3 recorded hazard levels above 12%, while MM-5 provided only 72 safe grids within the target area. Elevations across the sites ranged from 4,800 to over 6,100 metres, reflecting the broken topography of the lunar south pole .Scientists say the analysis demonstrates how high-resolution imaging can guide precise landing decisions. The OHRC data allowed them to map craters, boulders and slopes with a clarity not available during earlier missions .If approved by the landing site selection committee, the MM-4 patch will host India’s first attempt to bring back pieces of the Moon. Success would place Isro among a small group of space agencies capable of returning extraterrestrial samples, opening a new chapter in the country’s planetary exploration programme.","Scientists from Isro ’s Space Applications Centre (SAC) have identified a promising landing zone in the rugged south polar region of the Moon for India’s first lunar sample return mission, Chandrayaan-4.

Nayara's future unsure: India may bargain with US for Russian crude,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nayaras-future-unsure-india-may-bargain-with-us-for-russian-crude/articleshow/128084437.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if India does not stop buying Russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of Nayara refinery in Jamnagar.The crisis facing the refinery has triggered talks about change of ownership. While the refinery, under normal circumstances, would qualify to be a good buy, US's hardline stance may prove to be a dampener for prospective buyers, something which is going to persist unless there is a dramatic breakthrough in the talks to get Russia to pause its aggression against Ukraine.Rosneft - Russia's state-run energy giant that has been sanctioned by the Trump administration in order to pressure Vladimir Putin into agreeing to pause his offensive against Ukraine - owns majority stake in the 20 million metric tonnes per annum refinery. Located at Vadinar (Gujarat), Nayara, the country's second-largest single-site refinery, specialises in processing heavy crude. Until the US sanctions were imposed, it was almost entirely dependent on Russian crude as feedstock.Analysts said with the immediate future of the refinery in mind, India may continue negotiating with the Trump administration to allow import of smaller volumes of Russian crude.Indian refineries have been cutting down on purchase of Russian crude.Though observers said India cannot immediately halt purchases even if it decides to reduce dependence on Urals as refiners have already booked Russian cargoes for the next eight to 10 weeks and cancelling them is not feasible, it does not remove the uncertainty about the fate of Nayara.""My sense is that India will still bargain with the US to import some amount of oil from Russia, especially for Nayara refinery,"" said Prashant Vasisht, senior V-P at ratings agency ICRA.Energy expert Narendra Taneja said India will continue importing oil from Russia too, though volumes would decline. ""India will continue to get oil supplies from Russia for two reasons - to assert its strategic autonomy and to maintain the right optics for domestic political consumption,"" he said.""Since India has to make purchases of $500 billion from the US over a period of five years - imports of oil, gas and LPG are the best way to clock the numbers up quickly, which overall is not a bad idea since what we are going to back in return (capital, technology and bigger access to American markets) is quite attractive,"" he said.India imports almost one-third of its crude from Russia, and purchases fell to $2.7 billion in Dec 2025 - the lowest monthly value of shipments in the last three years - and nearly 27% lower than the $3.7 billion recorded in Nov, according to commerce department data.Despite the decline, Russia remained the largest crude supplier to India in 2025-26, accounting for 31.5% of purchases worth $105.1 billion during April-Dec.","US President Donald Trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if India does not stop buying Russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of Nayara refinery in Jamnagar.

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

The pattern

A timeline of ties and tensions

1998–99: The first alliance and the big collapse

2004: Reunion

2016-2019: Post-Amma era

2021-2023: Together, then apart again

2026: Another comeback

Why they need each other in 2026

BJP's compulsion

EPS’s doubts about the BJP

Eyeing an entry in Tamil Nadu

A 'natural alliance'

Caste arithmetic

What next?

NEW DELHI: Once upon a time, the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK pulled the plug on a vulnerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre. The withdrawal of support in 1999 triggered the NDA's collapse after a no-confidence motion, forcing midterm Lok Sabha elections. For the BJP, it was not merely a political setback but a stinging lesson in the fragility of coalition politics.By any measure, the 1999 episode could be read as a betrayal. And yet, nearly three decades on, history appears to be folding in on itself.With the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections just months away, the BJP has formally sealed an alliance with the AIADMK, now led by former chief minister and party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS). The objective is unmistakable: to build a formidable front aimed at unseating the incumbent DMK government under chief minister M K Stalin From 1999 to 2026, the relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion. Despite repeated breakups, political compulsions have ensured that the two parties keep finding their way back to each other.While the BJP and AIADMK share a long history of alliances, the relationship has rarely been smooth. It has unravelled abruptly more than once, exposing deep mistrust beneath the surface.The most dramatic rupture came in 1999, when Jayalalithaa withdrew support to the Vajpayee government, leading to its collapse by a single vote.Yet, within a few years, the two parties were back together. That cycle has repeated itself multiple times since then – most recently after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when they fought separately, only to return to the same negotiating table ahead of the 2026 assembly polls.The story of BJP-AIADMK ties is therefore less about ideology and more about arithmetic – a relationship driven by necessity.In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, which paved the way for BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee to become prime minister, the BJP extended a conciliatory hand to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK. The partnership, however, proved short-lived. Within a year, the AIADMK withdrew its support from the NDA, bringing down the vulnerable Vajpayee-led multiparty government.The rupture came against the backdrop of multiple corruption cases against Jayalalithaa and her fraught relationship with the DMK. The Supreme Court dealt a blow to her legal strategy by upholding the constitution of special courts and rejecting attempts to transfer the cases back to regular courts. This judicial setback hardened her political stance, culminating in the withdrawal of support from the Centre.In a dramatic turn, the rival DMK, led by veteran Dravidian leader M Karunanidhi, stepped in to extend support to the Vajpayee government, which went on to complete a full five-year term.Months ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK severed ties with the BJP-led NDA. The saffron party then turned once again to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK, forging a fresh alliance in Tamil Nadu. The experiment, however, yielded little electoral dividend, with the BJP failing to win a single seat in the state.Nationally, the NDA’s “India Shining” campaign lost its sheen, paving the way for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance to return to power at the Centre, with Manmohan Singh taking over as prime minister.In May 2004, then BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters in Chennai that the alliance with the AIADMK had been forged specifically for the elections—by then already over—signifying the largely tactical nature of the tie-up.Following the death of veteran politician and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa in late 2016, the party that had ruled Tamil Nadu for decades was plunged into intense factionalism. A bitter succession battle unfolded, with multiple claimants emerging in the post-Amma era, including the Sasikala family, O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami, who eventually consolidated his position and now heads the party.During this period, while a formal alliance was absent, the AIADMK began extending policy-based support to the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre.The relationship eventually culminated in an electoral alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The experiment, however, ended in a rout, with the AIADMK-BJP combine losing 39 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Despite the 2019 debacle, the AIADMK-BJP alliance continued into the 2021 Assembly polls. The result was another defeat: AIADMK won just 66 seats, BJP managed four, and the DMK-Congress alliance stormed back to power under Stalin.The results suggested that the alliance helped the BJP gain a foothold but did little for the AIADMK.By 2022, the BJP contested local body polls alone. Ties finally snapped in 2023 after the BJP’s then state chief K Annamalai made controversial remarks on Jayalalithaa, triggering outrage within the AIADMK.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.Once again, political necessity trumped past bitterness.For much of the past year, negotiations between the BJP and the AIADMK have been anything but decisive. The EPS-led AIADMK has repeatedly vacillated, weighing and re-weighing the costs and benefits of embracing the BJP as a partner to take on what is widely seen as a strong and entrenched Stalin-led DMK.Despite the prolonged uncertainty, the deal now appears almost final. All indications suggest that the two parties are set to formally revive the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu just ahead of the polls.As the election drumbeat grows louder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, undoubtedly the BJP’s most potent electoral face over the past decade, is scheduled to visit Madurai in the last week of February. In a symbolic show of unity, Palaniswami is expected to share the stage with PM Modi at a BJP-led rally, signalling that old animosities may finally be set aside.Tamil Nadu remains one of the BJP’s weakest links – a state where the saffron party has struggled to translate its national dominance into local relevance.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.Amit Shah , in particular, has sharpened his attacks on the Stalin government, accusing it of being “the most corrupt in the country” and of undermining Hindu values. His rhetoric often positions the AIADMK as a “natural ally,” a party that straddles the line between secular Dravidian politics and a softer form of Hindu assertion.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance.The AIADMK’s hesitation is rooted in precedent. The BJP has a track record of entering alliances as a junior partner, often presenting itself as a supportive force with access to power at the Centre, only to eventually upend the balance and emerge as the dominant player.The most recent example is Bihar. Like the AIADMK, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has been an on-again, off-again ally of the BJP and was long regarded as the “big brother” in the state. That equation changed dramatically in November 2025, when the BJP, for the first time, emerged larger than the JD(U) in terms of seats, even while conceding the chief minister’s post to Nitish Kumar.While the BJP is still far from posing an immediate threat to the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, the insecurity within the EPS camp is palpable.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states where the BJP’s organisational presence is weaker than that of the Congress, a party that has been in steady national decline for over a decade.To rebuild a broader NDA, the BJP is reaching out to a range of regional players. T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK is already signalling interest in joining hands, while talks are ongoing with Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S Ramadoss. Former allies and breakaway factions are also being courted as part of a larger consolidation exercise.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.In New Delhi, the AIADMK is seen as the BJP’s primary vehicle for political relevance in the southern state, a view that reflects the urgency of Amit Shah’s strategy.Calling the BJP-AIADMK tie-up a “natural alliance,” Shah argued that the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections would have been very different had the two parties contested together.“We fought together in 1998, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and in the 2021 assembly polls. But in 2024, we contested separately. If our vote shares are to be combined, we would have won 36 seats,” he said, adding that 2024 and 2025 had been victorious years for the BJP in several states and that the trend would repeat in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Tamil Nadu BJP chief Nainar Nagenthran echoed the sentiment, claiming widespread public disillusionment with the DMK government. He blamed former minister Senthil Balaji for the Karur stampede during actor-politician Vijay’s TVK rally.These public assertions are aimed at projecting confidence, yet they also underline a deeper truth: without the AIADMK, the BJP has little realistic chance of expanding in Tamil Nadu on its own.The AIADMK’s electoral strategy continues to focus on Dalits and Thevars – communities that together account for roughly one-third of the state’s electorate. The BJP, in contrast, is pursuing a broader Hindu consolidation strategy that often cuts across Tamil Nadu’s complex caste equations.The NDA could also benefit from the support of the Vanniyars, who make up around 15 per cent of the population and are largely represented by the PMK.EPS himself brings caste capital to the alliance. A Gounder, classified under the Backward Classes, he represents a community that constitutes around 7 per cent of the state’s population and is concentrated in the Kongu Nadu belt.After years of mistrust, breakups and reconciliations, both parties now appear determined to hold hands against the Stalin government.Palaniswami has called the AIADMK-BJP alliance “essential” to unseat what he terms an “anti-people” DMK government.“AIADMK will capture power with absolute majority in 2026… Never in the history of Tamil Nadu has there been such a corrupt, incompetent anti-people government,” EPS said.Amit Shah struck a similar tone, accusing the DMK of dynastic politics and corruption, and declaring that the NDA would remove the Stalin government “at all cost.”From 1999 to 2026, the BJP and AIADMK have parted ways more than once, only to reunite when elections approach. Whether this latest reunion becomes a durable partnership or another short-lived truce will ultimately be decided by the Tamil voter.","The relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion.

This is often called “in-orbit snooping or space watch”.Using its 80-kg earth-observation satellite ABA First Runner (AFR), Azista Space took images of the International Space Station (ISS), which is orbiting at an altitude of around 400 km from the Earth’s surface.AFR, which was launched in space by SpaceX's Falcon-9 as part of the Transporter-8 mission on June 13, 2023, has already completed 2.5 years in orbit.In a post of X, Azista Space, which has a manufacturing facility for satellites and payloads in Gujarat’s Sanand, said it has “successfully executed a challenging near-horizon demonstration targeting the ISS. Operating in sunlit conditions at ranges of approximately 250 km and 300 km, the AFR sensor was precisely tasked to track ISS, capturing it in 15 distinct frames. Two independent attempts were conducted, both achieving 100% success.“The resulting acquisition resulted in the image with 2.2m sampling, validating our tracking algorithms and imaging precision. To our knowledge, AFR is the only Indian built and operated satellite to have demonstrated such a feat,” said the company, which is Asia’s first private satellite factory that annually produces 50 satellites.India currently has more than 50 operational satellites — for communication, navigation, earth observation, and surveillance purposes. Protecting these space assets requires timely information about the activities of other satellites in the vicinity, especially during heightened geopolitical tensions.The rare feat is a key step towards strengthening India's space situational awareness (SSA), which means comprehensive monitoring, tracking and prediction of man-made satellites, space debris, and natural objects (like asteroids) in Earth's orbit. It is critical to ensure the safety and sustainability of space activities by analysing potential collisions and enabling avoidance maneuvers. “Azista Space also brings strong electro-optical payload, image processing and satellite bus engineering capabilities, enabling the design, development, and delivery of end-to-end SSA satellites and payloads tailored to customer mission requirements,” the company said.The company undertakes design, development, manufacturing and integration of satellites, space-borne systems and payloads, and also manufactures tailored-made satellites and satellite subsystems. Its personnel are also involved in over 12 Isro missions.",Azista Space has demonstrated a new indigenous capability in space by taking images of objects in orbit from another satellite.

Young J&K MLA draws praise from across the aisle for House speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/young-jk-mla-draws-praise-from-across-the-aisle-for-house-speech/articleshow/128081626.cms,"JAMMU: A young BJP legislator in J&K Saturday drew rare praise from across the political aisle with her speech in the Assembly, which she confined strictly to budgetary issues in the otherwise highly polarised House.Devyani Singh Rana, 31, is the daughter of former Nagrota MLA Devender Rana, who died in 2024 after winning the assembly election. In Oct 2025, BJP fielded Devyani from Nagrota in the bypoll, which she won. After her father’s death, Devyani had joined BJP and was appointed vice-president of the J&K BJP Yuva Morcha in Jan 2025.While governing National Conference legislators focused on J&K’s special status, BJP used the debate to highlight what it described as developmental gains after the abrogation of Article 370.Devyani, however, flagged electricity shortages, raised concerns over the union territory’s growing climate vulnerabilities, education sector and transportation as members listened to her raptly for around 12 minutes.In her speech, she deprecated Rs 271-cr reduction in disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department allocation, saying the sharp cut comes in a year that saw unprecedented and intense rainfall that devastated large parts of rural Jammu.Referring to tragedies in her constituency, she cited the death of three-year-old Mahi in a landslide and 28-year-old Sheer Khan, who drowned in a river. “These names represent the lives lost in the Jammu division,” she said, calling for stronger flood and landslide management measures.About flash floods that hit Jammu last year, Rana said, people lost their lives, bridges were damaged, roads became unsafe and houses were destroyed. “Our children were stranded at home and in colleges. Apple trucks were stuck on the Jammu–Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), and our traders suffered losses,” she said. She called for more allocation in disaster management as Jammu and Kashmir, she said, is “earthquake-prone, landslide-prone and fire-prone. ”Devyani also flagged under-spending in the social sectors. “If around Ra 193 crore is spent less on education, then how will the children of poor families be uplifted,” she said.She also pointed to a reduction of Rs 782.8 crore in power capital expenditure, saying it comes at a time when voltage remains unstable and transformers frequently fail.While welcoming the initiative of free bus travel for persons with disabilities, the MLA questioned its effective implementation. “Are these buses adequately equipped with ramps and access mechanisms? And when there have been documented cases of buses failing to stop even for women, what deterrent exists to ensure compliance?” she asked.As she ended her speech, members from the NC, BJP and PDP thumped their tables and crossed over to her seat to congratulate her.Devyani holds a degree in economics from the University of California. The eldest of three siblings — two sisters and a brother — she is a businesswoman who took over the management of the family business after her father’s death. “I feel humbled and very blessed by the response to my speech. We all work for the public good,” Devyani told TOI.She said since the ongoing Assembly session is the budget session, she preferred to focus on the budget only to identify problem areas that could be addressed in coming years. “I chose to speak in English because the budget across all quarters is presented and discussed in English,” she said.","Devyani Singh Rana, 31, is the daughter of former Nagrota MLA Devender Rana.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has criticised Left politics as a ""retrograde ideology"" which has lost a lot of ground, even as he praised BJP MP from Kerala, C Sadanandan Master's maiden speech in Rajya Sabha, and admired his courage after he lost his legs in a brutal attack by alleged supporters of CPM over three decades ago.Master had put his prosthetic legs on display as he delivered his speech in the House on Feb 2 to highlight the brutality of his CPM rivals, a charge rejected by the party's members.Modi said, ""Your courage is widely known in Kerala and to a lot of us, but when you displayed the artificial limbs that support you, it surprised people in Parliament and across the length and breadth of India. People were unable to digest how in a vibrant democracy like ours, a hardworking teacher could be attacked like this by followers of a retrograde ideology."" He added, ""And today, it is worth noting that the retrograde ideology has shrunk greatly, while you are sitting proudly in Parliament! The manner in which a few MPs were mocking you and questioning your struggles was appalling even by their own dismal standards. "" Modi, however, did not directly mention the Left parties.The PM echoed Sadanandan's anguish over the political situation in poll-bound Kerala, saying people are tired of the Congress-led UDF and CPM-led LDF, two principal rivals in a state where BJP has made some gains but remains a distant third so far.Modi recalled his recent visit to Thiruvananthapuram and said the welcome he got was exceptional. ""The presence of youngsters in particular was gladdening to see. It shows that the people of Kerala are appreciating our vision of Vikasita Keralam. I am sure you are happy that Kerala will benefit significantly from the recently presented budget and its provisions across a wide range of sectors,"" he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has criticised Left politics as a ""retrograde ideology"" He praised BJP MP from Kerala, C Sadanandan Master's maiden speech in Rajya Sabha.

India's electronics manufacturing has grown sharply over the past 11 years, with production rising about six-fold and exports jumping eight-fold, govt told Rajya Sabha on Friday, adding that India has now emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.Sharing official figures in the House, MoS for electronics and IT Jitin Prasada said electronics production climbed from about Rs 1.9 lakh crore in 2014-15 to nearly Rs 11.3 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports rose from around Rs 0.4 lakh crore to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore over the same period.Mobiles have been the biggest growth engine. Production increased sharply from roughly Rs 0.2 lakh crore in 2014-15 to about Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports surged from nearly Rs 1,000 crore to close to Rs 2 lakh crore - a more than 100-fold rise.Govt attributed much of this momentum to production linked incentive scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing, launched in 2020. Under the scheme, mobile phone output rose from Rs 2.14 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports expanded from nearly Rs 0.3 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore.Officials also said India has turned into a net exporter of mobile phones, reversing its position as an importer a decade ago.Till Dec 2025, the mobile PLI scheme attracted investments of over Rs 15,000 crore and generated over 1.7 lakh additional jobs, Prasada told Parliament. He added PLI 2.0 for IT hardware, launched in 2023, has so far led to cumulative production of over Rs 16,500 crore, with investments of about Rs 857 crore and nearly 4,800 direct jobs.With factories scaling up and exports rising steadily, govt said India is strengthening its position as a reliable global hub for electronics manufacturing.","India has now emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.

NEW DELHI: Country’s apex highway builders organisation has sought PM Narendra Modi ’s intervention to review the squeezed construction timelines for big highway projects on PPP, their overall bankability and modification in dispute redressal through arbitration.The National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF), in a letter addressed to the PM, has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in which a two-year construction period has been set.“Considering the scale of such projects and the scope of activities involving land availability, utility shifting, major and minor structures, interchanges, safety provisions and stringent quality standards, the industry apprehends that such timelines may pose significant execution challenges, even best efforts,” NHBF said.It has cited how the Delhi-Vadodara Greenfield Expressway, despite focused attention and continuous efforts by stakeholders, is yet to be completed even after more than five years from commencement. It has urged govt to set realistic construction timelines to ensure quality and timely completion.It has also raised its concern over the recent amendments to dispute resolution provisions of PPP agreements, wherein arbitration for disputes above Rs 10 crore has been restricted.The changes have been made with reference to the finance ministry’s June 2024 circular.NHBF has said that while arbitration has been curtailed, “well-advised and financially strong participants may still bid, but disputes — if they arise — are likely to go to courts”. It said in such a scenario, even relatively small contractual issues may result in prolonged litigation, disruption to project execution and escalation of claim values, ultimately leading to higher fiscal exposure for govt, rather than faster or more efficient dispute resolution.“There is also a concern that such a framework may inadvertently encourage the emergence of entities oriented more towards litigation-driven outcomes than execution, and that even minor disputes could potentially lead to complete stalling of projects, which may not align with the original objectives of the PPP highway programme,” the highway builders body said.",The National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF) has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in which a two-year construction period has been set.

'Why Was My Life Ruined?': Tej Pratap Yadav's Ex-Wife Lashes Out at Lalu, Rabri, Tejashwi Yadav

NEW DELHI: Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child, calling the claims false and defamatory.He accused political rivals and former associates of deliberately spreading misinformation and said that he would take legal action Addressing a late-evening press conference, former Bihar minister said that the rumours had caused him severe mental distress and were part of a targeted campaign to malign him. He claimed the speculation resurfaced months after a controversy that led to his expulsion from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), headed by his father Lalu Prasad.“I am distraught at rumours on social media that a woman with whom I had been falsely linked several months ago, which resulted in my expulsion from the party, has given birth to my child,” Yadav said.Providing background to the controversy, Yadav recalled that a post had gone viral last year from his Facebook account, claiming he had been “in a relationship, for 12 years” with a woman. He reiterated that the post was not authored by him and alleged that his social media account had been compromised.He claimed the post was the result of “hacking” carried out by what he described as “the five Jaichands,” using a metaphor for traitors.Naming them publicly, Yadav said, “There has been some suspense about who the Jaichands I have been speaking about are. Here are the names — Mukesh Raushan, Sanjay Yadav, Shakti Singh Yadav, Rameez and Sunil Singh.”Notably, Sanjay Yadav is a sitting RJD Rajya Sabha MP, Sunil Singh is a member of the legislative council, Mukesh Raushan and Shakti Singh Yadav are former MLAs and Rameez is considered close to Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and the RJD’s national working president.Rejecting the latest claims outright, Yadav told reporters, “I reject this completely, a controversy was created, Akash Bhati will be revealing the truth. They are trying to defame me. I will go to court.”He said he became aware of the rumours after being told that union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had “congratulated” him on the alleged birth of a child, which he said shocked him.Yadav also linked the renewed controversy to his recent political activities. “Recently, I hosted a well-attended feast on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. This has made my detractors wary of the prospects of my party. I will seek legal action against them. I will move the court. I have also sought an appointment with Home Minister Samrat Choudhary,” he said.Appealing for an end to the speculation, he added, “I beg my detractors to let me live in peace. I know the person with whom the woman is in a relationship and who, I believe, is the father of the child. They are causing mental anguish to me by dragging my name.”Tej Pratap Yadav was expelled from the RJD last year for what the party described as “serious breaches of moral and social values,” following a public fallout triggered by the viral Facebook post.The episode added to long-running controversies surrounding him, including his strained marriage with Aishwarya, the granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai.Aishwarya had left their matrimonial home within months of the wedding, alleging mistreatment, and the divorce case is still pending in court.Since his expulsion, Yadav has floated his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janata Dal and has repeatedly ruled out any return to the RJD, saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” He has maintained that his political journey is guided by “principles and self-respect,” not by the pursuit of power.",Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child.

India Can Wait Out Trump: Ajit Doval Warned Marco Rubio Against Bullying On Trade Deal, Says Report

NEW DELHI: India and Canada have agreed to formulate a ""shared work plan"" to guide cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues with a larger plan to have practical collaboration to address mutual concerns such as transnational criminal networks.The decision was taken at a meeting between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart Nathalie Drouin in Ottawa on Saturday.The move is seen as part of efforts by the two sides to normalise their relations that came under severe strain following a diplomatic row over the killing of a Khalistani separatist in 2023.NSA Doval's visit to Ottawa came as the two sides are making preparations for a likely trip to India early next month by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), sharing details of the Doval-Drouin meeting, said on Sunday that the two sides acknowledged the progress on initiatives aimed at supporting the safety and security of their countries and citizens.""They agreed to a shared work plan to guide bilateral cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues and to enable practical collaboration on respective priorities,"" it said.""During the meeting, it was agreed that each country would establish security and law-enforcement liaison officers and that their respective agencies would build on working relationships,"" the MEA said in a statement.It said this ""important step"" will help streamline bilateral communications and enable timely information sharing on issues of ""mutual concern"" such as the ""illegal flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl precursors, and transnational organized criminal networks"".""They also committed to formalising cooperation on cybersecurity policy and information sharing on cybersecurity issues, as well as continuing discussions on cooperation related to fraud and immigration enforcement, consistent with domestic laws and international obligations,"" it said.NSA Doval also had a meeting with Canada's Minister for Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree on Friday.The India-Canada relations hit rock bottom following then prime minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in 2023 of a potential Indian link to the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.India had dismissed Trudeau's accusation as ""absurd"".In October 2024, India recalled its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Ottawa attempted to link them to the Nijjar case.

A stream of hope flows in Bundelkhand through 'Har Ghar Nal',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-stream-of-hope-flows-in-bundelkhand-through-har-ghar-nal/articleshow/128078386.cms,"-

LUCKNOW: For the people of Bundelkhand, this is nothing short of a dream come true that water is now available inside their homes. There are countless stories of hunger, poverty, and hardship linked to water scarcity in this region.The image of a woman carrying a pot of water on her head from faraway places had, for years, become the very identity of Bundelkhand’s districts.For decades, women here endured the water crisis. They walked long distances to reach remote wells and stood in queues at handpumps to collect water. But all this is now part of the past. Today, water tanks visible from afar stand as flowing streams of hope.This scene in Bundelkhand can captivate anyone. In Marwari Gram Panchayat of Panwari block in Mahoba, a woman adjusts her veil outside her house and fills a bucket with water from a tap, while a six-year-old child stands nearby holding a glass. The happiness on the woman’s face says everything about what this tap means to her.When asked, she replies shyly, “Brother, a big crisis has been removed.” When asked whether water comes regularly, her enthusiasm is evident. “Yes, why not. It comes every day.”When asked who all have tap connections, the village head standing nearby explains in detail, “Everyone in the village has it. Water comes twice a day. One tap connection is public, where anyone passing by can drink water.”Talking about Mahoba, the people here had long endured extreme hardship due to water scarcity. At one point, water had to be supplied through water trains. People wandered far and wide just to fill a single pot of water. Now, water tanks visible from a distance tell a completely new story.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, through five projects, pipeline connectivity has been provided to more than 1.12 lakh households in the district. However, this large-scale scheme did not take shape easily. About 1,131 kilometers of roads were damaged during the work. While repair work was carried out, people did face some inconvenience.Arshad from Mahoba says that whenever a scheme begins, some inconvenience is inevitable, but “Har Ghar Nal” has emerged as a very big hope for this region.In Chitrakoot, under the Silauta Gram Mustakil Group Scheme, the water problem of about 1.25 lakh people in the development blocks of Pahadi, Ramnagar, and Manikpur has been resolved. The hardship of Manikpur’s residents can be understood from the fact that they earlier had to bring water from nearly one kilometer away.Because of this problem, people were often reluctant to marry off their daughters. For them, this water means life itself and the future of their children.Under the scheme, a total of 576 km of pipeline was planned, of which 572 km has already been laid. There are 17 overhead tanks, where water is brought daily from the water treatment plant. Water is drawn from the Yamuna River, treated at the plant, lifted into tanks, and then supplied to people’s homes.Smt. Rajjan Devi, the village head of Barhat, becomes emotional while talking about this scheme. She says, “We are grateful to the Yogi-Modi government for making arrangements to protect our children from diseases. Our children now bathe and go to school. A sense of cleanliness has automatically developed in them.”Along with Silauta, Raipura and Chandi Bangar group drinking water schemes are also being implemented in Chitrakoot. These schemes represent streams of hope that people had never even imagined.Under the Raipura Gram Samuh Peyjal Yojana, the target was to provide tap water to 19,570 families. Taps have been installed in all these houses, and water supply has begun in 60 revenue villages.Chunbad Yadav, a resident of Madna village covered under the scheme, says that a major problem has been resolved. Arranging water even for daily use was difficult earlier, and water for livestock was out of the question. Now they no longer have to worry.This may appear to be just about a tap, but for Bundelkhand, it is a blessing. It represents the fulfillment of a resolve that the Modi-Yogi government undertook as a mission.In Jhansi district, Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines have reached even the last-mile villages in Bada village, Chirgaon, and Bangra.Kamta Prasad, a 65-year-old resident of Gairaha Gram Panchayat in Bangra block, becomes emotional and says that his eyes had longed to see this day.Shagun, a married woman from this village located far from the district headquarters, says ‘earlier she had to walk half a kilometer outside the village to fetch water, and the situation became extremely difficult during the rainy season’.In Pachwara Gram Panchayat of Bangra block, when Ragini came as a daughter-in-law, she had to fetch water from a government handpump. Today, she proudly turns the tap and shows how clean the water is.The daughter-in-law of a poor family is happy that her husband Mukesh Kumar, a daily wage laborer, did not have to pay even a single rupee for the tap connection.Village head Akhilesh Rawat says, ‘about one thousand connections have been provided in his village’. In this Dalit-dominated village, the Arogya Mandir built during the Yogi government also has a tap connection under the Jal Jeevan Mission, ensuring clean drinking water for patients and attendants. Government schoolchildren are also now drinking clean water.Executive Engineer of the Jal Jeevan Mission, Ranvijay Singh, says that 42 villages are covered under this scheme, with 11,437 connections provided.Earlier, the very mention of Banda would bring to mind drought, water scarcity, and thirst. Now, through the Amlikaur Drinking Water Project and the Khatan Drinking Water Project, water has reached 544 villages, and 82,266 households have been provided connections.Pardeshi, a resident of Bandha Purwa village in Badokhar Khurd block says, ‘earlier they struggled a lot for water, but now they are receiving clean water inside their homes’.Executive Engineer of Jal Nigam, Vimal Kumar Verma says, ‘that roads dug up for pipeline laying have also been repaired’.In Hamirpur district as well, two drinking water projects are underway, through which tap water is being supplied to homes in 320 out of 322 villages. For the people here, this scheme is set to play a very significant role in transforming daily life.","The image of a woman carrying a pot of water on her head had, for years, become the very identity of Bundelkhand’s districts.

Misunderstood nature of male loneliness

Indian context

Restrictive emotionality and the cost of masculine norms

Suicide , mental illness, and gendered outcomes

Patriarchy and the myth of collective guilt

Friendship recession

Do romantic relationships solve loneliness?

Towards solutions

Cultural change:

Institutional support:

Community building:

Policy reform:

Whenever the subject of men’s loneliness or men’s mental health comes up, the conversation almost always follows the same path. It turns into a reckoning. A reminder. Sometimes even a punishment.Men built this system.Men benefit from patriarchy.Men commit violence against women.So why should we feel sorry for them now?None of this is untrue. Patriarchy is real. Gendered violence is real. Women have borne the heaviest cost of systems created and upheld largely by men. Acknowledging male loneliness does not erase that reality.But somewhere along the way, the conversation becomes so rigid that it stops seeing men as individuals and starts treating them as a single, guilty category. And that’s where something important gets lost.Because not all men are perpetrators. Not all men are powerful. And not all men feel seen by the system they are assumed to benefit from.But what about the man who genuinely respects women, who does not subscribe to regressive ideologies, who feels no ownership over the beliefs of his ancestors, and who is trying, quietly and consistently, to do what society expects of him?These men exist in large numbers, yet they are almost entirely absent from public conversations about male loneliness.This article is about them.Loneliness, despite common misconceptions, is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy. It is a subjective emotional experience characterised by a perceived gap between desired and actual social connection. Recent discussions around a so-called “male loneliness epidemic” often reduce the issue to dating failures or sexual frustration, particularly online.However, empirical research consistently shows that male loneliness extends far beyond romantic relationships. Men can be married, employed, socially functional, and still profoundly lonely.Studies suggest that men often experience loneliness differently from women. While women tend to maintain emotionally intimate friendships and family ties throughout adulthood, men are more likely to rely on structured social contexts—such as workplaces, educational institutions, or group activities—to sustain relationships. When these structures weaken or disappear, men are less likely to replace them with emotionally open connections. As a result, loneliness can persist unnoticed, even by the men experiencing it.Crucially, research also indicates that many men do not self-identify as “lonely,” even when they exhibit psychological markers associated with chronic loneliness. This disconnect is especially pronounced in India, where cultural norms discourage emotional introspection in men and valorize endurance over expression. Counselling psychologist Dr Ishita Mukerji observed this pattern repeatedly in clinical settings: “I have seen a lot of times in therapy that, you know, many male clients of mine say that I don't know what I feel. I just know something is wrong. I try to think about it but I don't get an answer. So they really don't know, right, what and how they're feeling. This confusion is not their fault. It is the result of growing up without that emotional permission. They sometimes are numb, emotionally very numb. ”India’s cultural framework places immense emphasis on masculinity as duty. Men are socialised from an early age to internalize responsibility—towards parents, siblings, spouses, children, and society at large. Emotional needs, in contrast, are often framed as indulgent or secondary. This produces what many researchers describe as a “provider burden,” where a man’s worth is tied almost exclusively to his economic utility.Recent data underscores the scale of the problem. A study conducted by the Indian Psychiatric Society found that over 20% of Indian men report experiencing loneliness. Another study by the National Sample Survey Organization revealed that nearly 45% of Indian men feel lonely, with urban men reporting the highest levels. These numbers point to a widespread phenomenon rather than isolated individual distress.Dr Mukerji explained how deeply financial instability can destabilise a man’s sense of self:“What happens is that when a person when a man loses a job, or he's earning less, or he's if he's struggling financially, it doesn't feel like a normal life to him, it actually feels like a personal failure. And this creates deep shame, stress, anxiety, and depression as well. Married men feel the pressure most. Because it's not just they responsibility for themselves, they're carrying responsibility for their wives, children, parents, extended family. They don't allow themselves to feel or say, ""I'm tired,"" or ""I'm struggling."" So when stress keeps building, and there is no emotional outlet, some men start feeling hopeless and extremely depressed.”Sanyam Kapoor, a 28-year-old product manager, when asked whether he ever feels his value as a human being is tied to his bank balance or job title, says, “I don’t want it to be, but yeah, it sneaks in. Especially when things aren’t going great financially. It’s hard not to measure yourself that way when that’s what gets noticed first.”Urbanisation has intensified this issue. Modern Indian cities often lack communal spaces that facilitate organic social bonding. Extended families have fragmented into nuclear units, neighborhoods have grown anonymous, and work hours have expanded. In this environment, men frequently find themselves socially functional but emotionally disconnected.One of the most significant psychological constructs relevant to male loneliness is “restrictive emotionality,” a term introduced by Levant in 1995. Restrictive emotionality refers to the learned inhibition of emotional expression, particularly emotions associated with vulnerability such as sadness, fear, or loneliness. According to psychologist Agneta Fischer, emotional expression is not biologically predetermined but shaped through social learning—a process heavily influenced by gender norms.In India, boys are often taught—explicitly or implicitly—that emotional restraint is a marker of strength. Crying, expressing confusion, or admitting loneliness is frequently met with ridicule or concern about masculinity. While men and women experience emotions to similar degrees, men are more likely to redirect vulnerable emotions into socially acceptable outlets such as anger, withdrawal, or stoicism.Kapoor explained why emotional restraint often feels like self-protection rather than denial.“All the time. Not because I think weakness is bad in theory — but because once you say it out loud, you can’t take it back. People look at you differently. Sometimes they worry. Sometimes they dismiss it. Either way, the dynamic changes.”This emotional suppression has tangible consequences. Chronic stress, untreated emotional distress, and prolonged loneliness can contribute to depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and physical health problems.These numbers are not abstract. In recent years, several cases have drawn public attention to the emotional distress faced by men navigating marital conflict and prolonged isolation. In one such case, a 30-year-old executive employed with a major IT firm died by suicide at his family home in Agra. Prior to his death, he recorded a video describing an overwhelming sense of loneliness and urged greater societal awareness of men’s mental health struggles, particularly the emotional isolation men experience during personal and legal disputes.""Please, someone should talk about men. They become very lonely. If laws do not protect men, then there will be no man left to be accused..."" said Manav in his note.A 22-year-old architecture student from a private engineering college in Bengaluru died by suicide last week, allegedly due to ragging. Before taking the extreme step, the student, identified as Arun, recorded a video blaming his peers and expressing emotional distress over being spoken about behind his back.A native of Hassan, Arun was a final-year architecture student who had secured a free seat at his college owing to his academic performance. His parents, daily-wage labourers, had struggled financially to support his education. Arun was also known to be a talented portrait artist. He recorded a video message detailing his anguish, mentioning that friends had been speaking ill of him behind his back.This disparity is often misunderstood. Women are statistically more likely to experience depression, yet men are significantly more likely to die by suicide. Research suggests that this paradox is linked to differences in help-seeking behavior, emotional expression, and method lethality. Men are less likely to seek professional support and more likely to reach crisis points without intervention.A 2023 study found that suicide rates among Indian men are particularly high among married men and daily wage workers—groups traditionally assumed to be socially anchored. This challenges the assumption that marriage or employment alone protect against loneliness or mental distress.A 35-year-old man, married with one child and working at a consulting firm, chose to remain anonymous. He described his life as stable, predictable—and emotionally narrow. “I wouldn’t say I’m unhappy,” he said, “but I don’t feel connected either.” Most of his close friendships gradually faded after marriage, and although he shares a home with his spouse, he feels uneasy bringing up his stress or exhaustion. “I don’t want to burden her,” he explained. “I’m supposed to handle things.”Addressing male loneliness does not negate feminist concerns, it complements them by targeting one of patriarchy’s quieter casualties.It is important to acknowledge that patriarchy harms women disproportionately and violently. However, it is also true that patriarchy diminishes men by restricting emotional expression and reducing identity to productivity. The idea that men “deserve” loneliness because they benefit from patriarchy overlooks the fact that most men do not experience power as autonomy or choice, but as obligation.Holding individual men morally accountable for historical and structural injustices obscures the real issue: systems that socialise men into emotional isolation while offering no legitimate pathways for connection.When asked, 23-year-old journalist Pranav Shukla, what stops men from talking openly about mental health, in your experience? He said, ""I think men are conditioned not to talk about it. Society often labels them as weak when they do, which makes opening up harder. That said, things are slowly changing and more men are beginning to speak openly about mental health.""Friendships are often the first relationships we form outside our families, and they play a crucial role in emotional and social development. In theory, friendships should remain one of the most important emotional anchors throughout adulthood. In practice, however, male friendships often change shape rather than deepen.Sociologist Daniel Cox coined the term “friendship recession” to describe the steady decline in close friendships across industrialised societies. While much of this research has focused on Western contexts, similar patterns are becoming increasingly visible in India as well. Men, in particular, report having fewer close friendships over time and describe greater difficulty forming new ones after early adulthood.It is important to recognise the real value that male friendships offer while also acknowledging their limitations. Many men do not lack friends, nor do they lack affection or loyalty within those friendships. What is often missing is emotional articulation. It is not that men do not want to talk about their personal victories, their disappointments, or their insecurities; rather, many hesitate because they are unsure how such openness will be received. The unspoken rule becomes one of mutual distraction—spending time together, sharing experiences, and silently hoping that presence alone will be enough.This dynamic is reflected in the experience of Ansh Srivastava, a 22-year-old software developer working in Gurgaon. ""I always have a fair guess of what’s going on in my closest friends' lives but never the whole picture. The whole point of male friendships is to spend time together through the lowest and not talk about it and feel better by the presence of their friend. I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation about my mental health or my friends’ mental health ever, it's always external events, even though he is literally a part of my family and vice versa. ""There is a persistent assumption that romantic relationships function as a remedy for male loneliness. While intimacy can provide emotional support, research indicates that relying solely on a partner for emotional fulfillment can be precarious. Men who lack broader social networks may experience intense loneliness following relationship conflict, separation, or loss.Moreover, when emotional labor is outsourced entirely to romantic partners, it can strain relationships and reinforce dependency rather than resilience.Dr Mukerji emphasised that mental health care should not be framed as a competition:“From a clinical point of view, if we talk about mental health care, it is not just about comparing who suffers more. It is about, helping people who are struggling and supporting men's mental health does not just take away from women's issues. In fact, healthier men leads to healthier families and relationships. It is very important for men to take care of their mental health irrespective of whatever is happening.”Loneliness, therefore, must be addressed as a social condition rather than an individual romantic deficit.Addressing male loneliness in India requires interventions at multiple levels:Challenging restrictive norms around masculinity and emotional expression is essential. Vulnerability must be reframed as a human capacity rather than a gendered weakness.Mental health education should be integrated into schools, workplaces, and community organizations. Affordable and accessible mental health services are critical, particularly for working-class men.Encouraging participation in community groups, sports clubs, volunteering, and peer support initiatives can help rebuild social capital.Mental health must be treated as a public health priority. Data collection, funding, and targeted programs for men at high risk of isolation are necessary.Male loneliness in India is not a fringe concern or an online exaggeration. It is a widespread, under-acknowledged phenomenon with serious consequences for mental and physical health. While patriarchy shapes this crisis, it does not justify indifference to male suffering. The men who quietly shoulder responsibility, who respect others, and who strive to meet societal expectations deserve to be seen—not as perpetrators by default, but as human beings navigating structural silence.If we are to build a society that values mental well-being, we must move beyond blame and toward understanding. Loneliness, after all, is not a moral failing. It is a signal—and one that India can no longer afford to ignore.","Loneliness is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy. It is a subjective emotional experience characterised by a perceived gap between desired and actual social connection. Indian cultural framework places immense emphasis on masculinity as duty. Emotional needs, in contrast, are often framed as indulgent or secondary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128075728,imgsize-1542358,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-2026-02-08t203429253.jpg"

NEW DELHI: “Suspected fuel starvation” — running out of fuel — reportedly caused a Red Bird training aircraft to force land in an open field about to 50 to 70 km before its destination, Belagavi, on Sunday. Luckily, both the flight instructor and student pilot on board the Cessna 172 aircraft (VT-EUC) are safe. The aircraft is damaged. Aviation authorities are probing this accident.The aviation minister said in a statement: “Redbird Flight Training Academy’s Cessna 172 aircraft while operating a cross country flight (from) Kalaburagi to Belagavi was involved in forced landing in an open field near Vijayapura Sunday due to suspected fuel starvation experienced by the aircraft. The site of forced landing is 50 to 70 km from Belagavi Airport. There were two persons on board, a flight instructor and a trainee pilot. Both the occupants of the aircraft are safe. Due to impact aircraft is damaged… Further investigation will be carried out by DGCA/AAIB.”Red Bird’s operations were briefly stopped by the DGCA in October 2023 after a series of mishaps (luckily all of them non fatal). Its operations resumed after the regulator conducted detailed checks. With 48 aircraft in its fleet, it is one of India’s biggest flying training school.The aircraft that reportedly ran out of fuel on Sunday was built in 1975. At about 300 km, Kalaburagi to Belagavi is a short sector and why the plane reportedly ran out of fuel is something that at the probe will look at.","A Red Bird training aircraft reportedly ran out of fuel and forced land in an open field 50 to 70 km before its destination, Belagavi.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, along with several party workers was detained by police on Sunday while protesting in west Delhi’s Janakpuri over the death of 25-year-old Kamal Dhyani.The protest was organised to demand justice for Dhyani, who died earlier on Thursday after his motorcycle allegedly fell into an unmarked pit.According to the AAP, Bharadwaj and other leaders had gathered in Janakpuri to pay tribute to Dhyani by lighting candles. However, Delhi police erected barricades across the area and detained the protesters.In a series of posts on X, Bharadwaj said that he was being taken away by the police and questioned the action against what he described as a peaceful tribute.“Today we had come to Janakpuri to pay tribute to Kamal Dhyaani who was killed there. The police has put up barricades everywhere today. We said no sloganeering is happening, we will just light candles and leave. Is even this much now a crime?” he wrote.He also raised political allegations in his post, claiming, “The BJP government had stolen the election through deceit and fraud exactly one year ago today, and the entire Delhi is commemorating this one-year anniversary.”Bharadwaj further demanded justice for Kamal Dhyani, action against the Delhi Police Commissioner and criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.Speaking to reporters while being detained, Bharadwaj accused the authorities of suppressing dissent. “You can see the level of dictatorship. No one lodged a complaint, even when the parents of Kamal Dhyani went to six police stations. The police are detaining us when we have all gathered to pay tribute to him,” he said.The protest follows days of sharp criticism by the AAP against the Delhi Police and the BJP-led Delhi government over Dhyani’s death.Bharadwaj has alleged police negligence and attempts to hide crucial information related to the case. He claimed that Dhyani’s family visited six police stations on the night of the incident but no missing complaint was registered and that the location data of the victim’s mobile phone was allegedly deleted.Dhyani, a resident of Janakpuri, reportedly fell into a deep pit late at night while riding his motorcycle on February 5. His family and friends have alleged that the pit was poorly barricaded and unmarked and that timely police action could have saved his life.The incident has drawn comparisons with a recent case in Noida, where a young IT professional died after his car plunged into a water-filled construction pit, renewing concerns over road safety , unmarked construction sites and accountability of civic authorities in the Delhi-NCR region.The Delhi government has said that it has taken cognisance of the Janakpuri incident and assured action against those responsible. Meanwhile, the AAP has said it will continue to raise the issue and demand accountability for what it calls a preventable tragedy.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj was detained by police on Sunday while protesting in west Delhi’s Janakpuri.

"Kerala election: Why CPM, Congress and BJP are clashing over Jamaat-e-Islami",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-election-why-cpm-congress-and-bjp-are-clashing-over-jamaat-e-islami/articleshow/128070815.cms,"From left: CPM's MV Govindan, Congress leader VD Satheesan and senior BJP leader K Surendran (File photo)

Congress pushes back

Who is Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala?

A triangular contest

The broader political calculus

NEW DELHI: As Kerala heads toward another high-stakes assembly election, a controversial name has returned to the centre of a new political storm. Jamaat-e-Islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words between the CPM , the Congress and the BJP.What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility.The latest round of exchanges was triggered after Congress leader and the leader of the opposition VD Satheesan indicated that the UDF would accept support from Jamaat-e-Islami, asserting that the organisation had clarified it does not advocate a religion-based nation in India.That remark drew immediate criticism from both the CPM and the BJP, who accused the Congress of legitimising a group they describe as communal.Senior BJP leader K Surendran accused the Congress of closeness with Jamaat-e-Islami and alleged that the party was “whitewashing” communal forces. He went further, claiming that “sharia” would be implemented in Kerala if the Congress and the UDF came to power. “The Congress has now adopted a blatant communal stand by whitewashing terrorist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami,” Surendran said.The CPM, too, sharpened its attack. State secretary M V Govindan alleged that the Congress had adopted a position portraying Jamaat-e-Islami as a non-communal organisation and accused it of attempting to give the outfit a “good certificate”.Satheesan rejected the allegations and accused the CPM of hypocrisy. He alleged that the Marxist party had itself benefited from Jamaat-e-Islami support in the past.“CPM is hypocritical. Until the parliamentary elections, they appeased minorities. Later, they appeased majority communities. Currently, there is confusion overall. They are in a state where they do not know what they are saying or doing. They are pretending to forget what they said in the past,” Satheesan said during the UDF’s Puthu Yuga Yatra in Kasaragod.He further claimed, “For 42 years, Jamaate-Islami was aligned with the CPM. Many times, individuals like Govindan and Pinarayi Vijayan were elected with the support of Jamaat-e-Islami. Clips of Pinarayi Vijayan’s speech justifying Jamaat-e-Islami and Deshabhimani’s editorial can be sent to Govindan. If his forgetfulness is deliberate, then nothing can be done.”Satheesan also argued that the opposition was unfairly being targeted for engaging with community organisations. “We do not interfere in the internal matters of any community organisations. Our wish is for everyone to walk together. It is not the opposition leader’s job to comment on any of this,” he said.In Kerala, references to Jamaat-e-Islami typically point to Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, a socio-religious organisation with an active presence in the state through educational institutions, social initiatives and community networks. Its political platform is the Welfare Party of India, which has contested elections and participated in local alliances.The organisation is not a dominant electoral force in Kerala but commands influence in certain regions, particularly in parts of northern districts. In a closely contested political landscape where margins can matter, even limited organisational backing can acquire significance.Jamaat-e-Islami has been in controversy several times for its ultra-conservative views. Only last month its leader Shaikh Muhammed Karakunnu said that no true believer who loves Prophet Muhammad can reject Islamic Republic.In a Facebook post titled ‘Would true believers reject Islamic Republic?' posted on January 17, Karakunnu said Prophet was the founder of Islamic Republic, and its headquarters was Medina and it was established without shedding even a single drop of blood.The remarks came amid the CPM's attack on Jamaat-e-Islami, accusing the organisation of subscribing to the ideology of establishing a theocratic nation.CPM leaders were quick to cite Karakunnu's remarks as vindication of their stand.""The people of that land welcomed its leader with open arms, choosing him as their ruler. They even gave their land his name: Madinatun-Nabi (The City of the Prophet). It was an ideal-based, humanitarian and pluralistic nation. At that time, the Muslim population there was only 15%,"" he said.Kerala’s politics has traditionally been bipolar, with power alternating between the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led UDF. The BJP, despite a growing vote share, has struggled to translate support into seats. In this context, debates over minority outreach and ideological positioning carry both symbolic and electoral weight.For the CPM, attacking the Congress over Jamaat-e-Islami allows it to question the UDF’s secular credentials while attempting to consolidate its own base among both minority and majority voters. For the BJP, the issue provides an opportunity to frame the Congress and the Left as engaging in minority appeasement, a narrative it has consistently deployed in Kerala.The Congress, meanwhile, appears to be balancing objectives of reassuring minority voters that it remains open to their support, while countering charges that it is endorsing communal politics.Kerala has a significant Muslim population, and minority consolidation can influence outcomes in several constituencies. Historically, the Indian Union Muslim League has been the primary Muslim political force within the UDF. However, the presence of organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami adds layers to the competitive dynamic.The CPM has previously worked with various community organisations, and its leaders have often defended engagement as part of Kerala’s plural political culture. The Congress now argues that similar engagement cannot be selectively labelled communal.The BJP’s intervention introduces a national dimension, especially as it seeks to expand its footprint in a state where it has yet to break through decisively. By raising the spectre of “sharia” and accusing the Congress of legitimising extremist forces, it seeks to polarise the debate and position itself as the defender of secular governance.The controversy has also intersected with rival mass contact programmes. While the UDF is conducting its Puthu Yuga Yatra to present what it describes as a vision for Kerala’s future, the LDF is running the Vikasana Munnetta Jatha to highlight development initiatives under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Each side has used the Jamaat-e-Islami debate to undercut the other’s campaign narrative. Satheesan has suggested that the CPM’s criticism stems from discomfort over the UDF’s electoral confidence, while CPM leaders argue that the Congress is attempting to normalise communal elements.At its core, the clash over Jamaat-e-Islami reflects deeper tensions in Kerala politics like how parties engage with community organisations, how secularism is defined in practice, and how minority support is negotiated in a competitive electoral field.","Jamaat-e-Islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words. What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility. The latest round of exchanges was triggered after Congress leader and the leader of the opposition VD Satheesan indicated that the UDF would accept support from the organisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128073857,imgsize-65704,width-400,resizemode-4/kerala-elections.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Sunday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, emphasising a shift toward female leadership in governance.In a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the BJP-led Delhi government, chief minister Rekha Gupta and BJP National President Nitin Nabin officially flagged off a massive fleet of 4,000 electric buses, making Delhi's EV fleet the largest in the country.Gupta credited the team's 365-day effort, saying women-led development is thriving under PM Modi's guidance adding that the event served as both a milestone for urban mobility and a celebration of the administration's ""women-led development"" philosophy.""This is the wonder of PM Modi's leadership: the women's driver, the women's secretary, and the women's chief minister, where women-led development is possible in the country. I am pleased that on 8th February, we are able to serve the people of Delhi, thanks to their trust and blessings. A large fleet of 4,000 EV buses has been handed over to the people of Delhi, making it the largest in the country. I am pleased that all our ministers and the entire government have been working for Delhi for 365 days,"" she said.The addition of 4,000 electric buses aims to drastically reduce the city's carbon footprint and modernise public transit.CM Rekha Gupta was joined by Transport Minister Pankaj Kumar Singh, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma, and National President Nitin Nabin.CM Gupta, along with Transport Minister Pankaj Kumar Singh, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma and BJP National President Nitin Nabin, flagged off electric buses and the Delhi-Panipat bus service to mark the BJP-led government's first year in office.Addressing a gathering, chief minister Rekha Gupta said that the people of Delhi ended years of neglect in development by electing the BJP government.""For eleven years, Delhi lagged behind in development. The hopes and aspirations of the people of Delhi withered away. Delhi stopped dreaming of development. The people of Delhi were left without basic amenities such as water, sewage, and healthcare. But in the 2025 assembly elections, the people of Delhi gave a befitting reply to those who claimed to be the masters of Delhi,"" CM Gupta said.""Arrogant Kejriwal used to say, 'You will have to be reborn to defeat me.' But the people of Delhi, in this very lifetime, in this very Ramlila Maidan, changed the atmosphere of Delhi by forming the BJP government. The people of Delhi showed that if they can elevate someone to a position of power with love and affection, they also know how to bring them down,"" he said.Further, transport minister Pankaj Singh said the BJP government is fulfilling its promises as it completed one year in office, announcing the introduction of 500 electric buses and improved connectivity between Delhi and Panipat.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, emphasising a shift toward female leadership in governance.

The mortal remains of 58‑year‑old Haryana Police Inspector Jagdish Prasad, who succumbed to fatal injuries sustained while rescuing people after a giant swing collapsed at the Surajkund fairgrounds, were cremated with state honours in his native Dengar village in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Prasad’s last rites were performed with full rituals on the banks of the Yamuna River, where his son Gaurav lit the funeral pyre. Hundreds of people from the village and nearby areas gathered to pay their respects, an official said, news agency PTI reported.Paying tribute to Prasad’s bravery, Palwal SP Varun Singla said every Indian is proud of his dedication and courage. The SP also consoled the family members of the late inspector.The accident occurred on Saturday evening when about 19 people were riding a giant swing at the fair around 6 pm. The swing tilted before crashing to the ground, leaving the police officer dead, and several others injured.Prasad, who joined the Haryana Armed Police in 1989 and was due to retire in March after completing 36 years of service, was among the first to respond to the accident, senior officers said. While trying to help those trapped under the collapsed structure, he sustained severe injuries that later proved fatal.Prasad’s nephew Prashant, who was at the venue at the time of the incident, described the sequence of events.“When the swing broke, Jagdish uncle was the first to engage in rescue operations. He began pulling out those trapped beneath the swing. He had already rescued some people and was still trying when the broken swing tilted too far towards him, trapping his neck. He suffered serious injuries. After this, he was taken to the hospital but could not be saved,” Prashant told news agency PTI.Speaking about the last time the family met Prasad, his son Gaurav said, “He had promised to meet again only after the fair was over, but that meeting proved to be the last. One of my sisters had to get married in November, but all shattered now.” Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini also expressed condolences and assured full support to the family saying, ""I assure the family members that the government stands with them in every possible way. We will provide all possible assistance. Along with this, the police officer who was martyred will be provided with financial security, as he was on duty there. We will also provide a government job to one of his children,"" he added, as quoted by news agency ANI.","Jagdish Prasad, 58, died after a giant swing collapsed at a fair in Haryana, India.

‘1.25 Crore Hindus In Bangladesh’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat Issues Big Unity Call

'On what grounds should he be awarded Bharat Ratna?: Congress launches sharp attack

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said that the prestige of India’s highest civilian award Bharat Ratna would increase if it is conferred to Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.The remark drew an immediate and sharp response from the Congress, which questioned both the merit and the intent behind the demand.Speaking at a public interaction in Mumbai to mark the RSS centenary, Bhagwat said that the long-pending demand for honouring Savarkar deserved serious consideration.“Bharat Ratna’s prestige will increase if the award is given to Savarkar,” he said, reiterating a position that has been echoed by sections of the Sangh Parivar and the BJP over the years.Bhagwat commented while responding to questions on a range of issues, including the Uniform Civil Code, nationalism and the role of the RSS in public life. The programme was attended by several prominent personalities from the film and cultural world.The Congress reacted strongly to Bhagwat’s statement. Party MP Imran Masood questioned the basis on which Savarkar should be awarded the Bharat Ratna and accused him of contributing to the idea of India’s partition.Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, Masood said, “On what grounds should he be awarded the Bharat Ratna? For what merit? For causing the partition of India and Pakistan?”“It was Savarkar who first propagated the idea of two nations within the country and laid the ideological foundation for the division between India and Pakistan,” he added.The latest exchange comes against the backdrop of a long-standing and politically charged debate over Savarkar’s legacy. While the BJP and its ideological affiliates project him as a freedom fighter and a key ideologue of Hindutva who suffered incarceration under British rule, the Congress has consistently opposed any move to honour him with the Bharat Ratna, citing his controversial views and alleged links to the conspiracy in Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination.The issue first gained major political traction in 2019, when the BJP’s Maharashtra unit included a promise in its election manifesto to seek the Bharat Ratna for Savarkar. The Congress had then hit out sharply, with senior leader Manish Tewari saying that conferring the award on Savarkar, especially around Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, would be deeply inappropriate.At the time, the BJP defended the demand, arguing that Savarkar was a freedom fighter who spent years in harsh imprisonment in the Andaman Cellular Jail and that many national leaders, including BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel, received the Bharat Ratna long after Independence.The demand resurfaced in 2024 as well, when Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned why the BJP-led Centre had not yet honoured Savarkar despite repeated assurances and letters from BJP leaders themselves. Thackeray said that the ruling party had no right to lecture others on Savarkar if it failed to act on its own promises.",Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat said that the prestige of India’s highest civilian award Bharat Ratna would increase if it is conferred to Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The remark drew an immediate and sharp response from the Congress.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128071358,imgsize-866915,width-400,resizemode-4/128071358.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Police on Sunday arrested the swing operator and one of his staff members, a day after an on-duty inspector was killed and 12 others were injured when a giant ‘Tsunami’ ride snapped mid-air and crashed at the Surajkund fairgrounds in Faridabad.The accident occurred on Saturday evening during the 39th Surajkund International Crafts Mela. Around 19 people were on the ride when it suddenly tilted and collapsed to the ground.Inspector Jagdish Prasad, 58, died while attempting to rescue those trapped in the swing, officials said. He had joined the Haryana Armed Police in 1989 and was scheduled to retire in March after completing 36 years of service. His body was handed over to his family on Sunday following a post-mortem examination.“A special investigation team formed to probe the incident has arrested two accused – Mohammad Shakir, a resident of Himachal Pradesh’s Sirmour district, and the proprietor of Himachal Fun Care that operated the giant swing, and Nitesh from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, who worked under Shakir. The role of others is being examined,” Yashpal, spokesperson for the Faridabad police told news agency PTI.The 12 injured include female Assistant Sub-Inspector Neelam, female constable Sharmila, Special Police Officer Rajesh, and civilians Harsh Prakash, Prashant, Amisha, Parvinder, Sunil, Shivani, Balbir, Anuj and Pooja.Five of them have been discharged after treatment, Yashpal said.Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini directed officials on Sunday to ensure strict compliance with safety standards at the fair and other public events. “The government stands firmly with the family of Jagdish Prasad in this difficult time. Those seriously injured in the accident will receive financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh each from the state government,” Saini said.The district administration said the fair would continue on Sunday, though the area around the swing has been cordoned off pending investigation.On Saturday night, Haryana director general of police (DGP) Ajay Singhal announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore for Prasad’s family and a government job for one of his relatives. He also said the inspector would be accorded martyr status.“Inspector Jagdish Prasad made a commendable effort to rescue the injured while on duty. His death is a profound tragedy for the police department.“The department will provide financial assistance to the family as much as possible, and employment will be provided to an eligible member under the compassionate leave policy,” the DGP said.On Sunday, DGP Singhal and Faridabad Commissioner Satendra Kumar Gupta met Prasad’s family to offer condolences and later visited the hospital to inquire about the injured.Tourism Director Parth Gupta and Faridabad Deputy Commissioner Ayush Sinha also inspected the fairgrounds to review security arrangements.Officials said the accident took place barely an hour after a gate collapsed at the venue, injuring two people, including a child.Police had earlier constituted a four-member Special Investigation Team led by DCP (Crime) Mukesh Kumar. The team includes ACP (Crime) Varun Dahiya and Sub-Inspector Sanjay Kumar of Surajkund police station. The SIT has been tasked with conducting a detailed probe, determining whether there was negligence, and examining compliance with safety norms.According to a complaint filed by assistant sub-inspector Sunny, he and Inspector Prasad were on duty at the fair when they noticed several people riding the ‘Tsunami’ swing. As the ride snapped mid-air, Prasad attempted to rescue those trapped. The swing then broke from one side and fell, causing serious injuries. Prasad later died in hospital.“The death of the inspector was caused due to the deliberate endangerment of people's lives by Himachal Fun Fair’s proprietor Mohammad Shakir and his staff, who did not maintain the safety standards,” the ASI stated in his complaint.Separately, the district administration has formed an inquiry committee headed by additional deputy commissioner-cum-Mela Administrator Satbir Singh.The panel includes DCP Maqsood Ahmed, Arvind Gupta, Head of the Mechanical Department at YMCA University, Hitesh Kumar, Executive Engineer (Mechanical), and Ashwini Gaur, Executive Engineer (Electrical).","Inspector Jagdish Prasad, 58, died while attempting to rescue those trapped in the swing, officials said.

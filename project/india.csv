EC crackdown: 345 unrecognised parties face delisting; failed to contest polls or verify office locations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-crackdown-345-unrecognised-parties-face-delisting-failed-to-contest-polls-or-verify-office-locations/articleshow/122103552.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at ‘cleaning the political space’, the Election Commission on Thursday initiated proceedings for delisting 345 regisered unrecognised political parties (RUPPs) that had failed to fulfil the statutory obligation of contesting even a single election in the last six years and the offices of which could not be located at the address mentioned in their registration documents.These 345 RUPPs are registered in different states and Union territories across the country.The Commission on Thursday said that it had come to its notice that of the over 2,800 RUPPs currently registered with ECI, many have failed to fulfil the essential conditions to maintain their registration status. “Thus, a nationwide exercise was conducted by the ECI to identify such RUPPs and 345 such RUPPs have been identified till now,” EC said in a statement. The review is ongoing and more such ‘non-compliant, inactive’ RUPPs may face delisting proceedings in the days to come.The chief electoral officers (CEOs) of the states/UTs where such “defaulter” RUPPs are registered, have been directed to issue show-cause notices, giving an opportunity to such parties to be heard. “The final decision regarding the delisting of any RUPP shall be taken by the Election Commission of India , based on the CEO’s report,” said an official.Political parties (National/State/RUPPs) in the country are registered with the ECI under the provisions of Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act 1951. Under this provision, any association, once registered as a political party, gets certain privileges and advantages such as tax exemptions amongst others.EC had in January 2024 made it mandatory for RUPPs to attach a declaration with their application for allotment of common poll symbol, confirming that they have filed their contribution reports and annual audit accounts for the last three financial years and election expenditure statement for the last two polls contested.Since 2022, the poll panel has delisted 284 defaulting and non-compliant RUPPs and declared 253 RUPPs inactive as part of its efforts to clean up the political space historically occupied by non-functional political parties. These parties were found to be availing benefits like 100% tax exemption on donations received without meeting the statutory requirements under the Representation of the People Act or contesting elections. Some were serving as shell companies or money laundering vehicles, while some others were fielding candidates in elections only to demand money from recognised parties for withdrawing their nomination.","The Election Commission on Thursday initiated proceedings for delisting 345 regisered unrecognised political parties. The parties had failed to fulfil the statutory obligation of contesting even a single election in the last six years.

EC sources say demand neither new nor tenable,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-sources-say-demand-neither-new-nor-tenable/articleshow/122102823.cms,"NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence that the Election Commission share a machine-readable, digital copy of the Maharashtra electoral roll, appears to have overlooked an important aspect: a similar prayer made by senior Congress leader Kamal Nath before the Supreme Court was rejected way back in 2018.Interestingly, arguing the case on behalf of the petitioner was none other than Abhishek Manu Singhvi, now member of the Congress’s Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE) that monitors the conduct of elections in the country.A two-judge Supreme Court Bench had, in its ruling dated October 12, 2018 in the case Kamal Nath Vs ECI and Others, held that it “finds force in the submission of ECI (that) Clause 11.2.2.2 of the election manual only uses the expression “text mode”. As per the clause, the draft roll must be put on the concerned chief electoral officer’s (CEO’s) website in a text mode and no photographs shall appear against the elector’s details.The Bench explained that a draft roll in text mode was already supplied to the petitioner ahead of the 2018 polls in Madhya Pradesh. Clause 11.2.2.2 “nowhere says that the draft electoral roll has to be put up on the CEO’s website in a ‘searchable PDF’.Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim, as a right, that the draft electoral roll should be placed on the website in a ‘searchable mode’. It has only to be in ‘text mode’ and it is so provided,” ruled the SC Bench comprising Justice A K Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan. It also cited “issues of privacy of voters” as EC’s reasons for not providing the draft electoral roll in a searchable PDF format.“ECI has directed its field level functionaries to put only the ‘Image PDF’ of electoral roll in the public domain. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the format in which the draft electoral roll is supplied to the petitioner fulfils the requirement contained in the election manual....If the petitioner so wants, he can always convert it into searchable mode which, of course, would require him to put his own efforts,” the Bench stated.EC officials on Thursday cited this 2018 verdict to underline that the Congress’s demand for “searchable or machine-readable rolls” is not new and forms part of its strategy for well over eight years, a fact that appears to have been selectively obscured in the present representation.“The demand reiterated by Gandhi, albeit consistent with the position historically maintained by the Congress, is not tenable within the contours of the prevailing legal framework...this very issue has already been agitated by the Congress party before the highest court of the country,” said an EC functionary“It appears that Gandhi may not have been appropriately apprised of the finality with which the matter stands concluded in judicial record,” the functionary noted.","A similar prayer made by senior Congress leader Kamal Nath before the Supreme Court was rejected way back in 2018.

What should students take away from these rankings?

The question matters now more than ever, as students across the globe weigh their future amid rising tuition fees, stricter immigration policies, and an increasingly competitive job market.Not everyone is lucky enough to be born in a country with a world-class education system and for millions of students, especially in developing nations, studying abroad is more than a dream; it’s a lifeline to opportunity, independence, and personal growth.According to the latest 2024 CEOWorld global education rankings, here are the top 10 countries that are acing the education game, based on two key indices: Quality and Opportunity.Home to Oxford, Cambridge, and a long tradition of academic excellence, the UK tops the 2024 rankings. With a robust public education system, global research powerhouses, and generous scholarship opportunities, it’s no surprise the UK continues to attract students from over 200 countries.According to the UK's Department for Education, the country ranks second globally in academic citations. Faculty credentials across Russell Group universities are among the highest in Europe and QS consistently ranks multiple UK institutions in the top 10 worldwide.The UK Parliament’s education review confirms that over 5% of GDP is allocated to education. With a 99% literacy rate and inclusive higher education access, the UK continues to offer opportunities for both domestic and international learners.The US holds its ground at #2, thanks to its unrivaled higher education ecosystem, which includes Ivy League institutions, STEM innovation, and expansive endowments. Despite its high cost, the US remains a top choice due to its research output and career-building opportunities post-graduation.According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the US leads the world in Nobel laureates, academic research funding, and publications. Seven of the world’s top 10 universities are located here.The Council for Higher Education Accreditation notes the US has over 4,000 accredited colleges. A 99% youth literacy rate, coupled with strong federal aid programs, ensures higher education access despite rising costs.Australia punches above its weight with eight universities in the global top 100. Its vibrant international student culture, generous post-study work rights, and strong linkages to industry make it a preferred destination in the Asia-Pacific region.According to the Australian Department of Education, universities here are heavily research-oriented and backed by industry partnerships, especially in climate science, medicine, and tech.The department also reports that nearly 6% of GDP is dedicated to education. With a literacy rate of 96%, the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system also provides vocational routes to higher education, expanding access across socioeconomic lines.With a wide range of English-taught programs and a progressive education model, the Netherlands has emerged as a European education hub. It balances academic freedom with strong employability prospects, particularly in design, engineering, and sustainability studies.The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science reports that Dutch universities are globally ranked and focus on interdisciplinary research in fields like sustainability, water management, and social innovation.With a 99% literacy rate and nearly 5.3% of GDP invested in education, according to Eurostat, Dutch institutions boast high postgraduate completion rates and a focus on employability.Sweden’s education model is built around innovation, student welfare, and gender equity.

English-medium programs and scholarship options have expanded for international students.Denmark’s approach to education emphasises collaborative learning, social equity, and creativity.

Denmark spends around 6.3% of GDP on education.Known for safety, inclusivity, and multicultural campuses, Canada continues to be a top destination for Indian and Asian students. Strong university-industry linkages and favourable immigration pathways make it a pragmatic choice for long-term settlement.Universities Canada and QS report that Canadian institutions rank consistently in the global top 150 and offer applied programs in AI, healthcare, and sustainability.According to Statistics Canada, with a 99% literacy rate and 5.9% of GDP dedicated to education, Canada provides a strong support system and career prospects for international students.Zero or low tuition in public universities, a strong emphasis on engineering and applied sciences, and robust technical education pathways help Germany stand out in the global education landscape.According to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, institutions like those in the TU9 alliance are global leaders in engineering and applied sciences.Germany maintains a 99% literacy rate and robust dual education models, merging classroom and workplace learning.

While rankings alone shouldn’t determine where to study, they do provide an important starting point for evaluating return on investment, academic quality, and career prospects.While countries like the UK, US, and Australia remain dominant due to their reputation and infrastructure, emerging destinations such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden offer an excellent balance of affordability, innovation, and inclusivity.Ultimately, the best education system is one that aligns with your goals, supports your career aspirations, and offers an environment where you can thrive academically and personally.Choose wisely, not just where education is best rated but where it best fits you.","The CEOWorld rankings reveal the top 10 countries with the best education systems, based on quality and opportunity.

SCO Summit: India nixes Pakistan-China bid to push their line on terror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-summit-india-nixes-pakistan-china-bid-to-push-their-line-on-terror/articleshow/122100074.cms,"High Drama At SCO; Rajnath Refuses To Sign Document Sans Pahalgam | China Bails Out Pak?

NEW DELHI: Finding Pakistan teaming up with China to push its line on terrorism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers' meet at Qingdao, India Thursday refused to sign the proposed joint statement as it would've diluted its consistent stand on the scourge endangering regional peace and stability.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as defence minister Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.Also read: ‘Proposal objected by one particular country,’ MEA on why Rajnath Singh refused to sign SCO statement There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it, sources told TOI.Pakistan was especially keen to include Jaffar Express hijacking in its restive Balochistan province in March in the joint document. Pakistan frequently accuses India of fomenting the ongoing insurgency for greater autonomy and independence in Balochistan.India, on its part, has consistently rejected all such ""baseless"" allegations.""The Indian delegation led by Rajnath Singh had serious objections to the draft joint statement and its language, which reeked of double standards in dealing with a serious issue like terrorism,"" a source said. External affairs ministry spokesperson said, ""India wanted its concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country (Pakistan) and, thus, the statement was not adopted. ""Both India and Pakistan in 2017 became full members of SCO, which also includes Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Belarus.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of UN designated terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) based in Pakistan, carried out the heinous attack in Pahalgam on April 22, in which 26 civilians were shot dead after being profiled on the basis of religious identity. ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further crossborder terrorist attacks, India on May 7 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross-border terrorist infrastructure,"" Singh said.India's zero tolerance for terrorism was manifested through its actions, he said. ""This includes our right to defend ourselves against terrorism. We have shown that epicentres of terrorism are no longer safe... India reaffirms its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.","Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.

Is college degree still a smart choice? Nikhil Kamath raises 5 big questions for students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/is-college-degree-still-a-smart-choice-nikhil-kamath-raises-5-big-questions-for-students/articleshow/122084328.cms,"students must rethink how they prepare for the future.



Are four-year college degrees still a reliable investment?



Are you preparing for the jobs that are actually growing?

Is your current education building the skills employers value most?

Are you ready to learn throughout your life?

Do you have the mindset to adapt when your industry changes?

In a recent X post, Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath challenged one of the most deeply held beliefs about education. Referring to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025, he wrote, “The days of 4-year college courses are over. Lifelong learning is the new norm.”It is a statement that reflects the changing pulse of the global job market. As industries undergo digital transformation and automation reshapes traditional roles, Kamath’s message is clear:Here are five important questions every student should ask, based entirely on the data and insights Kamath shared.Kamath’s post invites students to reflect on the real value of a degree in today’s world. College fees are rising but the certainty they once promised is slowly eroding. The WEF report, which Kamath refers to, outlines that nearly 39% of core skills are expected to change significantly by 2030.Traditional degrees may not keep pace with such rapid shifts. For students entering college now, the real question is not whether a degree is helpful but whether it is future-ready. If your course is not aligned with tomorrow’s needs, the return on your academic investment may fall short.Kamath draws attention to the WEF's identification of emerging job categories. Fields such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, big data, and green technology are expected to see major expansion. So are care-related roles like nursing, therapy, and counselling.In contrast, many clerical and support roles that were once considered stable are going to face a steady decline. Choosing a course without aligning it with actual job market growth trends may leave you underprepared, regardless of how prestigious the institution is.According to the WEF Report, analytical thinking is the top core skill employers are prioritising across industries. It is followed closely by attributes like creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and technological literacy. However, when it comes to specialised technical capabilities, AI and big data top the list as the most in-demand skills that employers are actively seeking and investing in.This raises a crucial question for students. Is your current academic program equipping you with both foundational thinking skills and exposure to cutting-edge tools like AI, machine learning, or data analytics? If not, it may be time to expand your learning through practical projects, industry certifications or digital tools that reflect where real job growth is happening.Kamath’s most pressing message is that lifelong learning is no longer optional. It is now central to staying relevant. Technologies and tools are evolving faster than most institutions can update their syllabi. Even after landing a job, professionals are expected to upskill, reskill, and sometimes pivot completely.For students, this means building the habit of self-directed learning early on. Short-term courses, online certifications, and hands-on training will likely become a regular part of your career path. A degree may open the first door but it is continuous learning that will keep you moving forward.According to the WEF, 92 million existing job roles are expected to be displaced by 2030, while 170 million new jobs will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs over the next five years. This reflects a job market in active transformation rather than decline.Kamath is essentially asking students whether they are preparing for disruption or simply hoping to avoid it. The willingness to learn new tools, take on new challenges, and build cross-disciplinary knowledge may matter more than your CGPA. Being adaptable could turn out to be your strongest asset.Nikhil Kamath is not saying that college has no place. What he is questioning is the blind faith placed in a system that may no longer guarantee the outcomes it once did. A college degree can still offer structure, credibility, and community but it is no longer the finish line.In today’s world, success is shaped by what you keep learning, not just what you once studied. Before choosing your degree, or continuing with one, take a moment to ask the questions that matter. Your future may depend on the answers.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath challenged one of the most deeply held beliefs about education. He wrote, “The days of 4-year college courses are over. Lifelong learning is the new norm” Kamath draws attention to the WEF's identification of emerging job categories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122084730,imgsize-65286,width-400,resizemode-4/122084730.jpg"

During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu. In January 2011, he was handed a jail term of 32 years.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia was sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan.

The fertility centre had refused to release it to her.The woman's son had chosen to preserve his semen during chemotherapy. Justice Manish Pitale said if the semen sample is destroyed before the matter is decided, the purpose of the petition would be ""frustrated"".The mother's petition said when her son was diagnosed with cancer, the oncologist treating him had advised him to freeze his semen as chemotherapy caused fertility problems.Her son, without consulting family members, however, ticked an option to destroy the sample in the event of his death. He passed away on Feb 16 intestate.On Feb 24 and 26, emails were sent by the woman to Nova IVF Fertility Centre requesting them not to dispose of the semen sample and to provide access to transfer the sample to a Gujarat-based IVF centre for future course of action. On Feb 27, Nova declined to release the sample and asked the mother to obtain authorisation from court as per Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act and Rules.On April 1, the Maharashtra public health secretary wrote asking her to approach the national board. On May 6, the Union ministry of health and family welfare rejected her request. Thereafter, the mother moved HC. The sample was meant for storage till July 31.Her petition, submitted through advocates Nikhilesh Pote and Tanmay Jadhav, said the young man's family comprises only female relatives. His father died at 45 and his uncle at 21. ""Now the petitioner has lost S at a young age of 21...the petitioner intends to continue the family legacy through the deceased son's semen.""It said when her son was in a critical state and realised he did not have much time, he told his aunt to ""do something with the sperm and create his children who would take care of my mom and family"". Also, it is a settled legal position that ""sperm constitutes property and the parents are the legal heirs of the deceased son.""It said the form signed by the deceased youth had two columns - to 'perish' the sample or hand it over to the wife (if married). ""The deceased son of the petitioner was unmarried, hence he might have chosen the 'perish' option.""

In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six year old son, Kiash, fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu.

As he stepped out of his three room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag...

His wife and son were away to attend a wedding in a nearby village in West Bengal.""Savita rushed inside briefly to wake up the others. I also went in and asked the girls to run to the other side of the room,"" Puran said.""Soon, the tiger jumped into another room through a window that had no grille and stood there. I then asked the girls to run out of the house. As soon as we escaped, we locked the iron door from outside and called for help,"" Puran added.The big cat may have sneaked into the house early in the morning when Puran had gone to the courtyard leaving the door open. Instances of leopards and other wild animals straying into houses had earlier been reported in Jharkhand, but it was the first time that a tiger had strayed into someone's house.The news sent district authorities into a tizzy, and the forest department rushed a team to control the situation.

A toy swan called Joy.But it's not just a toy. It has its roots in traditions of the scientific world. The practice of taking a toy into space to signal the onset of weightlessness started with Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, and has since evolved into a longstanding tradition in space missions.Joy is a zero gravity indicator aboard the Axiom-4 mission. It was chosen by the astronauts as a tribute to astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla ’s son Kiash, who has a deep affection for animals.""We are here, not just the four of us, we also have with us our Zero-G indicator - Joy - that started to float with us just when we were injected into orbit. Joy is floating all over the capsule, sometimes we have to find him/ her here with us,"" Polish astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski said.Joy, the baby swan, represents the collective ambition of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ), the European Space Agency (ESA), and Hungary's HUNOR space program to reach beyond Earth, Axiom Space said in a statement.""In this way, Joy represents cultural unity as three nations realize the return to human spaceflight, together as one crew,"" it said.""By choosing a swan as the zero-g indicator, the Ax-4 crew celebrates the diversity of their cultures, united in the shared human experience of space exploration,"" Axiom Space said.Talking about the symbolism behind the swan, Shukla said, ""This means a lot more than just a ZeroG indicator. I think we all have symbolism, in Poland and Hungary and India as well.""In India, the swan is seen as a symbol of wisdom and purity, reflecting the quest for truth. In Poland, it represents qualities like purity, loyalty, and resilience. Meanwhile, in Hungary, the swan embodies loyalty, elegance, and the natural beauty of the world.",Joy is a zero gravity indicator aboard the Axiom-4 mission.

Before that, he was in the TDP (Telugu Desam Party), and before that, he was in the RSS and the BJP. After becoming chief minister, he officially stated that doing labour is in the DNA of Biharis. Biharis are born to do labour work. Why did he say this? Because most of his rival KCR's officers had a Bihar background. So he was implying that Telangana is in a bad state because Biharis are running it. And to justify that, he added another statement saying it's in Biharis' DNA to do labour, and that's why KCR appointed them as bureaucrats,"" Kishor said.(You say Biharis are born to do labour work, and then come here and preach to us?)"" he told ANI in an interview.Recalling an unfulfilled promise from decades ago, Kishor also invoked former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1989 commitment to turn Bihar into a development hub.“Where did that money go? Congress remained in power afterwards, so tell us, what did you do for Bihar?” he asked.He further demanded that Rahul Gandhi issue an apology for what he called the “historic injustice” inflicted upon Biharis by the Congress.""If Congress apologised for the injustice done to Sikhs, then Rahul Gandhi should apologise to Biharis as well before campaigning in Bihar. If Biharis are only born for labour, then why are you coming here? Just go campaign in Telangana and get your votes there,"" Kishor said.Taking a dig at Congress’s electoral relevance in the state, Kishor said its future in Bihar rests entirely on “Lalu ji’s charity”.""Congress has no real existence in Bihar. For the past 25-30 years, it's been a party that just carries Lalu ji's bag. If Rahul Gandhi truly has political strength, let him contest elections in Bihar on his own. Try demanding 40 per cent of the seats from Lalu ji and see what happens. In Bihar, Congress dances to Lalu ji's tune. Whatever he decides, that's what happens,"" he said.The Bihar assembly elections are expected to be held in October or November this year, though the Election Commission of India is yet to announce the official dates.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), will look to retain power.On the other side, the Opposition’s INDIA bloc, consisting of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and the Left parties, aims to unseat CM Nitish Kumar.Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party is positioning itself as a third alternative, aiming to disrupt the traditional bipolar contest in the state.In the current 243-member Bihar assembly, the NDA holds a majority with 131 seats -- BJP has 80 MLAs, JD(U) 45, HAM(S) 4, and support from two Independents. The INDIA bloc has a strength of 111, led by the RJD with 77 MLAs, Congress with 19, and the Left parties accounting for the rest.","Bihar braces for high-stakes assembly election later this year.

SC alarmed by Karnataka HC's retro use of 'grounds of arrest' order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-alarmed-by-karnataka-hcs-retro-use-of-grounds-of-arrest-order/articleshow/122100746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes as it found that Karnataka high court had released a murder accused two years after his arrest as police had not informed him in writing the grounds of arrest as mandated by SC in Oct 2023.Appearing for Karnataka govt, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra told a bench led by Justice K V Viswanathan that SC rulings operate prospectively unless specifically directed for its retrospective application. He said the man was arrested on Feb 17, 2023, and was remanded to custody the same day in a murder case . The chargesheet has been filed and he is facing trial, Luthra said.However, nearly one-and-a-half years after SC in Pankaj Bansal case ruled on Oct 3, 2023 that investigating agencies must communicate in writing the grounds of arrest to the person being taken into custody, the murder accused moved Karnataka HC on March 22 this year questioning his arrest due to non-communication of the grounds of arrest in writing by relying on the SC ruling.Relying on subsequent rulings of SC reiterating the principle enunciated in Pankaj Bansal case, HC quashed his arrest but asked him to appear before the investigating officer, cooperate in the probe, not to threaten or tamper with witnesses, not to get involved in similar offences and not to leave the territory of the police station of Arsikere town without IO's permission.Justice Viswanathan said this could have a huge repercussion on thousands of arrests by police across states prior to pronouncement of the judgment in Pankaj Bansal case.""We are worried such a course of action, as adopted by Karnataka HC, will have a nation-wide implication and thousands of accused, arrested prior to Oct 3, 2023, may rush to courts seeking annulment of their arrests,"" he said.The bench noted that a similar question was pending judgment before a bench led by CJI B R Gavai, which had reserved verdict two months ago on April 22 on a petition filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah who had challenged his arrest alleging that the grounds of arrest were not communicated to him in writing by police.CJI Gavai and Justice A G Masih had raised two questions: Whether in every IPC case, it is mandatory to furnish grounds of arrest before or immediately after the arrest. And, whether the mandate could be optional in exceptional cases where it is impossible to provide grounds of arrest immediately on arrest.Referring to Mihir Shah's case, Justice Viswanathan said since the judgment could be expected after July 15 and could lay down guidelines regarding communication of grounds of arrest, it would be better to post the Karnataka case for hearing on July 18.Justice Viswanathan's apprehension was fully reflected in CJI Gavai's views, as before reserving verdict in Mihir Shah's case, he had observed, ""Imagine someone is shooting people in public. Should police take him into custody or wait to prepare grounds of arrest to be served on him prior to that? Our judgments (making it mandatory for police to furnish grounds of arrest in writing) have been grossly misused.""",Supreme Court realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes. Karnataka high court had released a murder accused two years after his arrest as police had not informed him in writing the grounds of arrest as mandated by SC in Oct 2023.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122101056,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/122101056.jpg"

'Garbage Of Lies': Mamata's Scathing Attack At Modi's 'Nirmam' Swipe, Dares To 'Hold Elections'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of acting as a ""stooge of the BJP"" and making a “backdoor attempt to implement the NRC” under the guise of a special revision of electoral rolls.""This looks to be more dangerous than the NRC,"" she warned, calling on all opposition parties to resist what she described as a ""dangerous game"" threatening India’s democracy.Addressing a press conference from Digha in East Medinipur, where she’s overseeing preparations for Friday’s Rath Yatra, the TMC supremo said she had received two lengthy letters from the ECI containing new rules targeting voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004.""I have received two letters from the ECI, each comprising 25-30 pages. I haven't been able to go through them in detail so far. But from what I have understood from a cursory glance, the Commission is now seeking a declaration form from voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, which is Annexure D in one of the letters, where they will have to submit birth certificates of both parents as proof of citizenship,"" she said, according to news agency PTI.""I don't understand the reason behind the ECI move or the rationale behind selecting these dates. This is nothing short of a scam. I seek clarification from the Commission on whether they are trying to implement the NRC through backdoors. In fact, this looks to be more dangerous than the NRC, which every political party in opposition must resist,"" Banerjee added.She futher claimed the BJP’s real target was Bengal, not Bihar, where assembly elections are due later this year.“Nothing will happen in Bihar because the BJP rules that state… They want to delete the names of valid young voters. Many parents will not be able to furnish their birth certificates,” she said, alleging that migrant workers, students, villagers, and uneducated voters were being selectively targeted.Banerjee also accused the ECI of bypassing political parties and serving the agenda of a “certain RSS pracharak” running the country -- an indirect reference to Union home minister Amit Shah.""How can the ECI do this unilaterally without consulting the recognised political parties at the central and state levels who play a key role in running the country's democratic structure? They are treating us like bonded laborers and doing this only to fulfil the wishes of a certain RSS pracharak who is now running the country for all practical purposes,"" she said.Citing an earlier ECI letter asking for details of TMC booth level agents, she asked: ""Why should I reveal the names of my booth agents? So that the BJP can purchase them?""The West Bengal CM alleged that the BJP, with ECI’s support, was trying to enlist outsiders in Bengal's voter rolls while deleting genuine voters.“We ask the poll panel not to pressurise common people to accept their verdict. My humble request to the EC is that it should act impartially like it is expected to,” she said.Calling on opposition parties across India to take note, Banerjee said, “This ploy is now clear as daylight. We are the first to respond. But I urge the other opposition parties to take serious note of this and build resistance.”""Citizens should keep a keen eye on their status in electoral roles till the very end. Else they might find their names struck off and sent to detention camps. That's the intention of the BJP,"" she said, adding, ""our party will build up people's resistance against this and we will soon hit the streets.”","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accuses Election Commission of India of acting as a ""stooge of the BJP"" The TMC supremo said she had received two lengthy letters from the ECI containing new rules targeting voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004.

Ax-4 will give Shukla an opportunity to experience life in an orbital station.During the 14-day ISS mission, Shukla will carry out seven India-led experiments, including research on seeds, algae and human physiology in microgravity, besides five experiments with Nasa. He will also get familiar with various crew systems aboard the ISS, gaining critical knowledge of how the station operates 400km above Earth.Once back, Shukla will share his learning with other Gaganyaan astronaut-designates. While the final crew for Gaganyaan is yet to be selected - two or three may be chosen - Shukla, armed with experience, is seen as a frontrunner.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla's experiments will help advance space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems for long-duration missions.One study involves understanding how space radiation affects edible microalgae - a promising food source for astronauts.Another experiment examines cyanobacteria like Spirulina and Synechococcus in microgravity, assessing their growth using nitrogen sources, including urea from human waste, to support recycling-based life systems. The experiments will use indigenously-developed biotech kits designed for microgravity. The effort will nurture a space biology ecosystem in India.Shukla will also interact with PM Modi, students, and industry leaders during the mission, showcasing India's growing capabilities in space.","Shubhanshu Shukla will carry out seven India-led experiments, including research on seeds, algae and human physiology in microgravity.

India takes tough stand on terrorism

Doval trip

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday met his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun in Qingdao and delivered a strong message on the future of bilateral ties between the two nations.The ministers held talks on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers' meeting.""Held talks with Admiral Dong Jun, the Defence Minister of China, on the sidelines of the SCO Defence Ministers' Meeting in Qingdao. We had a constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on issues about bilateral relations,"" Singh said in a social media post on Friday.Singh's visit to Qingdao coincided with the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in Tibet.It is taking place after a gap of nearly five years. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra was suspended initially in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequently because of the military standoff between the two sides on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.""Expressed my happiness on the restarting of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra after a gap of nearly six years,"" said Singh.""It is incumbent on both sides to maintain this positive momentum and avoid adding new complexities in the bilateral relationship,"" he added.Singh's visit to China came amid efforts by both New Delhi and Beijing to reset their ties following an understanding last October to end the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The defence minister also presented a Madhubani painting from Bihar to his Chinese counterpart.This traditional art form, also known as Mithila painting, originates in Bihar’s Mithila region. It is characterised by intricate line drawings filled with bright colours, patterns, and tribal motifs. These paintings are popular for their vivid earthy tones and distinctive designs.Singh's statement comes a day after India took a firm stand at the SCO meeting by refusing to sign a joint statement that would have diluted India's position on critical issues, particularly concerning terrorism and regional security.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""On June 23, National Security Advisor Ajit Dovfal held a meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing and reviewed recent developments in India-China relations and underscored the need to promote the overall development of the bilateral ties, including by fostering greater people-to-people ties.During the meeting, NSA Doval emphasised the need to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations to maintain peace and stability in the region.

He caught the launch. He was excited to watch what appeared like a Sun against a black backdrop,” Kamna recalled.The mission, a milestone for private spaceflight and a landmark for India’s human spaceflight journey, saw “Grace” — the Dragon capsule carrying Shukla and three international crewmates — dock successfully with the ISS.Kamna, who by then had reached Atlanta where her brother lives, was elated. “This is India’s time in space. Shux, me, and our entire family are looking forward to Gaganyaan , and the future of India’s human spaceflight programme,” she said.Though the family had their share of nerves when the mission was postponed multiple times, Kamna said there was “never any doubt that everything would be taken care of”.Now that Shukla is aboard the ISS, the family is scheduled to have two private video calls with him during his stay. “Those have been pre-arranged. But he can also call us whenever he’s free and it’s feasible,” Kamna said.As Shukla conducts cutting-edge Indian scientific experiments in orbit it is not just his mission, but a national moment. And behind the calm professionalism of an IAF pilot-turned-astronaut is a family that has been quietly sharing the journey every step of the way.In an exclusive interview to TOI earlier, Kamna had described Shux as the bravest person she knows and said she was confident that he’ll perform his duty as he always has.Ahead of launch Shukla had said: “No one travels to space alone… we do so on the shoulders of so many more. I feel grateful to each and every one of you. Thank you…” He had specially thanked his wife Kamna for being the wonderful partner that she was, and said: “Without you none of this was possible but more importantly none of this would matter.”",Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station.

Shiv Sena MP's driver gets Rs 150 crore land as 'gift' from Salar Jung kin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shiv-sena-mps-driver-gets-rs-150-crore-land-as-gift-from-salar-jung-kin/articleshow/122101820.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: A mysterious gift deed transferring ownership of a three-acre parcel of land in Maharashtra, valued at around Rs 150 crore, from descendants of Hyderabad's famous Salar Jung family to Shiv Sena MP Sandipanrao Bhumre's driver has triggered more than just incredulous surprise at his sudden turn of fortune.The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Police is investigating how Jawed Rasul Shaikh, who has been driving around the MP and his MLA son Vilas Bhumre for 13 years, is linked to the estate of the erstwhile Diwan of Hyderabad, Salar Jung.Jawed told TOI that he was cooperating with the inquiry and had already submitted the details investigators had asked for. ""I share good relations with the descendants of the Salar Jung family, so they gifted the land to me,"" he said.Police commissioner Pravin Pawar said Thursday that Jawed was summoned based on a complaint by a lawyer from Parbhani, flagging the ""hibanama"" (gift deed) in his name for what is regarded as ""prime land"" at Dawoodpura along Jalna Road in Sambhajinagar.""We will scan Jawed's income tax returns and details of any other source of income. He needs to explain why anyone from the Salar Jung family would make a gift deed in his name, giving away three acres in a prime location,"" inspector Sambhaji Pawar, part of the EOW team probing the land transfer, told TOI.Members of the Salar Jung family who signed the deed - Mir Mazhar Ali Khan and six of his relatives - are still to respond to EOW's notice to have their statements recorded, the officer said.Vilas, who represents Paithan constituency, protested against police allegedly dragging him and his father into the controversy over a land transfer deed in Jawed's name. ""EOW officials questioned me, too. Although Jawed is our driver, we don't have control over everything he does. In any case, hibanama is a legally valid process of gifting assets,"" he said.Several members of the Salar Jung family served as prime ministers to the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad.The gift deed executed by Mazhar Ali and six others states that they received their share of three out of 12 acres belonging to the clan at Bagsherganj in Dawoodpura after a prolonged litigation lasting till Jan 30, 2023. Police have found out that the gift deed in favour of Jawed was executed around the same time.Lawyer Mujahid Khan, whose complaint led EOW to initiate the probe, said his curiosity was piqued by the fact that Jawed wasn't even remotely related to the Salar Jung clan.""Why would the descendants of Salar Jung from Hyderabad give a gift deed to a person working as a driver in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and that too after winning a legal battle for the same property. Also, a hibanama is legally valid only between blood relatives. The Salar Jung descendants and the driver are not only unrelated, they belong to two different sects of Islam.""Repeated calls to numbers belonging to members of the Salar Jung family went unanswered.","Jawed Rasul Shaikh is Shiv Sena MP Sandipanrao Bhumre's driver.

Nepal ambassador says issued advisory after scores of Nepalese youths rescued from captivity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-envoy-says-advisory-issued-after-nepalese-youths-rescued-from-captivity/articleshow/122100749.cms,"Nepal ambassador says issued advisory after scores of Nepalese youths rescued from captivity

DEHRADUN: Close to 60 men from Nepal have in recent days been rescued from months-long captivity by teams comprising officials in India, staff from the Nepal embassy and NGO workers after the youth — many of them minors — were trafficked into UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar by shady job networks. Those in the know say there could be “at least a thousand others”.??Nepal’s ambassador to India, Shankar P Sharma, told TOI on Thursday: “Kathmandu has issued an advisory to citizens to be cautious before taking job offers in India. We have received full cooperation from Indian agencies in the rescue of our citizens.” His remarks came amid widening investigations in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, where similar rackets are suspected to be operating with impunity.Echoing the state’s stance, Uttarakhand home secretary Shailesh Bagauli told TOI, “Uttarakhand govt has always offered full cooperation to neighbouring countries like Nepal in such cases, and will continue to do so. We will take all necessary actions to ensure that such crimes are not committed in our state in future.”In the past week alone, 57 Nepalese nationals — 12 of them minors — were rescued from two towns in Uttarakhand.They had been confined in ordinary-looking homes in Rudrapur and Kashipur by a syndicate that police say operates under the guise of a marketing firm. The youths had been lured with promises of jobs as packaging agents or accountants, then confined, beaten and forced to recruit others into the same racket.Last Thursday, a dark staircase led Uttarakhand police into a three-room house tucked in a narrow, squalid alley in Kashipur. The first thing officers noticed was the silence. Inside, 35 young men sat on the floor with blank eyes and rigid shoulders. The windows were shut, the curtains drawn with bedsheets. The room smelled faintly of sweat and starch. Plastic plates with dried rice clung to the corners of the floor. None of the men spoke until a plainclothes officer touched one on the shoulder and said, in Nepali, “You are safe now.” One of them began to cry. The rest soon followed.The rescues were carried out by Uttarakhand police in collaboration with the Nepal embassy and KIN India, a group of Nepalese social workers based in Delhi who work on cases related to human trafficking. The chain of events had begun when one young man escaped captivity in Kashipur and alerted police in Nepal. He was later brought back across the border by KIN India to retrace his steps. What he revealed was a tightly managed operation where dozens of young men, stripped of phones and freedom, were being used as bait to pull in more victims.Four days later, on June 23, police found 22 more in a similar facility in Rudrapur, nine of them underage. Another 32 were discovered in Kashipur. Three men —Birendra Shahi, Sachin Kumar and Manish Tiwari — were arrested, and more are being investigated.“They had to hand over names and numbers — dozens of them. Friends, cousins, neighbours,” said Naveen Joshi, KIN India’s rescue and repatriation officer. “If they refused, they were beaten. It was systematic, coercive recruitment.”Anuj Kotwal, 18, a rescued youth from Sunsari, described the conditions inside. “A friend called me — he was already trapped but couldn’t tell me. I paid Rs 15,000 for what they called a processing fee. Once here, we were fed rice with water and turmeric, maybe salt. Potatoes were rare. We slept on floors and were told not to speak.” Anuj said he still hears the sound of the lock turning in his sleep.Rajesh, 19, from Dharan, had worked as a mason. He took the offer to support his newborn daughter. “They kept me locked for seven months. They beat me. They made me call my friends and lie to them. I thought I’d never go home.”Joshi said a syndicate was operating in India with a structure similar to cyberfraud compounds in Southeast Asia. “It resembles the Myanmar and Cambodia models run by Chinese groups,” he said. “This isn’t just trafficking—it’s industrialised fraud.”The rescued men were later escorted back to Nepal through the Gaddachauki border post. The Nepal embassy said it is working with Indian officials to ensure safe repatriation and further identify victims. Independent studies and UNODC data estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Nepalese have been trafficked into India over the past decade, often under the pretext of employment.US Nagar SSP Manikant Mishra, who supervised the rescue, said, “A case has been registered under BNS sections for organised crime, wrongful confinement, kidnapping and conspiracy. Three individuals, including a Nepal citizen, have been arrested so far. The investigation is ongoing.”","Nepal ambassador says Kathmandu has issued advisory to citizens to be cautious before taking job offers in India.

Govt to cut by half toll rates for highways with more than 50% structures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-cut-by-half-toll-rates-for-highways-with-more-than-50-structures/articleshow/122098900.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a decision that will benefit users of highways and bypasses that have structures — flyovers, underpasses and tunnels – accounting for more than 50% of their length, the toll rate for such stretches (with structures) will be halved and capped at five times the normal toll. Till now, the toll for stretches with structures was 10 times the normal toll.The road transport ministry has given the go-ahead for the change, which will be notified in the next couple of days. The new norm will bring relief to commuters using highway stretches linking two neighbouring cities, Ring roads and bypasses built by Central govt in urban areas, which usually have more such structures, as is the case with Dwarka Expressway in Delhi.As per current NH Fee Rules, the toll charge for every km of elevated stretch or tunnel is 10 times the user fee collected for a km of regular highway stretch. The formula is applied to recover the costs incurred to build elevated stretches and tunnels, which are more capital-intensive compared to regular highway sections.Citing an example, an official said a one-way car trip on the 28.5-km Dwarka Expressway having 21 km of structures will cost Rs 317 as per the present norm — Rs 306 for the structures portion and Rs 11 for the remaining 7 km -- but this will go down to around Rs 153, less than half, when the new norm is applied.While officials said that the change in rule may not have a huge impact on car users who opt for the Annual toll pass scheme for private cars that the govt will be implementing, it will benefit commercial and heavy vehicles.","Till now, the toll for stretches with structures was 10 times the normal toll.

"Space travel alters worldview, makes clear planet belongs to everyone: India's first spaceman Rakesh Sharma",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/space-travel-alters-worldview-makes-clear-planet-belongs-to-everyone-indias-first-spaceman-rakesh-sharma/articleshow/122098909.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla is in space as part of the Axiom-4 mission, India’s first spaceman Rakesh Sharma , who went there as part of the Indo-Soviet space programme in 1984, has said that space travel alters the mindset of humans and makes them see the world from a perspective that “this planet belongs to everyone” and is “not the sole preserve” of anyone.“We really need to preserve what we have, which means we need to end conflicts, we need to forget about our weapons, we need to forget about confrontation and we need to start collaborating instead,” he said in a recorded podcast shared by ministry of defence on the day India returned to space after 41 years.After more than a year-long training in the erstwhile USSR, Sharma, an IAF test pilot, was launched into space along with two Russian cosmonauts, where he spent over a week in orbit on the Salyut-7 space station in 1984. “Because I was a test pilot when the selection happened… that time I was young, I was fit, and I had the qualification, so I was lucky enough to have been chosen. Then, after selection, we moved to Star City, just outside Moscow, for our training. The training went on for 18 months and culminated in the Indo-Soviet spaceflight in 1984. It was an eight-day mission, and we carried out experiments which were designed by Indian scientists,"" he said.Sharma recalled that the entire training and communication with crew members and mission control while they were in orbit was in Russian. “We had to learn the language before we started training, and that was not easy because of the paucity of time. So, we took about two months to learn the language,” he said.He highlighted that in space, sunrises and sunsets happen at an interval of 45 minutes as “we moved around Earth in just 90 minutes”, and saw day and night several times in a day.In the podcast released on Wednesday night, the spaceman said that while space travel technology has changed, “as humans, we haven't changed much”. “The mental impact will always be there because humans will be able to get a different perspective. It does kind of alter the worldview... (shows) the vast place in the universe.” Sharma had famously said “Sare Jehan Se Acha...” when then PM Indira Gandhi asked him how India looked from space.Asked about the future of Indian space travel, he said, “We will be going farther and farther from planet Earth... Space tourism will happen but space exploration will go side by side and we will keep marching ahead”.On India’s uniqueness, Sharma said: “We shared our Vedas with everybody. Our heritage says ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The world is one family)’. We still value it in the modern world as during Covid epidemic, we shared (vaccines) with everybody...”.When asked how he found the world and India from space, Sharma exclaimed, “Oh dear! Beautiful. In our country, we got everything: we got a long coastline, the ghats section, plains, tropical forests, mountains, Himalayas. It's a beautiful sight, different colours, different textures”.After his return from the mission, Sharma went back to the IAF from where he retired as wing commander. “After a few years, I moved to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited as their chief test pilot,” he said, and recalled his association with the evolution of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’ fighter jet. “Later I joined the IT industry. Life has been rewarding for me.”","India's first spaceman Rakesh Sharma says space travel alters the mindset of humans.

"Tight security in place for Amarnath Yatra, pilgrims advised to move in convoys",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tight-security-in-place-for-amarnath-yatra-pilgrims-advised-to-move-in-convoys/articleshow/122098281.cms,"SRINAGAR: Acknowledging a dip in registrations for Amarnath Yatra following the Pahalgam terror attack , Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday assured full security for the yatra, which is set to begin on July 3, and appealed to devotees to participate in large numbers.At a press conference at Raj Bhawan, Sinha said there had been a 10.19% decline in pilgrim registrations compared to last year, attributing the drop to the Pahalgam massacre. He said before the attack, the pace of registration was encouraging, with around 2.36 lakh pilgrims signing up for the yatra, which concludes on Aug 9.The LG said the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB) had launched a re-verification programme for pilgrims who had registered before the April 22 Pahalgam attack. “So far 85,000 pilgrims have reconfirmed their registration after consultation with SASB,” he said, and hoped the numbers would go up in the coming days.Sinha unveiled the security plan, reassuring devotees about safety, and also gave the details of the upgraded infrastructure along the routes to ensure a smooth and safe pilgrimage.He said a multi-layered security grid had been put in place, with increased deployment of the Army, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and J&K Police.“Integrated command and control centres have been set up, and vulnerable spots have been identified for focused security measures,” he said. He advised the pilgrims to move in the designated convoys for safety reasons. Even those coming in their own vehicles were advised to move in convoys, he maintained.Several new initiatives had been introduced, including a comprehensive insurance scheme covering not just the yatris, but also ponywallas and other service providers, the LG said. However, helicopter service had been suspended this year due to recent chopper accidents and security concerns, he revealed. He added that this would not affect the overall flow of the yatra as only a small percentage of pilgrims used the helicopter service.Sinha said SASB had developed several pilgrim-centric amenities over the past two years, including widening of both the yatra routes to around 12ft along most stretches. Safer yatra tracks have been prepared with stronger safety handrails all along the Baltal track and over 20 km on vulnerable stretches on the Pahalgam track. He said the tracks and camps would have power connectivity till the holy cave and from there to Panjtarni.There will be enhanced accommodation for pilgrims at SASB’s Yatri Niwas complexes at Baltal (800), Nunwan (900) and Pantha chowk (1000). “Digital pre-paid systems for hiring of various services like pony, pithu and palki will be available for pilgrims,” he added.At the holy cave, the wooden darshan platform has been replaced with a stainless steel platform with wood flooring. “Now, pilgrims would be able to have darshans simultaneously in four rows. This shall facilitate better and hassle-free darshans,” he added.Responding to a query whether he will allow the elected govt to have a say in the yatra’s administrative affairs, the LG said he would be holding a separate meeting with chief minister Omar Abdullah to discuss the matter.He said people of Kashmir had always welcomed Amarnath yatris with warmth and unparalleled hospitality. “There is no alternative to the Kashmiri spirit of welcome. Let us continue this tradition and ensure the yatra is safe, peaceful and successful for all,” he added.","Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday assured full security for the yatra, which is set to begin on July 3.

NEW DELHI: The RSS on Thursday urged a review of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Constitution’s preamble, citing they were added during the Emergency and not included in the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar.RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabole was addressing an event marking 50 years of the Emergency and said, “Babasaheb Ambedkar never used these words in the preamble of the Constitution. The words were added during the Emergency, when fundamental rights were suspended, Parliament did not function, and the judiciary became lame.""He said that discussions were previously held on this issue, but no concrete outcome was achieved regarding the removal of these words. ""So whether they should remain in the preamble should be considered,” said Hosabole.Taking a jab at the Congress, Hosable demanded an apology for the excesses committed during the Emergency era which witnessed large-scale forced sterilisation, incarceration of people, and the curtailment of the freedom of judiciary and press, he recalled.""Those who did such things are today moving around with Constitution's copy.They have still not apologised... Apologise,"" he said.Earlier on Tuesday, union home minister Amit Shah had called the Emergency which was imposed on June 25, 1975, a “dark chapter” and said that the “nation never bows down to dictatorship”.

Dhankhar’s resignation sparks buzz: Opposition not on same page? Priyanka Chaturvedi ‘fact checks’ Jairam Ramesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhankhars-resignation-sparks-buzz-oppositionn-not-on-same-page-priyanka-chaturvedi-fact-checks-jairam-ramesh/articleshow/122826889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation late Monday has sparked a wave of speculation and political reactions. A notable disagreement has emerged within the opposition ranks regarding his tenure and abrupt exit. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi early Tuesday took aim at attempts to paint Dhankhar’s tenure as balanced, pushing back against Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s defence of the outgoing Rajya Sabha Chairman.Without naming Ramesh directly, Chaturvedi quoted the Congress general secretary's claim that he “took both the Government and the Opposition to task in equal measure” and dismissed it as false, reminding critics that the Opposition had once been compelled to bring a no-confidence motion against him.Ramesh, reacting to Dhankhar’s sudden resignation on Monday evening, described the move as “shocking” and “inexplicable”. He said, “Mr. Dhankar took both the Government and the Opposition to task in equal measure.”However, on early Tuesday, Chaturvedi quickly contradicted that claim with a sharp rebuttal on social media. “Fact check: Incorrect. Reminder: Opposition was forced to file a no confidence motion against the chair because of the partisan manner of conduct.Let’s at least not forget that, just because, the moment has come as a surprise,” she posted.Ramesh, meanwhile, has suggested that Dhankhar’s resignation involved more than just health concerns. In two detailed statements across Monday evening and Tuesday morning, Ramesh recounted events that he believed pointed to deeper tensions.He highlighted how Dhankhar had chaired the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) at 12:30 PM on Monday, where most members, including JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju, were present. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for 4:30 PM but both Nadda and Rijiju failed to attend without informing Dhankhar personally. “Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 PM,” Ramesh said.He added, “So something very serious happened yesterday between 1 PM and 4:30 PM to account for the deliberate absence.” While stating that the health reasons cited by Dhankhar must be respected, Ramesh noted, “It is also a fact that there are far deeper reasons for his resignation.”Ramesh praised Dhankhar for speaking up “fearlessly” on issues such as farmers’ welfare and judicial accountability and for trying, “to the extent possible under the current G2 ruling regime,” to accommodate the opposition. “Shri Jagdeep Dhankar’s resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of those who had got him elected as Vice President in the first instance,” he concluded.Dhankhar, 74, had undergone angioplasty recently and had served as Vice President since August 2022. His sudden exit came on the first day of the monsoon session, catching many in Parliament off guard.",Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation late Monday has sparked a wave of speculation and political reactions.

Jagdeep Dhankhar resigns as VP: What happened between 1 and 4.30pm? Congress points to 'deeper reasons' behind sudden exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jagdeep-dhankhar-resigns-as-vp-what-happened-between-1-and-4-30pm-congress-points-to-deeper-reasons-behind-sudden-exit/articleshow/122826192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday raised questions citing ""far deeper reasons"" over Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation, suggesting that a serious development between 1 PM and 4:30 PM on Monday may have triggered the decision.Jairam Ramesh’s comments came a day after Dhankhar stepped down, citing health reasons, hours after delivering an address in the Rajya Sabha flagging an impeachment motion against a judge and a incident involving unclaimed cash found in the House.Ramesh in a post on X, claimed that Dhankhar had chaired the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting of the Rajya Sabha at 12:30 PM on Monday, which was attended by several members, including Leader of the House JP Nadda and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju. The committee decided to reconvene at 4:30 PM the same day.“At 4:30 PM, the BAC reassembled under the chairmanship of Shri Jagdeep Dhankar. It waited for Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju to arrive. They never came. Shri Jagdeep Dhankar was not personally informed that the two senior Ministers were not attending. Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 PM,” Ramesh said.He added, “So something very serious happened yesterday between 1 PM and 4:30 PM to account for the deliberate absence of Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju.”Describing Dhankhar’s resignation as “unprecedented,” Ramesh said that while his stated reason of health must be respected, there were “far deeper reasons” behind the decision. He praised Dhankhar for speaking “fearlessly for the welfare of farmers,” criticising what he termed “ahankar” in public life, and for demanding judicial accountability.“He was a stickler for norms, proprieties, and protocol, which he believed were being consistently disregarded in both his capacities,” Ramesh said, adding, “Shri Jagdeep Dhankar's resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of those who had got him elected as Vice President in the first instance.”Dhankhar's resignation came shortly after he addressed the Rajya Sabha, confirming receipt of a motion seeking the removal of a high court judge. He also disclosed that a bundle of Rs 500 notes was found on a seat in the House, which no one had claimed — an incident he described as ""deeply concerning.""Earlier this month, addressing a gathering at Jawahar Lal University Dhankhar said, ""I will retire at the right time, August 2027, subject to divine intervention."" His departure has triggered a flurry of political reactions, with senior advocate and MP Kapil Sibal expressing personal sorrow over the development and recalling their longstanding camaraderie.Responding to Jairam Ramesh’s Monday remarks, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey took to X and said, “In films, Kader Khan used to play such roles — and now the Opposition is living out that character.”Dubey cited a Reuters report from December, which said, “Indian opposition parties moved on Tuesday to impeach Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, a spokesman said, accusing him of being partisan in his role as chairman of parliament's upper house, in a first such move in the country's history. Dhankhar's office did not respond to a request for comment.”He added, “They had just moved a proposal to remove him. At the very least, have some concern for the man’s health.”","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh raises questions citing ""far deeper reasons"" over Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation.

NEW DELHI: A British F35B fighter jet, grounded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram airport since June 14 due to a hydraulic system malfunction, is set to depart on Tuesday after successful repairs by a UK technical team including manufacturer representatives.The aircraft, which belongs to the UK navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, was forced to land at the city airport during a routine flight when it encountered technical problems preventing it from landing on the ship.The repair work took approximately one week to complete, with technicians addressing the issues in the jet's hydraulic system before clearing it for departure.The Royal Navy's stealth aircraft, operating with the Carrier Strike Group from HMS Prince of Wales, executed an emergency landing citing fuel concerns and unfavourable weather during standard operations. The IAF assisted in ensuring a secure landing and provided subsequent fuel and logistics assistance.A formal statement from the IAF confirmed their complete awareness of the situation and their assistance rendered for ""safety reasons"". Royal Navy technical personnel from the carrier group attempted repairs unsuccessfully.Officials from Britain acknowledged ongoing repair efforts whilst expressing gratitude to Indian authorities for their assistance.British authorities announced plans to transfer the F-35B stealth aircraft to the local MRO facility for necessary repairs.A specialist British team comprising 21 personnel, including aviation engineers, arrived at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The £85-million aircraft was subsequently relocated from the tarmac to a hangar.Airport officials confirmed that the sophisticated British F-35B fighter aircraft is scheduled to depart on July 22, following successful repairs, after more than a month's stay at the airport.","British F35B fighter jet grounded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram airport since June 14 due to a hydraulic system malfunction.

"Rapid test kits for Hepatitis B, Sickle cell anemia to be available at PHCs, government decides",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rapid-test-kits-for-hepatitis-b-sickle-cell-anemia-to-be-available-at-phcs-government-decides/articleshow/122825931.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big move to ensure timely detection of common diseases like Hepatitis B, sickle cell anemia and syphilis at primary level, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres. This includes the Ayushman Arogya Mandirs Sub-Centres and primary health centres.Sources said the move follows feedback received from national programs and other subject experts, who highlighted the growing importance of providing rapid diagnostic tools at primary health facilities for early detection and treatment.Many RDTs available in the market have not been included for the want of robust evidence. Officials said these tests can be reconsidered for inclusion in the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) once the required data is comprehensively assessed and verified, the officials said.The ICMR, which is the apex health research agency, released the NEDL in 2019 to set basic standards for availability of diagnostic facilities at health facilities in the country. Recently, it has been updated to include RDTs and other requirements.For example, the 2019 NEDL had kept certain diagnostic tests under the ""hub-and-spoke"" model at primary health centres (PHCs). A hub and spoke model in a laboratory setting is a healthcare delivery strategy where a central, well-equipped ""hub"" laboratory provides specialized diagnostic services, while smaller, less equipped ""spoke"" laboratories handle routine and less complex testing, with samples often transferred between the two.However, the updated equipment list which was released recently suggests these tests should be available at the PHCs itself. This will do away with the need for sample transfer to hubs thereby making it possible to diagnose and treat a wider array of conditions at the lower level, the ICMR says. The updated NEDL also addresses the issue of new nomenclature of healthcare facilities with Sub-Centres now referred to as Ayushman Arogya Mandirs.The revision of the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) was undertaken through extensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders. The process began with an open call on the ICMR website inviting suggestions on the existing Essential Diagnostics List. This was followed by four rounds of consultations to discuss the suggestions received with the relevant experts and stakeholders. Subsequently, the draft revised list was deliberated with representatives from State NHM and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The final list incorporated the feedback and recommendations received in all consultations, officials said.","The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres.

NEW DELHI: Vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned from his post on Monday evening, citing medical reasons. His decision has opened the field for the selection of a new vice-president.In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu , Dhankhar wrote: ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as vice-president of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution.""Dhankhar, 74, had taken office in August 2022.

His resignation came on the first day of the Monsoon session of Parliament.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which holds a majority in the vice-presidential electoral college comprising members of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, was taken by surprise by the move. The ruling alliance is expected to discuss possible candidates in the coming days.The BJP is likely to choose a nominee from a broad pool that includes current governors, senior leaders from the party organisation, or serving Union ministers.Before becoming vice-president, Dhankhar was the governor of West Bengal.Dhankhar’s predecessor, M Venkaiah Naidu, was a former BJP president and a cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government when the party selected him for the vice-president’s post in 2017.Dhankhar’s three-year tenure saw several confrontations with opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha.“We are still processing it. But I believe the party will choose someone who is a solid choice and is non-controversial,” a BJP leader was quoted as saying by the PTI.Among those being discussed as possible choices is Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh, a Janata Dal (United) MP who has held the post since 2020. He is viewed as someone who enjoys the government’s trust.Dhankhar is the third vice-president of India after V V Giri and R Venkataraman to resign during his tenure. Both Giri and Venkataraman had stepped down from the vice-president’s post to contest the presidential election.As per rules, the election to fill the vice-president's post must be held within the next six months.

The Andheri subway had to be closed due to severe waterlogging, causing further traffic snarls in the area.Motorists complained of slow traffic movement on both the Eastern Express Highway and the Western Express Highway due to rain and other reasons during the morning rush hours.Some commuters also complained that locals trains were running with a little delay.According to IMD officials, the rainfall is linked to a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, which has intensified rain activity along Maharashtra’s coastal belt, including Mumbai and surrounding regions.While no red alert has been issued for Mumbai, the IMD has urged residents—especially office-goers and commuters—to exercise caution, particularly in the evening hours when isolated heavy showers are expected.For the next 24 hours, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a generally cloudy sky with moderate spells of rain in Mumbai and suburbs, with the possibility of thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds at isolated places.After a high tide of 3.91 metres at 9.19 am, another one of 3.38 metres was expected at 8.37 pm.

Solar Eclipse in August 2027: Date and time



In Southern Spain, totality is expected to begin around 13:30 to 14:00 local time (CEST).

In North Africa, such as Libya and Egypt, the eclipse will peak around 14:00 to 14:30 local time (EET).

In Saudi Arabia, the eclipse will reach totality slightly later in the day, around 15:00 local time (AST).

What makes the 2027 solar eclipse so special



Earth at Aphelion: On August 2, Earth will be at its farthest point from the Sun. This makes the Sun appear slightly smaller in the sky.

Moon at Perigee: At the same time, the Moon will be at its closest distance to Earth, making it look larger than usual.

Equatorial Shadow Path: The eclipse will travel close to the equator, where the Earth's rotational speed causes the Moon’s shadow to move more slowly across the surface. This slower movement prolongs the duration of totality.

Solar Eclipse 2027 visibility



Europe



Southern Spain, including cities such as Cádiz and Málaga, will experience total darkness for over four minutes.

The eclipse will make landfall at the Strait of Gibraltar.

North Africa



Northern Morocco, particularly Tangier and Tetouan, will be directly beneath the central shadow.

Parts of Algeria and Tunisia will also be in the path.

In Benghazi, Libya, totality will last nearly five minutes.

Central Egypt, especially near Luxor, will experience more than six minutes of total darkness.

Northeastern Sudan will also fall under the path of totality.

August Solar Eclipse: Historical and scientific significance



Also Read |

On August 2, 2027, a remarkable total solar eclipse will darken the skies over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. For up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds, the Moon will completely obscure the Sun, casting a dramatic shadow over Earth in what is being called the “Great North African Eclipse.” This event will be the longest total solar eclipse visible from land between 1991 and 2114. With such an extended period of totality and broad visibility, this awe-inspiring celestial phenomenon will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for millions of people across continents, skywatchers, scientists, and photographers alike. It is expected to attract global attention, spark scientific discoveries, boost tourism, and create unforgettable memories for those witnessing the rare cosmic alignment.Clear skies are expected in many parts of North Africa, especially in Libya and Egypt, which are known for dry, sunny weather in August. These favourable conditions enhance the likelihood of an unobstructed view, making the region ideal for eclipse observation, scientific research, and astronomical tourism opportunities.The total solar eclipse will occur on Monday, August 2, 2027, during the early to mid-afternoon hours, depending on your location.Exact timings may vary by a few minutes depending on the observer’s precise location along the path of totality. The full eclipse duration, from first contact (partial eclipse begins) to final contact (partial eclipse ends), will last approximately 2.5 to 3 hours, with totality lasting up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds in select areas like Luxor, Egypt.Three rare astronomical conditions will occur simultaneously to produce such a long eclipse:These combined factors will result in a total solar eclipse lasting over six minutes, significantly longer than most eclipses, which typically range from two to three minutes.The eclipse will begin over the Atlantic Ocean and move eastward across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The path of totality, which is the narrow band where the eclipse will be fully visible, will be approximately 258 to 275 kilometers wide, offering breathtaking celestial views to millions of spectators across multiple continents, including rare opportunities for scientists to study solar corona and atmospheric changes.The eclipse will exit over the Indian Ocean and continue past the Chagos Archipelago before fading.The 2027 eclipse will not be visible in many parts of the world, including:Observers in these regions may not witness any part of the eclipse or will only experience a minor partial eclipse.The upcoming 2027 eclipse is not the longest in history, but it is the most significant of this century. The longest recorded total solar eclipse occurred on June 15, 743 BC, lasting 7 minutes and 28 seconds. However, the 2027 event will be the longest visible from land between 1991 and 2114. The next similarly long eclipse will not take place until August 23, 2114.This event is significant not only because of its rare duration but also because of its wide visibility across multiple countries. Scientists, astronomers, and casual observers alike will benefit from the opportunity to study the Sun’s corona and other solar phenomena during the extended period of totality. It also offers a rare moment of unity, as millions across continents will pause to witness the same celestial spectacle. For many, this eclipse will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience—both a scientific event and a shared moment of wonder.For those living near the eclipse path, it is a truly once-in-a-century opportunity. The combination of scientific importance and natural beauty makes this a date worth marking in calendars worldwide.","On August 2, 2027, a remarkable total solar eclipse will darken the skies over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Poll What is the most alarming aspect of the Shalarth ID scam? The amount of money involved. The extent of corruption.

What is the scam?

What were the loopholes exploited by govt staff?

Other weaknesses in the system

What is the extent of the scam?

Checks needed in the system





MUMBAI: Senior education officers in the Maharashtra govt have been accused of misusing a govt-run payments portal to create fake teacher IDs and siphoning funds. Fraudulent Shalarth IDs were also created for unqualified individuals, who were allegedly hired after paying a bribe of Rs 20 to 30 lakhs each to school management and education department officials.The IDs given when a teacher is recruited, are needed to access salary and other benefits. The deputy directors of education of Mumbai and Nagpur zones allegedly, between them, created thousands of fake IDs. Govt estimates the scope of the scam to be Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. Some arrests have already been madeFormer deputy director of education Ram Pawar explains, ""Once there is a vacancy and the school has selected the candidate, the school issues an appointment order. The candidate then takes this appointment order to the deputy director of education of that zone, who approves it and provides the candidate with a Shalarth ID and password. This ID is used to access salary and benefits—without it, the candidate cannot be paid. "" The Shalarth portal also houses financial information and personnel records for all education staffers.According to Ram Pawar, the authority to issue Shalarth IDs rests with the deputy director of education.Officials at the office have created bogus IDs and drawn salaries for fictitious individuals, for whom bank accounts were opened using fake credentials and fake photographs. Officials have also been accused of issuing Shalarth IDs and hiring unqualified people for posts of teachers and headmasters for a bribe.Scope for manipulation is minimal in govt-run schools as employment records are available for scrutiny within the administration and due to the regulations which staff need to follow. But govt oversight of the records of aided schools is limited. This allowed those managing the portal to appoint unqualified individuals and even create fake posts and withdraw salaries in their name.Misuse of the portal has been reported across the state. In Nagpur, unqualified teachers, headmasters, and other staff were accused of holding fake Shalarth IDs that were obtained after paying bribes to school management and education department staffers. Deputy director of education for Nagpur, Ulhas Narad, has been arrested. In many cases, teachers and other school staff helped govt officers to create fake IDs and bank accounts for a share of the loot. Also, govt staff demanded bribes to give eligible teachers backdated dues and increments after promotion (see report alongside).On July 18, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced in the state assembly that the Shalarth ID scam could amount to Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. He announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team to probe the ID scam. Dada Bhuse, the state school education minister, has meantime suspended the Mumbai deputy director, Sandeep Sangave.Former deputy director Ram Pawar says, ""An earnest effort must be made to examine records. The process cannot be top-down. Whatever the upper management decides, the onus must be on field officers who need to conduct rigorous checks.""","Shalarth IDs are needed to access salary and other benefits.

Poll Should documents like Aadhaar and voter ID be accepted for verifying electoral roll eligibility? Yes, they are valid and widely used No, stricter verification is needed

NEW DELHI: Disagreeing with Supreme Court ’s prima facie view that Aadhaar card , voter ID card and ration card be considered valid documents for its SIR of electoral rolls in Bihar, EC told the court that they cannot be relied upon — Aadhaar is just an identity proof; there are a large number of fake ration cards floating around in the country; and relying on existing voter cards would make the special drive futile.It, however, said citizenship of a person will not terminate on account of not being part of the electoral rolls. In a voluminous affidavit filed in SC late evening, the poll panel also said that there was no violation of any law and fundamental rights of voter in conducting the exercise and pleaded the court to dismiss the petition filed by 11 opposition parties, NGOs and some residents of Bihar for scrapping of SIR and holding the Nov assembly election on the previous electoral rolls which were revised in Dec.It said Section 9 of Citizenship Act has no application to SIR exercise. “Under the SIR exercise, citizenship of an individual will not terminate on account of the fact that he/she is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,” the affidavit said.Justifying its decision not to treat EPIC as proof of eligibility for inclusion in the electoral roll, EC said, “The conceptual and procedural integrity of a de-novo revision would stand undermined if EPICS, which are merely reflective of prior entries, are used to validate entries in a roll that is required to be constructed anew.The EPIC, being a by-product of an earlier electoral roll, cannot substitute the verification process mandated for fresh preparation. ”EC said given the widespread existence of fake ration cards, it has not been prescribed within a list of 11 documents to be relied upon for screening eligibility.“And it is submitted that Aadhaar is merely a proof of identity of a person.A person who seeks to claim a benefit can utilise an Aadhaar card to show he/she is who he/she claims to be... There are restrictions on usage of Aadhaar to check eligibility under Article 326,” it said.","EC says there are a large number of fake ration cards floating around in the country.

A shock exit

Poll Do you think Jagdeep Dhankhar’s resignation will have a major political impact? Yes, it could shift the dynamics No, it’s unlikely to change much

Dhankhar caught govt unawares on by allowing notice against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: It was business as usual till around 4pm for Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar. He presided over the opening day of the monsoon session of Rajya Sabha and attended a meeting of the business advisory committee of the House. At 3.53pm, a govt statement said the VP would be visiting Jaipur on Wednesday.Such a trip, while Parliament is in session, would have raised eyebrows. A few hours later, Dhankhar dropped a bombshell, abruptly announcing his resignation with immediate effect two years before his tumultous term was to end. ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as Vice-President of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution,"" he wrote in his letter to President Droupadi Murmu The move immediately set off speculation about the real trigger, with many wondering as to the nature of the medical condition that necessitated his quitting the constitutional position, second only to the President in protocol.Few were convinced about the health explanation, particularly given that those who visited him in recent months detected signs that he was less than happy, even as he made it a point to swear by the present political leadership.He underwent a cardiac procedure at AIIMS in March after he complained of uneasiness. On June 25, he had fainted while delivering a speech at Nainital. But he seemed to be in fine fettle on Monday, making his trademark interventions and betraying no sign of the graveness he invoked to explain his exit.Dhankhar, 74, assumed office in Aug 2022 and his tenure was till 2027.Jagdeep Dhankhar is the only vice president to quit while not in contention for presidentship. R Venkatraman, S D Sharma and K R Naryanan had resigned after becoming President, while V V Giri had quit to contest as an Independent for President. Bhairon Singh Shekhwat had stepped down on moral grounds after losing to Pratibha Patil in the presidential contest.In his resignation letter, Dhankhar thanked President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, the council of ministers, and all MPs for extending support to him during his tenure. ""I extend my deepest gratitude to the President of India for her unwavering support and the soothing wonderful working relationship we maintained during my tenure. I express my deep gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. Prime Minister's cooperation and support have been invaluable, and I have learned much during my time in office,"" he said in his letter.But the development came as a surprise to many in govt, although a few admitted to have noticed signs of restiveness in the voluble former Supreme Court lawyer.The inaugural day also saw the VP allowing submission of motion for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad high court: something that would equip him with the same say as the Lok Sabha Speaker in picking the three members of inquiry panel that would go into charges against the judge. This was perhaps the first such instance when the two Houses moved in parallel for removal of a judge. Significantly, the opposition was allowed to submit the motion a day after govt had announced at the all-party meeting on Sunday that LS would make the first move against the HC judge. Many saw this through the prism of the lawyer's interest in matters legal; especially his criticism of judiciary, but it struck many as unusual.The governing party had also seemed surprised when he allowed LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge to speak at length on the alleged security lapse that enabled the terrorists at Pahalgam to conduct their deadly carnage and US President Donald Trump's claims to have dragged India to the negotiation table during Operation Sindoor. Treasury benches felt that as the chairman, Dhankhar should have allowed Kharge to have his say only during the debate that is set to happen.But none of it seemed to qualify to be a trigger for his announcement. The timing: the inaugural day of a session when opposition aspires to put govt under pressure, could not be comforting for the governing coalition. To many, it seemed to be meant to embarrass govt. Opposition, which relentlessly attacked Dhankhar for alleged partisanship and twice came close to moving no-confidence motions against him, appears to have already smelt an opportunity and would like to cash in on it.The resignation seemed just as dramatic as BJP leadership's original decision to elevate him to the position. The decision to appoint him as West Bengal governor was seen as too generous for the new entrant to BJP who had once served as minister of state in the short-lived V P Singh govt. Despite the surprise, there is near unanimity in political circles that Dhankhar is not going to hang up his boots anytime soon. Those who have been interacting with him speak about a fresh innings: this time as a farmer representative belonging to Jat community who has served in the second most important constitutional position.","Dhankhar caught govt unawares on by allowing notice against Justice Varma.

(PTI)

Six minutes of terror

MUMBAI: Bombay HC termed the “torture” of accused number 1 in the train blasts case as “barbaric and inhuman” and, saying that complaints of many other accused also raised doubts that torture was inflicted, discarded the confessions obtained by the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) as “unreliable and inadmissible. ”The HC in its judgment elaborated on the complaints of torture by police to extract confessional statements from the accused. The alleged methods included splitting legs 180 degrees wide, tying individuals to a chair all night, denying food from morning to evening, and putting cockroaches in vests and rats in underwear amid a lot of beating.Justices Anil Kilor and Shyam Chandak, while acquitting all the dozen accused, invoked two-century-old history to invalidate confessions eked from threats, saying, “We can get the evidence of police atrocities from 1817… the passing of Bengal Police Regulation, 1817, is the example. This shows that for more than two centuries, the safeguards and checks are tried to be placed on malpractices of police officers. ”The defence argued that though the accused were in custody for over 60 days, police complained of non-cooperation. However, once MCOCA was invoked on Sept 24, 2006, 11 confessions poured in, showing they “are not voluntary but the result of continuous torture in police custody.”On Oct 9, 2006, when produced in court, all retracted the confessions and detailed the torture inflicted by ATS, defence counsel Yug Chaudhri argued.They also stepped in as defence witnesses, and their evidence merits acceptance, the HC held, since the cross-examination failed to dislodge their claim, which was “corroborated by medical and other evidence” to a “very substantial degree.”The HC said, “Not allowing a person to sleep, making him stand the whole night with his arms tied above his head, or stretching his legs to 180 degrees, as has been repeatedly testified to by the accused, will not leave visible scars on the body, no matter how much this may bruise the mind or injure the psyche.”While accused number 1, Kamal Ansari, who died in 2021 in prison, did not testify as a witness, HC noted his complaint in detail, alleging a DCP had said, “I won’t kill you, I have a pen, with this pen, I will make your life hell, your entire family will come on the road.” The high court said such detailed third-degree methods can’t be an “afterthought” as argued by the prosecution.Medical and ocular evidence “not only corroborates the complaint of A.1 of torture and its truthfulness but also the fact that police warned him not to disclose about the torture meted out to him by them to the doctor.”“The torture was barbaric and inhuman, and it exposes the frustration the officers might have had at the relevant time for obvious reasons,” said the HC, holding his confession can’t form the basis of convictions. The HC also came to a similar conclusion of torture being inflicted on many other accused.For instance, in the case of accused number 5, the HC said “evidence sufficiently hints at the possibility of torture being inflicted… to extort his confession.”The HC also said, “Detailed narration of torture with all the specific details creates doubt about torture to extort confession.”The judgment devoted 350-odd pages to confessions and about 100 pages to complaints of torture. The HC also said the prior approval to invoke MCOCA by an additional police commissioner was vitiated on grounds of complete non-application of mind by the then additional police commissioner.“The procedure(s) of sanction provided in the legislation are meant to be followed strictly, to the letter, more so to the spirit. Even the slightest of variation from the written word may render the proceedings arising therefrom to be cast in doubt,” the HC noted.","Bombay HC termed the “torture” of accused number 1 in the train blasts case as “barbaric and inhuman” The alleged methods included splitting legs 180 degrees wide, tying individuals to a chair all night, denying food from morning to evening, and putting cockroaches in vests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122823196,imgsize-160258,width-400,resizemode-4/122823196.jpg"

NEW DELHI: SC Monday refused to entertain a petition filed by Samajwadi Party (SP) questioning eviction of the party from a Pilibhit municipality-owned building, and said when a governing political party abuses or misuses its powers to illegally allot buildings to itself, it faces difficulties when it is not in power.Brushing aside spirited arguments from senior advocate Siddharth Dave, Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""If you (the party) misuse and abuse its powers to get municipality buildings allotted to itself, then it you cannot complain when the allotment gets cancelled when it is not in power.""Refusing to grant time to SP to vacate the premises, SC said, ""You do not remember the law when you are in a position to abuse your power.

Political battles are to be fought somewhere else. Go before the electorate and fight your political battles.""When Singhvi attempted to justify the filing of the appeal by the state against BJP neta, the bench softened him by saying any further argument would invite heavy cost. Singhvi accepted the dismissal of the state's petition without further demurrer.Next in line to be chastised was ED that had appealed against a Karnataka HC order quashing a case under the PMLA against BM Parvathi in the Muda case.Next was the turn of NGO Atmadeep, which had sought initiation of criminal contempt against Banerjee for her reported public statement that SC's judgment quashing the scam-riddled recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff would not be implemented. The bench gave senior advocate Maninder Singh an advice similar to those given to the Karnataka govt and ED. However, Singh said since initiation of contempt proceedings would require the attorney general's consent, the petitioner has approached the top law officer and is awaiting his response. ""Are you sure you will get the response,"" the bench asked and adjourned hearing on the petition.","In a rare instance, SC castigated Karnataka govt for pursuing prosecution against BJP MP Tejasvi Surya.

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED.

Invoking criminal law for recovery of money is abuse of law: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invoking-criminal-law-for-recovery-of-money-is-abuse-of-law-supreme-court/articleshow/122813710.cms,"Supreme Court

Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's view that FIRs for monetary disputes should not invoke criminal law? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Invoking criminal law by filing an FIR for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute, the Supreme Court said and expressed frustration over HCs allowing it in violation of its rulings.The apex court stated this while quashing criminal proceedings initiated by a production house against Bollywood filmmaker Shailesh Kumar Singh, who had produced ‘Tanu Weds Manu’, over a monetary dispute.“How many times HCs are to be reminded that to constitute an offence of cheating, there has to be something more than prima facie on record to indicate that the intention of the accused was to cheat the complainant right from the inception. The plain reading of FIR does not disclose any element of criminality,” a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said in an order on July 14.Indicating that HCs have virtually turned a deaf ear to its recent orders holding that such cases come within the ambit of civil suits, the bench referred to its verdicts which had settled the issue. It said SC in Aug had stated that a mere breach of contract cannot give rise to a criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the beginning of the transaction.“Every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of a manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person may seek his remedy for damages in civil courts but, any breach of trust with a mens rea, gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well,” it had said.Advocate Sana Raees Khan, appearing for producer Shailesh Kumar Singh, told the court that no criminal offence was made out against him and criminal prosecution should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of harassment. Agreeing with her, the bench quashed the FIR and also expressed shock on how the Allahabad HC dealt with the case by directing him to pay Rs 25 lakh to the complainant. SC also directed them to go for mediation.“We fail to understand why the HC should undertake such an exercise. The HC may either allow the petition saying that no offence is disclosed or may reject the petition saying that no case for quashing is made out. Why should the HC make an attempt to help the complainant to recover the amount due and payable by the accused. It is for the civil court or commercial court, as the case may be, to look into in a suit that may be filed for recovery of money or in any other proceedings,” SC said.“We are quite disturbed by the manner in which the HC has passed the impugned order. The HC first directed the appellant to pay Rs 25 lakh to the respondent, and thereafter, directed him to appear before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre for the purpose of settlement. That’s not what is expected of an HC to do in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution or a miscellaneous application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of FIR or any other criminal proceedings,” SC said.It said that “what is expected of the HC is to look into the averments and the allegations levelled in the FIR along with the other material on record, if any. The HC seems to have forgotten the well-settled principles as enunciated in the decision of this court”.",Supreme Court: Invoking criminal law by filing an FIR for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute.

NEW DELHI: Admitting that ED erred in summoning senior advocates Arvind Datar and Pratap Venugopal for rendering legal opinions to clients in a laundering case, attorney general R Venkataramani Monday told Supreme Court that all probe agencies have been asked not to commit this mistake in future.“We’ll frame guidelines in this regard,” AG told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while it was hearing a suo motu case regarding the summons, which were later withdrawn.“ED officers are crossing all limits. They must know that under law, communication between a lawyer and his client is a privileged communication,” Gavai said.However, if a lawyer is involved in a crime, law will take its own course,” CJI Gavai said. SC would take up petitions filed by various bar associations on July 29 to attempt to lay down comprehensive guidelines in this regard, he added.On the joint pleas of SCBA president Vikas Singh, SC Advocates-on-Record president Vipin Nair, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Vijay Hansaria, the CJI-led bench said it would frame guidelines for agencies and bar them from summoning advocates for legal opinion or advice rendered to clients facing prosecution.While agreeing with AG, solicitor general Tushar Mehta pointed out another malady afflicting some in the legal professions. ""It is equally wrong on the part of advocates, who appear for or advise a client, to create a planned narrative in favour of their client and against the probe agency through social media before and after filing of a petition in a court. Lawyers must stick to their duty of presenting the case before the court,” he said.Mehta said, ""The communication between a lawyer and his client is no doubt privileged and which must be immune from investigation, But would a lawyer's action in creating a narrative for his client outside the court also enjoy the status of a privileged communication? Would it not amount to an attempt to influence the public and judiciary about a case?”CJI Gavai asked, “Have you ever found a judgment or order of a court getting swayed or influenced by such narratives spun by lawyers outside the court? We go by facts and submissions in the courtroom and do not even watch or read what the lawyers speak outside the courtroom about the case.”Mehta said the issuance of summons to Datar was brought to the notice of the ‘highest executive’ and within six hours a circular was issued by the ED barring its officers from issuing summons to any advocate. Singh, Nair and Hansaria said issuance of summons to advocates by probe agencies would have a chilling effect on the independence of the legal profession.",ED erred in summoning senior advocates Arvind Datar and Pratap Venugopal for rendering legal opinions to clients in a laundering case.

It also directed the Union territory govt to pay Rs 50 lakh as compensation to the victim.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the way in which the constable was tortured for six days in 2023 had shocked the conscience of the court and expressed lack of confidence in the UT police conducting an impartial probe, given that they tried to shield the perpetrators of the offence by naming the victim as an accused.""The injuries caused to the appellant during his illegal detention, particularly the complete mutilation of his genitalia, use of pepper/chilly powder and electric shocks on his genitalia, are grave reminders of the inhuman torture meted out to the appellant while detaining him illegally. The cumulative effect of all these facts is deeply shocking to the conscience of this court,"" the bench said.""The entire material collected in enquiry conducted so far, including all related documents, medical records, CCTV footage, forensic evidence, and case diary, shall be immediately handed over to the competent officer of CBI.The director, CBI, shall constitute a SIT headed by an officer not below the rank of superintendent of police to investigate this matter. The police officials found responsible for the custodial torture shall be arrested forthwith and not later than a period of one month from today. The investigation shall be completed within 90 days of the date of registration of the RC,"" SC ordered.The court said the case was a classic example of institutional abuse and perversion of the criminal justice machinery to shield the perpetrators while victimising the complainant. It said the transformation of a torture victim into an accused through a concocted theory of attempted suicide, based on manifestly implausible medical opinion and glaring procedural violations, reflected institutional malice of the highest order.""This is not merely a case of investigative error or overreach; it is a calculated effort to fabricate charges, distort the narrative, and shield the real perpetrators of crime of custodial torture. The use of state machinery to invert the roles of victim and offender represents a grave subversion of the criminal process,"" it held. ""... We hereby direct the UT of J&K to pay compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the appellant.

Dhankhar told the House that in Dec, he received a motion for removal of the judge, ostensibly backed by 55 members. However, on verification, it was found that one particular MP had signed twice. Rules require a motion for the removal of a judge to be signed by 50 members of RS. tnn", RS chairman raises concerns over a member's signature appearing twice on a motion seeking the removal of Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahabad HC.

NEW DELHI: Congress urged Jagdeep Dhankhar to reconsider his resignation as vice president and petitioned PM Narendra Modi ""to get Dhankhar to change his mind"", lending support to the VP after he tendered his resignation in a shocking development late Monday, reports Subodh Ghildiyal. Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh, who is also the party chief whip in Rajya Sabha, called Dhankhar's resignation ""inexplicable"" which has more to it than meets the eye, and claimed that Dhankhar was scheduled to make ""some major announcements related to judiciary"" on Tuesday, when he had also scheduled the meeting of BAC that decides the agenda of the House for the week.The appeal stood out as odd because of Congress' consistent attack on Dhankhar for alleged partisanship. The party was the main force behind the two moves to bring no-confidence motions against him. Acknowledging the VP's claim of medical reason for resignation in the passing, Ramesh said, ""No doubt Dhankhar has to give topmost priority to his health. But clearly there is far more to his totally unexpected resignation than meets the eye.

‘Removal of judge will not be completed in current session’

NEW DELHI: Notices for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC were submitted in both Houses of Parliament on Monday in what could potentially result in the first instance of a judge being benched for alleged misconduct.While 145 LS members, cutting across party lines, signed the notice, 63 members belonging to different parties made an identical move in RS. Sources said that both the Houses are on the same legal footing in this regard and proceedings are likely to be launched in Lok Sabha.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, when notices of a motion are submitted on the same day in both Houses, a committee to examine the charges levelled against the judge will be constituted by LS Speaker and RS Chairman.The notable signatories to the LS notice, submitted to Speaker Om Birla, included leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi, BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad and Anurag Thakur, NCP-SP’s Supriya Sule, Congress’s K C Venugopal and K Suresh, DMK’s T R Baalu, RSP member N K Premachandran and IUML member E T Mohammed Basheer.The notice signed by 63 opposition RS members was submitted to Upper House chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar who, before his shock resignation as vice-president, said he had received a notice for the removal of Justice Varma.“It has been signed by more than 50 members of the council of states. Thus, it meets the numerical requirement of signing by MPs for setting in motion the process of removal of an HC judge,” Dhankhar said.On law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal’s confirmation that a notice has also been submitted in LS, Dhankhar asked the RS secretary general to “take necessary steps in this direction”. Hours after the opposition move, BJP also collected signatures of its RS members and those from its allies to file a notice. BJP sources said the opposition-sponsored notice in RS prompted the party to act as it did not want to be left out of the exercise in the Upper House.Party sources said they had no idea about the opposition’s unilateral move as they cited their own bipartisan exercise in LS seeking signatures from all parties. Govt sources, however, confirmed that the matter will be taken up in LS first. Sources also confirmed that since the petition is set to be referred to a committee, the removal of the judge will not be completed in the current session.According to the Act, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses. The committee comprising a senior SC judge, a sitting HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist will then probe the charges levelled against Justice Varma and will be asked to come out with a report in three months.As sources indicated that LS is set to witness the motion first, this is the second time that a motion for the removal of a judge is being brought in the House after 32 years. In 1993, Justice V Ramaswami, an SC judge, faced a removal motion in LS.","Notices for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC were submitted in both Houses of Parliament on Monday.

Pahalgam debate not set for first week, Cong slams govt

Turbulence ahead

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Monday set the tone for the govt’s response to the opposition’s demand for a discussion on “Operation Sindoor” and the Pahalgam attack by declaring India's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan a “100% success”.Modi was speaking against the backdrop of the opposition's plans to stage protests in the two Houses as well as the govt agreeing to hold a debate: a rhetorical skirmish which, as per the decision of the business advisory committee, an all-party affair, will pan out for at least 16 hours next week. As soon as the Lok Sabha kicked off proceedings, Congress and its allies demanded that the discussion be held straightaway.Congress also demanded that the Prime Minister personally respond to US President Donald Trump’s claim to have leaned on India to get it to negotiate the suspension of Operation Sindoor In his address, Modi emphasised that the armed forces achieved the success despite him having publicly warned them days by amplifying the intent to “raze the terrorists to the ground”.“This monsoon session should be a victory celebration, a vijayotsav (triumph). The entire world has witnessed the strength of Bharat's military capabilities. During Operation Sindoor, the Indian armed forces achieved their objectives with 100% success.Within just 22 minutes, the mission neutralised its target right inside the enemy’s territory. I had announced this during a programme in Bihar, and our armed forces accomplished it within a very short time,” the Prime Minister said.Congress members also insisted that leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi be permitted to speak, shouting slogans when he was disallowed by Speaker Om Birla, who said he could do so after question hour. Pleas by defence minister Rajnath Singh and parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju that the govt was ready to debate all the issues and that it was for the BAC to work out the date and duration of the debate also failed to cut ice.BJP, for its part, also sent the message that it was not going to chicken out of a fight. As soon as PM Modi entered the Lok Sabha after his media address, BJP and allied MPs greeted him with slogans of “Operation Sindoor” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai. In his customary remarks to the media on the inaugural day of the session, PM emphasised the global recognition of India’s indigenous defence capabilities.“When I meet world leaders, they express keen interest in Bharat’s homegrown defence equipment. A unified voice from Parliament celebrating this victory will inspire our armed forces and boost research, innovation, and manufacturing in the defence sector, creating jobs for our youth,” he said.Reflecting on the atrocities in Pahalgam, Modi praised all-party delegations that exposed Pakistan’s role in global terrorism. “Setting aside party differences, representatives from various states travelled to world capitals, successfully highlighting Pakistan as a hub of terrorism. Their efforts, in the national interest, created a positive atmosphere and opened global doors to India’s perspective,” he said. He said the success of astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s historic mission was another reason for Parliament to celebrate.Congress has slammed the govt for not scheduling the discussion on Pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week, and criticised prime minister Narendra Modi for “not giving importance” to the first session after the dastardly terror attack in J&K.Deputy leader of opposition in LS Gaurav Gogoi said the govt did not put Pahalgam and other issues before the business advisory committee which met on Monday afternoon to decide the business of the lower house. He said the govt did not fix any date or time for the discussion, describing it as “salt on the wounds of the grieving families”.The opposition continued with its protest on the opening day of the session and forced adjournment of LS even when the House met after the BAC meeting, indicating that it is bent on maintaining pressure, at least for the coming days.",PM Modi declares India's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan a “100% success’ Opposition demands discussion on Pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week.

In 2006, I was an MP from Mumbai and went and saw what happened in that terrorist attack.

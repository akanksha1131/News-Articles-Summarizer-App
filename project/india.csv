Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model.

UP Gears Up For Biggest Crackdown Yet As CM Yogi Mandates Detention Hubs For Illegal Immigrants

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday warned of a ""strict and decisive"" action against Bangladeshi and Rohingya ""infiltrators"" in the state. He advised the state residents to ensure that the ""identity of any individual is thoroughly verified before employing them in domestic or business activities. """"My esteemed residents of the state, The security of Uttar Pradesh, social harmony, and robust law and order are our utmost priority. Strict and decisive action has been initiated against Rohingya and Bangladeshi infiltrators residing illegally in the state,"" he said in a post on X.""I appeal to the vigilant public of the state to remain alert and ensure the identity of any individual is thoroughly verified before employing them in domestic or business activities. The security of the state is the collective responsibility of us all, for security is the foundation of prosperity,"" he added.The state police initiated an operation against Rohingya and Bangladeshi individuals suspected of residing unlawfully in the state. The action follows growing concerns about foreign nationals securing Indian identity papers through fraudulent methods.As per senior officials, authorities in 17 municipal bodies have been directed to quickly compile a list of foreign workers whose presence or employment appears suspicious.The government has emphasized that anyone attempting to settle in the state using forged documents will face strict action.A widespread verification drive for identity papers is also in progress after officials uncovered attempts by several Rohingya and Bangladeshi individuals to secure Aadhaar, voter IDs and other Indian documents to pass as local citizens. Authorities said the coordinated effort between police and the administration will ensure thorough scrutiny of every doubtful case.","Yogi Adityanath warned of a ""strict and decisive"" action against Bangladeshi and Rohingya ""infiltrators"" in the state.

In repeated burglary cakewalks, thieves have been raiding a Nadiad confectionery, Krishna Dairy Products, and have had criminally sweet success 10 times in nine years. The shop's owner, Mukesh Pandit, 44, said the burglars seem to treat money only as a light dessert. ""Most of the time, thieves took some cash but loads of mithai - to the tune of quintals,"" he said.Pandit, who opened the shop in 2015, told TOI, ""I filed complaints three times. Police merely made 'janva jog' (station diary entries). None of the burglaries were cracked."" He installed CCTVs to signal the sour consequences of pilferage, but burglars thought the digital video recorder is the cherry on top of their booty and nicked that too. ""Before I could reinstall CCTVs, burglars struck again,"" Pandit said. ""I have done everything to stop burglaries, from putting up iron grills to placing high-tech cameras. """"A point outside my shop has a police picket. But during VVIP visits and festivals, the cops leave to join bandobusts. The burglaries occur on these days,"" he said. The latest theft was on Nov 30, during which burglars stole 12kg of kaju katri worth Rs 12,000, 73.5kg of mixed mawa sweets worth Rs 38,200, and 35kg of shrikhand worth Rs 13,300. Other purloined items were mixed biscuits worth Rs 15,000, 70kg of namkeen worth Rs 16,800, and Rs 3,500 in cash.

Former CJI B.R. Gavai Clarifies He Never Faced Political Or Executive Pressure During His Tenure

CHANDIGARH: In a significant push for modernising the country's prison ecosystem, CJI Surya Kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms, ranging from digital-skills training to UK-style inmate-monitoring systems, aimed at transforming prisons from punitive spaces into ""engines of reintegration"".Highlighting the need to align prison training with the ""economy of tomorrow"", the CJI stressed that inmates must be equipped with digital competencies, logistics expertise, & modern vocational skills. He urged deeper industry collaboration, proposing a model where companies ""adopt"" prisons, offer apprenticeships, & eventually recruit trained inmates, turning ability into opportunity.CJI Kant was speaking on correctional reforms in Gurgaon on Saturday while inaugurating skill development and polytechnic courses inside Haryana jails.While giving one of his four ""thoughtful proposals"" to strengthen correctional justice framework, the CJI said that the suggestion is regarding opening or establishing either the open jails or just following paradigm shift that has taken place in the United Kingdom with the help of a software company based in Bangalore, where a chip is provided to the convicts, who are allowed to stay at homes within defined radius.""Their movements are monitored through advanced software, ensuring compliance while allowing individuals to maintain family life, emotional bonds, financial stability, and continuity for their children, often the 'invisible victims' of incarceration,"" the CJI said.The CJI also pushed for creating or expanding open prisons in India as part of this humane rethinking of criminal justice.He concluded by reminding that data-driven reforms are essential. ""A modern incarceration system must track behavioural progress and post-release trajectories, ensuring that rehabilitation is measurable, accountable, and effective. Such a system, he said, would help measure the real effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes and reduce recidivism,"" he said.The CJI said that when individuals step out of prison and return to society without adequate support, their reintegration becomes not only difficult but dangerously uncertain. Without guidance, many are pulled back into a cycle of marginalisation and renewed conflict with the law. He said that in the absence of education, skills, psychological support, and structured reintegration, a prison, what he prefers to call a ""correctional home"", can unintentionally become a place where disadvantages deepen and custodial cycles repeat.Reformative justice today demands clear thinking, coordinated action, and systems designed for renewal rather than return, he said.CJI Kant has long been known for championing correctional reforms for jail inmates. Even during his tenure as a judge of Punjab and Haryana high court, he delivered a landmark judgment in the Jasbir Singh case, holding that the right of convicts or jail inmates to have conjugal visits - or alternatively to seek artificial insemination for progeny - is a Fundamental Right.Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah, Rajesh Bindal and Augustine George Masih of SC and Sheel Nagu, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana HC, HC judge Justice Lisa Gill and executive chairperson, Haryana State Legal Services Authority, along with Judges of HC and other dignitaries from the state administration, attended the programme.","CJI Surya Kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms to the country's prison ecosystem.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

PANAJI: Grief curdled into rage outside the morgue of Goa Medical College and Hospital on Sunday as relatives and friends of the 25 victims in the Arpora nightclub blaze, most of them migrant staffers, squatted in the harsh afternoon sun and demanded to know: Where are the owners?Nobody from the management of Birch By Romeo Lane nightclub was there as the acrid smell of formaldehyde drifted through the morgue's entrance, mingling with the despair of the families and friends of those killed in the inferno.Some had rushed to the hospital after working through the night at other party spots in town, most of which employ people from some of the remoter parts of the country, including Jharkhand and the North-East. ""We want to talk to the owners. Why else would we sit here?"" said a friend of Vivek Chhetri, one of the victims.A young man works at a club in Vagator run by the Luthra brothers, owners of Birch By Romeo Lane, and wouldn't give his name for fear of losing his job. ""Those who knew of the fire ran away, but they did not inform our boys who were down in the basement kitchen. They ran and saved themselves, leaving the boys behind,"" he said.Many of those who had come to identify the dead carried pictures shared with them over WhatsApp by the victims' families. Some were brothers, nephews, cousins or neighbours.Jharkhand native Narayan Mahto, who works at Agacaim, was there to identify two brothers - 18 and 22.""They were my nephews,"" he said. ""A third boy from my state died in the fire. They followed me here to find work barely 6 months ago,"" he said.Uncertainty over how they would send the bodies home after identification weighed on the minds of anguished faces huddling to discuss what to do next.""Either the owners or state govt needs to look into this. How do I arrange to have a body sent from here to my country?"" said Padam, a young man from Nepal working in Goa. He was there to identify the body of a victim he had never met.""I came here at 8am after receiving a call from a family friend related to the deceased.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

PANAJI: Fifteen minutes. That's all it took for Bhavana Joshi to lose her husband and three sisters inside a nightclub that was supposed to crown a holiday in Goa with music and laughter for the family of five from Ghaziabad and Delhi. Flames tore through the club moments after they had stepped into Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora late Saturday.Bhavana lived. The other four didn't. Her husband Vinod Kumar pushed her through the main entrance as panic broke loose, police said. She stumbled into the open, coughing, burning-eyed, alive. Then he turned back. Inside were Bhavana's three sisters, Anita, Saroj and Kamala, who had travelled with them for a short break that began on Dec 4. He went after them. Fire swallowed them all.Outside, Bhavana waited. She kept dialling Vinod's phone. It rang. Again and again. When the body was carried out, her phone was clenched in her hand, still calling out. The family of five had been staying at a hotel in Baga.What began as a leisure trip ended at a police barricade outside a blackened club, with hotel staff trying to comfort a woman who no longer had a family beside her.Relatives rushed to Goa through the night. ""Their children are waiting at home. All their relatives are waiting too,"" a family member said. ""We haven't told them that all four have died. We have only said two sisters are dead and the other two are missing. We want to take their bodies back."" Another relative held up a phone, trembling.""Look at this picture of my sister-in-law. She is completely charred. She has no skin left.""For Bhavana, the holiday ended in a circle of police tape and silence - saved by a man who walked back into fire so that others might live. Now only she remains to tell the children how their parents' last night together ended in minutes, and how love chose the flames.","Bhavana Joshi, her husband and three sisters were killed in a Goa nightclub fire.

NEW DELHI: A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While there has been a slight improvement compared to recent weeks, many parts of the city remained shrouded in dense haze.Areas including Ghazipur Mandi, Anand Vihar, and Wazirpur experienced severely reduced visibility due to the smog. CPCB data showed Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 366, Sonia Vihar 352, Wazirpur 359, and Ghazipur Mandi 366, all in the ‘very poor’ range. Bawana recorded the highest AQI at 375 at 7 am, while NSIT Dwarka measured 260, categorised as ‘poor’.The India Gate and Kartavya Path areas were also covered in smog, with the AQI in the region at 311, falling under the ‘very poor’ category.According to the AQI scale, 0–50 is ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.In response to the worsening air quality, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a statement on Friday following a question raised by MP Dr.Laxmikant Bajpayee in the Rajya Sabha. He had asked whether it was true that “one in every seven deaths in Delhi can be attributed to the city’s toxic air as claimed by several studies and reported in the media.”Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh replied that various studies have been conducted by academic and research institutes on the impact of air pollution. He added that in 2025, the AQI in Delhi had not reached the ‘severe plus’ level on any day.The government continues to take measures to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), established under the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, oversees air quality in Delhi and neighbouring regions.The Commission has been working collaboratively with all major stakeholders to reduce pollution. It has issued 95 statutory directions to guide action against air pollution and has prepared a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage pollution during peak winter months. Stricter emission norms for polluting activities in the NCR have also been implemented, and regular review meetings are held to monitor progress.","A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am.

Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

150 years of Vande Mataram: Why BJP and Congress are fighting over its ‘missing stanzas’ — explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/150-years-of-vande-mataram-why-bjp-and-congress-are-fighting-over-its-missing-stanzasexplained-parliament-lok-sabha-debate/articleshow/125813886.cms,"Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (Image credit: PIB)

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Why it’s in the news now



Origins of Bande Mataram (1870s–1880s)



Song’s literary context: Anandamath

The Mother that was – glorious and mighty The Mother that is – suffering and oppressed The Mother that will be – restored to strength and glory

From song to slogan: Birth of a nationalist cry (1900–1910)



Swadeshi and anti-partition movement

Boycott movements Protest marches Newspapers and political groups carrying its name

Figures who popularised it included:

Rabindranath Tagore

Bipin Chandra Pal

Sri Aurobindo

British repression

Fines for students

Police lathi-charges

Bans on marches

Threats of expulsion from schools and colleges

The song and the Indian National Congress



1937 CWC decision: Were the stanzas removed?



Did it 'sow seeds of partition'?



What the 1937 CWC actually said

The first two stanzas had become widely used and carried no controversial imagery.

The remaining stanzas contained “allusions and a religious ideology” inconsistent with the beliefs of other religious groups.

Only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.

Organisers were free to choose additional songs if they wished.

Constituent assembly: Equal honour, equal status (1950)

Jana Gana Mana would be the national anthem.

Vande Mataram, because of its historic role, would be honoured equally and accorded equal status.

The debate today



Why is the BJP reviving the issue?

Why is the Congress defensive?

The 1937 decision was guided by inclusivity, not division.

The BJP is weaponising history to distract from contemporary governance failures.

Tagore and the freedom movement need protecting from political revisionism.

What Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has to say



Vande Mataram

Parliament will begin a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to commemorate 150 years of Vande Mataram, a song that remains one of the most debated symbols of India’s freedom struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the debate, with defence minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. The BJP has been given three hours in the Lok Sabha, the total debate will span nearly ten hours. The Rajya Sabha will hold its discussion the next day, to be opened by Union home minister Amit Shah.The commemoration is not merely ceremonial. It arrives amid renewed political sparring over the song’s historical evolution, religious imagery, and the choices made by India’s pre-independence national leadership. What began as a patriotic hymn in a Bengali novel is once again a focal point of fierce political messaging, competing historical narratives, and questions about national identity.This explainer traces the 150-year journey of Vande Mataram—from its birth in Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s writing to its role in nationalism, the Congress’s 1937 decision to officially use only its first two stanzas, and its recognition in the Constituent Assembly as having “equal honour and status” with the National Anthem.The upcoming debate is part of a special parliamentary focus on the legacy of Vande Mataram. But the political temperature was raised last month, during the commemoration event of 150 years of the national song, when Prime Minister Modi accused the Congress of having “removed important stanzas” from the original song during its 1937 Faizabad session, claiming this decision “sowed the seeds of partition.”According to the Prime Minister, the Congress’s move amounted to breaking the national song into pieces—an act that abandoned its original spirit and undermined unity. He has framed the issue within his broader narrative of 'Viksit Bharat', tying cultural heritage to national development.The Congress hit back immediately. Citing The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (Vol66, p46), the party argued that the 1937 decision was not an act of division, but a sensitive accommodation recommended by a Working Committee that included Mahatama Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Rajendra Prasad, Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, and other iconic leaders. The CWC noted that the first two stanzas were already the only widely sung and nationally recognised part, while the remaining contained religious imagery that some citizens objected to.The Congress also emphasised that the decision drew from the advice of Rabindranath Tagore, who had himself sung Vande Mataram at the 1896 Congress session.In its rebuttal, the party accused the prime minister of attacking the legacy of India’s freedom movement while avoiding present-day issues such as unemployment, inequality, and foreign policy challenges.This political exchange has made the upcoming parliamentary debate all the more charged.The PIB’s historical account helps clarify the origins of the song. According to Sri Aurobindo’s writing in the English daily Bande Mataram (16 April 1907), Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay composed the song around 1875. It was published more widely when Bankim’s novel Anandamath began serialization in the Bengali magazine Bangadarshan in March–April 1881.Anandamath is built around a group of ascetic warriors, the Santanas, who dedicate themselves to freeing the motherland from oppression. Their devotion is entirely to Bharat Mata, envisioned not as a religious deity but as a personified motherland.In the temple of the Santanas stand three images of the Mother:For Aurobindo, the hymn embodied the essence of “the religion of patriotism.”Many later critics, however, would argue that the imagery—particularly in the later stanzas—draws from Hindu goddess symbolism that may not be inclusive of all communities.By the early 20th century, Vande Mataram had escaped its literary origins and become one of the most electrifying symbols of Indian nationalism.After Lord Curzon’s 1905 partition of Bengal, the song became the rallying cry for:In 1906, at Barisal, more than 10,000 Hindus and Muslims together marched shouting Vande Mataram—a testament to its early cross-communal appeal.Aurobindo’s writings in Bande Mataram (the newspaper) turned the phrase into a political and spiritual exhortation for self-rule.Alarmed by its galvanising effect, the colonial government tried repeatedly to suppress it through:From Bengal to Bombay Presidency, chanting Vande Mataram became synonymous with nationalist defiance.In 1907, Madam Bhikaji Cama unfurled the first tricolour abroad—in Stuttgart—with the words Vande Mataram emblazoned across it.The Congress adopted Vande Mataram not just culturally, but ceremonially.1896 —First Congress rendition: At the Calcutta session, Rabindranath Tagore sang the song, giving it national prominence.1905 — Nationwide adoption: At the Varanasi session, the Congress formally adopted Vande Mataram for all-India occasions. This was during the peak of the Swadeshi struggle, when the song had become the soundtrack of political awakening.Yes.By the 1930s, debates around the song’s religious imagery had become politically relevant. India’s nationalist leadership wanted to keep the movement inclusive, and Muslim leaders raised objections to certain stanzas that invoked Hindu goddesses.No.The CWC's decision was more inclusive than divisive in nature.The eventual decision to restrict Vande Mataram to its first two stanzas drew directly from this history of selective popular usage. As the Committee noted, only the opening verses — celebrating the land’s beauty and abundance in gentle, inclusive imagery — had organically acquired national significance over the decades.The remaining stanzas were scarcely known, rarely sung, and contained religious allusions and ideological references that many felt were inconsistent with the beliefs of other communities. The CWC explicitly acknowledged the “validity of the objections raised by Muslim friends” to those portions.While emphasising that the song’s modern, unifying role in national life mattered far more than its origins in a historical novel, the committee concluded that only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.This, they argued, preserved the unifying spirit the song had come to embody while avoiding elements that could alienate sections of India’s diverse society.The CWC’s statement, issued between October 26–November 1 in Kolkata, recorded:The committee explicitly said that the modern national use of the first two stanzas was more important than the song’s original placement in a religiously infused novel.Tagore had long argued that when a cultural symbol is used nationally, it must not exclude or alienate. His views shaped the committee’s decision and remain central to the Congress’s defence today.When the Constituent Assembly met to choose India’s national symbols, there was no dispute between Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram.In his statement on January 24, 1950, DrRajendra Prasad, President of the Assembly, declared:There was applause; no member raised objections.This dual recognition was meant to preserve both inclusivity and historical memory: the anthem would represent national unity, while Vande Mataram’s legacy would be canonised as part of India’s freedom story.For the ruling party, Vande Mataram is a civilizational invocation that predates partisan politics. The BJP frames the 1937 Congress decision as overly accommodative, even compromising, and often ties this critique to a larger argument about “appeasement.”In the government’s view, celebrating 150 years of the song is part of a project to reaffirm cultural pride and national self-confidence.The Congress insists it is the party that first elevated the song, sang it at historic moments, and fought the British under its banner. It argues that:The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, led by Maulana Mahmood Madani, has taken a clear and consistent position on thedebate: it accepts the first two stanzas as historically validated for national use but firmly rejects the remaining verses on theological grounds.Madani argued that the full composition contains imagery — particularly the depiction of the motherland as the goddess Durga — that conflicts with Islamic monotheism, making it impermissible for Muslims to recite.""He stated that Vande Mataram in its complete form is rooted in shirkiya aqaaid (polytheistic beliefs). Particularly, in the remaining four stanzas, the motherland is depicted as the goddess Durga and addressed with words of worship — concepts that clearly conflict with the Islamic belief in the oneness of God. 'Muslims believe in one God and worship Him alone,' Maulana Madani said. 'Therefore, singing verses that ascribe divinity to anyone other than Allah goes against our faith and conscience,'"" a statement by Jamiat said.","Parliament will begin a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to commemorate 150 years of Vande Mataram. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the debate, with defence minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. It arrives amid renewed political sparring over the song’s historical evolution. What began as a patriotic hymn in a Bengali novel is a focal point of fierce political messaging.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125815916,imgsize-732549,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

NEW DELHI: A new controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users for the needs of law enforcement agencies and disaster management officials.The matter, which has been in discussion for over five years now, had seen a suggestion by the mobile phone operators lobby, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), that govt order compulsory activation of A-GPS technology. This uses satellite and mobile data to give accurate and accelerated location of an individual. However, no action has been taken on the matter by the ministry of electronics and IT (Meity), which had been conducting talks with the industry — both mobile operators as well as device makers. Currently, phone operators provide location of individuals by tracking users through mobile towers, which lack pinpoint accuracy, while also being delayed in giving the coordinates.Sources said not much progress had been made in five years around implementation over issues related to user privacy as well as reluctance of device makers such as Apple and Samsung over mandated activation. The device makers argue that user consent needs to be taken before activation of pinpoint satellite-based location tracking.Also, they have expressed fears that other service providers, and even hackers, may misuse the always-on location tracking services, violating user privacy.The issue has come to the fore at a time when govt rescinded on a plan to mandate pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app after outcry over possible state surveillance as well as user privacy violations. In this case too, global manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung had told the department of telecom — which had issued the pre-installation order — of their objections to the measure, citing user privacy.",New controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users.

Decolonisation a route to Hindi imposition?

guru–shishya

NEP and Decolonisation

It depends on every individual what they want to consider as a link language. Many people want Hindi as a link language, and some may prefer another. The objective is not to impose one language over another. It is like an orchestra where everything will go in tandem with each other. Pradeep Bhandari said

INDIA bloc on NEP and Hindi 'imposition'

Undoing Macaulay or reimagining India?

In ancient India, knowledge often travelled into the subcontinent, not out of it. Scholars journeyed from China, Korea, Tibet, Central Asia and Persia to study in centres like Takshashila and Nalanda, where mathematics, astronomy, grammar, statecraft and medicine flourished.These were not mere stone structures but the heart of an intellectual civilisation whose instruction was rooted in local languages and knowledge systems. However, over centuries, invasions and later colonial rule thinned this tradition, and by the 20th century, India was no longer exporting knowledge as confidently as it once did.In modern India, polished English often opened doors. It helped in landing jobs, signalled education, enabled migration and allowed an engineer from Chennai and a banker from Delhi to collaborate without needing a common mother tongue.At the same time, English has long carried a social undertone. A fluent speaker is often assumed to be intelligent, cosmopolitan, and somehow ""smarter."" A hesitant speaker may be judged as less capable.It is this perception, not the language itself, that lies at the heart of India’s growing conversation on decolonisation, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a ""Macaulay Mindset"" during a Ram Mandir's Dhwajarohan event in Ayodhya on November 25.English entered India through trade, diplomacy and eventually conquest. The British East India Company and later the Crown used the language for administration and governance. But English did not spread organically. It was strategically introduced to build an intermediary class that would think like the colonial rulers.In 1835, Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and politician, famously argued in “Minute on Indian Education” that English would create a class of Indians who were Indian by birth but English in intellect and sensibilities. Macaulay wanted Indians who were, in his words, “Indian in blood and colour but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.”Macaulay and other early British administrators were ignorant of India’s ancient glories — great literature and philosophy (Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads), sophisticated maths and astronomy (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara), and fabulous architecture (from Mohenjo-daro to Sanchi and Nalanda). This ignorance and racism led Macaulay to say, “A single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia. ”The plan worked. Knowledge systems rooted in Sanskrit, Tamil, Persian and other languages were slowly sidelined. English became the language of courts, universities and bureaucracy. Access to power became tied to access to English.By the early twentieth century, a new elite had emerged. English-educated and urban, and influential. They authored newspapers, argued in courtrooms, entered civil services and steered nationalist politics. Ironically, the language of colonial control also became the language of resistance, enabling leaders like Nehru and Ambedkar to articulate modern political thought for the world.Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sangh’s decolonisation project has widened from language to symbols and institutions. Rajpath was renamed Kartavya Path, the Indian Navy adopted a new ensign inspired by Shivaji Maharaj, and spaces like the National War Memorial, Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and Yuge Yugeen Bharat gallery were created to showcase civilisational continuity.The address of the Prime Minister’s official residence at 7, Race Course Road (7 RCR) was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016 by the New Delhi Municipal Council, replacing a colonial-era name with one that emphasises welfare and public good. PM Modi has also renamed the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as Sewa Tirth.Education reforms through the National Education Policy 2020 encourage mother-tongue learning and allow engineering, medical and law courses in regional languages. Technical textbooks are being translated into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and more, with the UGC expanding regional-language undergraduate programmes. The three-language policy promotes Indian languages alongside English.In January 2022, the government installed a 28-foot hologram of Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate on his 125th birth anniversary, under the canopy where King George V once stood. It served as a temporary tribute before a granite statue replaced it later that year, symbolically shifting the space from colonial memory to the legacy of the freedom struggle.In September 2023, ahead of the G20 Summit in New Delhi, official dinner invitations sent by Rashtrapati Bhavan referred to Droupadi Murmu as the “President of Bharat” instead of the customary “President of India”, marking what was widely reported as the first such instance in an English-language state invite.Government vocabulary now includes terms like Seva Saptah, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Bharat in diplomatic use. Museum projects and tributes to figures like Birsa Munda and Alluri Raju widen the historical lens.However, the conversation around decolonisation is not without anxieties. In several non-Hindi speaking states, particularly in the South and the Northeast, language is tied closely to identity, history and political autonomy.Many regional leaders and scholars worry that the push to move away from English might gradually translate into privileging Hindi at the national level.To them, decolonisation could risk becoming centralisation if it does not explicitly protect linguistic diversity. The concern is less about opposing Indian languages and more about ensuring that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese and others enjoy equal visibility and policy support.Calling PM Modi's decolonisation pitch an effort to recognise India's historical strength and move away from the mindset of a ""white man's burden"", BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""It has nothing to do with what language you speak. The idea here is to focus on and promote indigenous education and inherent strength"".""If you see the New Education Policy, it focuses on recognising inherent talent in the individual irrespective of the language and the region you come from. If one recalls historically, India was an education capital. Our Vedic rituals, ourparampara, were something which the world wanted to emulate. In fact, Nalanda was considered to be a centre of excellence globally, where scholars from across the world used to come, learn, and then try to emulate it in their own countries,"" he said.The BJP leader also countered the notion that the decolonisation push is a route to Hindi imposition, calling it ""unfair and political"" criticism.Referring to the New Education Policy (NEP), he said it focuses on promoting education in one's own language. ""Whether one speaks Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or any other language... the idea is to focus and promote education and excellence in any language of choice.""On the question of language hierarchy and how Hindi-speaking states would connect with non-Hindi-speaking ones if English is deprioritised, he added that in the age of technology, linguistic barriers are dissolving.Chief ministers from the INDIA bloc have repeatedly expressed concerns that the NEP may lead to language centralisation. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has been the most vocal, saying, ""The Centre knows it cannot directly impose Hindi without facing fierce opposition, so it uses education as a backdoor.""Kerala initially opposed NEP, calling it overly centralised and saffronised, although it later agreed to implement PM-SHRI schools while insisting that state autonomy in education must be respected.PM-SHRI, or Prime Minister’s Schools for Rising India, is a scheme launched in 2022 to upgrade around 14,500 existing government schools into modern model schools that reflect the vision of the National Education Policy.CM Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has chosen not to fully adopt NEP, saying the state will follow its own education model instead. The broader concern among these states is that decolonisation should not turn into Hindi dominance and that regional languages like Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali must be given equal space.In Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray have both opposed what they called attempts at ""Hindi imposition,"" particularly in schools. Uddhav described the move to make Hindi compulsory under the three-language policy as a threat to Marathi identity, saying, ""We will not allow the imposition of Hindi.""The Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS even announced a joint protest in Mumbai, after which the state rolled back the order that proposed to make Hindi compulsory as a third language in Maharashtra schools, for Classes 1 to 5.Two centuries after Macaulay, India is not trying to erase English. It is trying to recalibrate identity. English no longer needs to sit at the top of an invisible ladder. Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Manipuri and dozens of other languages do not need to stand below it.If decolonisation means confidence in one’s own language and culture while engaging the world without self-doubt, India might emerge more multilingual, more inclusive and more global than before. The challenge is to ensure that promoting indigenous languages does not turn into replacing one hierarchy with another.Undoing Macaulay will not be about removing English. It will be about removing the idea that language decides intellect. When English becomes one language among many rather than the measure of modernity, India will have truly decolonised.","In ancient India, knowledge often travelled into the subcontinent, not out of it.

IndiGo Fiasco: Civil Aviation Minister Slams Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Monopoly Model’ Remark

NEW DELHI: IndiGo will carry out a “root cause analysis” to determine what triggered the large-scale flight disruptions over the past week, a senior airline official said Sunday.India’s largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.The airline, which normally operates around 2,300 flights daily, expects to fly 1,650 services on Sunday — an improvement from 1,500 flights a day earlier. The official said operations are gradually stabilising and “full stability in operations is expected by December 10”.The official, as quoted by PTI, maintained that IndiGo has enough pilots and rejected concerns of shortages. “Our pilot numbers are fine while we may not have the luxury of having a buffer,” he said, adding that there is “no hiring freeze” and denying that a lean model triggered the crisis.He emphasised that the disruptions stemmed from several simultaneous issues. “We will need a root cause analysis, which will obviously take time...the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role (will be known after the root cause analysis),” he said. The official also described the episode as a “learning experience”, insisting “there was no question of inadequacy”.IndiGo has been struggling since November 1 when the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms — which reduce the number of night landings allowed — came into effect. While all airlines transitioned to the new norms, IndiGo faced the sharpest impact, partly due to having a smaller pilot buffer. ""We did not have the same kind of buffer. But that does not mean that there is a question of inadequacy, no. These are two different things,"" the official said.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras, seeking explanations for the disruptions. Asked whether the meltdown could have been prevented, the official said, ""We will do our root cause analysis... we will do that and then we will come to know (what was the) planning lapse, if at all,"" as quoted by PTI.Looking ahead, IndiGo maintained it is ready for the fog season. The official said the airline has adequate number of aircraft and pilots and is “confident of managing the fog season.”","India's largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo flight disruptions have entered their sixth day, with the airline expecting to stabilise operations by December 10. The ongoing crisis has caused widespread inconvenience, as cancellations, flight delays, and other major operational issues have left multiple passengers across major cities stranded at airports.However, the airline has announced plans to operate over 1,650 flights by the end of the day and assured that refunds are being processed fully. The civil aviation ministry said that refunds totalling Rs 610 crore have been processed so far following IndiGo flight disruptions, news agency PTI reported.Here are the top developmentsIndiGo cancelled 650 flights on Sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on December 7, as disruptions entered their sixth consecutive day. More than 220 flights were cancelled across the Delhi and Mumbai airports, even as efforts continued to stabilise operations. The ongoing crisis has led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in recent days, causing significant hardship for thousands of passengers.According to news agency PTI, at least 112 flights were cancelled at Mumbai airport and 109 at Delhi airport on Sunday. This follows a turbulent few days for the airline.After cancelling around 1,600 of its 2,300 daily flights on Friday, disruptions eased slightly on Saturday, with cancellations dropping to approximately 800.IndiGo also cancelled nine flights at the MBB Airport on Sunday, an airport official confirmed. “Due to the ongoing problem, IndiGo has cancelled nine scheduled flights, including both arrivals and departures, from MBB Airport on Sunday. It will, however, operate two flights as scheduled,” MBB Airport Director KM Nehra said.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Sunday said the airline will operate around 1,650 flights during the day as operations gradually stabilise after several days of large-scale cancellations and delays that caused hardship to thousands of passengers across the country.In an internal video message to staff from the airline’s operational control centre, Elbers said the airline’s On Time Performance (OTP) is expected to be around 75 per cent on Sunday. “Today, we have realised further improvements of the system in order to reach around 1,650 flights,” he said.Explaining steps taken to reduce passenger inconvenience, the CEO added, “We have been able to execute the cancellations at an earlier stage so that the customers do not show up at the airport in case their flights are cancelled.”According to IndiGo, 137 out of its 138 destinations are in operation today.Thousands of passengers remain affected due to massive cancellations, delays and other operational issues. Many passengers lost their temper with the ground staff at the airports. Various videos circulating online show passengers getting aggressive with staff.Flyers across various airports also shared accounts of getting stuck at the airport, disrupting their plans. A passenger at the Delhi airport shared how he was expected to return on Friday but was stuck at the Patna airport only touched down in Delhi on Sunday.Amid the chaos, some passengers also tried to keep up the spirit of their fellow crisis-bearers by recreational activities like singing and dancing.The government on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines for charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees, and taxes extra).In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha summoned IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and other top officials to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan and gave the airline two days instead of the 21 sought by the carrier to fully restore operations. The ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, using its powers directly rather than leaving the matter to the aviation regulator, DGCA.IndiGo, which controls 60% of domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on December 7 and return checked-in baggage within two days.The airline has also been barred from charging any rescheduling fees, which it had been levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.The civil aviation regulator gave a one-time extension till 6 pm on Monday (December 8) after IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and COO–accountable manager Isidre Porqueras sought more time to submit a detailed response.The airline cited the scale of its network and multiple unavoidable factors behind recent operational disruptions while requesting the extension beyond the original 24-hour deadline.DGCA warned that no further extension will be allowed and failure to respond in time will lead to ex-parte action, while it continues to closely monitor passenger safety and regulatory compliance.IndiGo expects to gain back some stability by December 10, as per reports by the news agency PTI. The airline also issued an apology letter stating it expected to operate 1,500 flights by the end of Sunday.""Today, we are on our way to operate over 1500 flights by the end of the day,"" said IndiGo in their notice, ""With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations""As per the official statement by the airlines, the Board of Directors met on the first day the flight cancellations and delays began, and was given a detailed briefing by the management on the scale of the crisis.The company said the Board later held an internal session where it decided to establish a Crisis Management Group comprising the chairman, directors and CEO Pieter Elbers.According to the company, the group has been meeting regularly and receiving continuous updates on measures to restore normal operations, with additional telephonic consultations held with other Board members.Union minister of state for civil aviation and cooperation, Murlidhar Mohol, on Sunday, assured that the centre is monitoring the IndiGo flight disruptions seriously and immediate actions will be taken against the airlines after the investigation committee's report is submitted.The statement comes in light of the airlines not adhering to the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL). The minister also noted the ""mental harassment"" being borne by the passengers affected.""All passengers have suffered mental distress and have had to face many difficulties. They had to endure mental harassment because of IndiGo,"" said the minister.The Railways has announced 89 special trains to operate across all zones over the next three days, beginning Saturday, to assist passengers affected by IndiGo’s large-scale flight cancellations. Officials said the trains, arranged at short notice after reviewing traffic conditions in major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna and Howrah, will together make more than 100 trips.They added that efforts are being made to widely publicise the special services, with some railway divisions sharing information at nearby airports to guide stranded travellers. The South Eastern Railway has also requested airport authorities to display details of the newly introduced special trains.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers, holding the airline responsible for the large-scale operational disruptions seen in recent days and citing “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management.”The aviation regulator on Saturday asked the CEO to submit an explanation within 24 hours, following a week of widespread cancellations and delays that have left thousands of passengers stranded across the country.“You are hereby directed to show cause within 24 hours of receipt of this notice as to why appropriate enforcement action should not be initiated against you under the relevant provisions of the Aircraft Rules and Civil Aviation Requirements for the above-mentioned violations,” the notice stated.","IndiGo cancels 650 flights on Sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on December 7. More than 220 flights were cancelled across the Delhi and Mumbai airports, even as efforts continued to stabilise operations. Civil aviation ministry said that refunds totalling Rs 610 crore have been processed so far.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125816092,imgsize-1583997,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

NEW DELHI: The fire at a nightclub in Goa, which killed 25 people, started after fireworks were set off inside, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Sunday.Police had earlier suggested that a cylinder blast caused the blaze, but Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said the preliminary inquiry showed the fire was triggered by electrical firecrackers set off inside the Arpora club.""According to the preliminary inquiry, the fire broke out due to the bursting of some electrical firecrackers inside the club. Some people could come out, but others could not, due to which they lost their lives. A complete inquiry is being done, and a report will be recieved within a week.

Cap on fares comes too late for lakhs

NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees and taxes extra). In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed. These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action in public interest.”","Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi- Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500.

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Bhim Singh introduced a Private Member's Bill in the Upper House seeking to remove the words 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Constitution's Preamble, on Saturday.The MP said these terms were added 'undemocratically' during the Emergency in 1976 through the 42nd amendment under Indira Gandhi's government, when opposition leaders were imprisoned.Singh introduced The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the Rajya Sabha, arguing these words were not part of the original Constitution adopted in 1949.""I have introduced a Private Member's Bill to amend the Preamble of the Constitution, to remove the words 'socialist' and 'secular'.

The Trump administration has moved to sharply curtail the validity of work permits issued to refugees, asylees and several categories of immigrants—including those awaiting green cards—marking another major tightening of the country’s immigration system.The new policy, announced recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), reduces Employment Authorization Document (EAD) validity from the current five years to just 18 months for multiple categories of applicants.USCIS said the step is aimed at enabling more frequent vetting following recent security concerns, arguing that shorter validity periods will allow officials to screen applicants more often. This will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens (foreign nationals) with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies. After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens. ” said Joseph Edlow, director, USCIS.In addition, late on Friday, USCIS made another announcement relating to the establishment of a specialized unit, headquartered in Atlanta, to strengthen the ability of officials to screen out terrorists, criminal aliens, and other foreign nationals who pose potential threats to public safety or who have committed fraud or other crimes.Immigration attorneys say the move to reduce the validity period of EADs could trigger widespread disruption, especially for thousands of Indians in the employment-based green card backlog who rely on these work permits to continue working while their adjustment-of-status applications (from non-immigrant visas like H-1Bs to green card) remain pending.In the context of the Indian diaspora based in the US, Kripa Upadhyay, immigration attorney with Buchalter, a law firm said, “The primary impact of this will be on the following groups of Indian applicants who are transiting to a green card: Investors seeking adjustment of status based on a pending I-526/EB-5 application (this relates to the investment linked green card program); parents or spouses of US Citizens seeking adjustment of status in the US and employees in the US who are seeking adjustment based on approved I-140 and available visas. ”For H-1Bs seeking an adjustment of status, she said the change will “leave people in a terrible situation,” with many now needing to file renewals several months in advance to avoid job interruptions. “One cannot work without valid work authorization, so the risk of falling out of lawful employment becomes very real,” she said.The problem is compounded as applications for EAD renewals can typically be filed only 180 days before the expiry of the existing work authorisation permit, whereas processing of the renewal application can take much longer.The move will also impact American employers, as delays in processing of renewals of EADs, especially of key employees, could disrupt projects. Compliance costs will also increase for sponsoring employers.","The new policy, announced recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), reduces Employment Authorization Document (EAD) validity from the current five years to just 18 months for multiple categories of applicants.

NEW DELHI: At least 25 people were killed and six others injured after a massive fire broke out shortly after midnight on Sunday at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa. Police initially confirmed 23 deaths but later revised the toll to 25.A police spokesperson said the deceased included four tourists and 14 staff members, while the identities of seven others are yet to be established. Six injured persons are undergoing treatment at Goa Medical College and Hospital in Bambolim.According to eyewitnesses, the nightclub was jam-packed with around 100 people on the dance floor when the fire broke out shortly after midnight on Sunday. In the panic that followed, many rushed downstairs and ended up in the kitchen on the ground floor, where they were trapped along with staff members.State police said the blaze was triggered by a cylinder blast, but some eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of those who died were kitchen workers, including three women, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said. He added that ""three to four tourists"" were among the victims.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad told PTI.She said some tourists, in the confusion, ran to the kitchen area and got trapped, while ""many managed to run out of the club.""The fire spread rapidly because the club had temporary construction made up of palm leaves, which caught fire instantly. The venue, located in the backwaters of the Arpora river, had narrow entry and exit routes, making evacuation and rescue difficult. Fire brigades could not reach the club due to the lanes and had to park about 400 metres away.According to PTI senior fire and emergency services officer said the narrow access ""made controlling the blaze a challenging task.""The nightclub's location in the backwaters of the Arpora river, with a narrow approach road, made rescue difficult. Fire tenders could not reach the club because of the lanes, forcing crews to park nearly 400 metres away.A Fire and Emergency Services official said the narrow access ""made controlling the blaze a challenging task.""Goa CM Pramod Sawant said that managers of the club and others have already been arrested, and an arrest warrant has been issued against the owners.""This is an unfortunate day. For the first time in Goa’s tourism history, such a big incident of fire has occurred. 25 people died. I reached the spot at 1.30–2 am… Fire was doused within half an hour, but some people could rush out of it, and some others could not,"" Sawant told ANI.He confirmed several victims died of suffocation, and said, ""As per preliminary information, four people were tourists, and the rest were employees at the club. I express my condolences… May the soul of the deceased rest in peace.""Sawant said the government will provide compensation, and the six injured are receiving the ""best medical treatment"" at Goa Medical College. ""I have spoken with the Dean of the College. We have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. What permissions the club obtained and who granted them will be inquired into,"" he added.The CM said authorities must determine whether fire safety norms and building construction norms were followed. Speaking to PTI, Sawant confirmed that an FIR has been lodged against the nightclub’s owner and general manager.""An arrest warrant has been issued against the club owners.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta on Sunday, reacting to protests over over rising pollution levels, said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.Speaking at an event in Delhi Pitampura, the chief minister said, “Those who make big statements and protest at India Gate… pollution is not something that appeared today, it has been a problem for years. What did the previous government do? Where were you at that time? This is a backlog of 27 years. The government needs at least 27 months to clear the backlog of 27 years.""Her comments came after a series of demonstrations across the city, including one at India Gate where several people were detained during a “clean air protest.” The protesters demanded urgent action and stronger policies to deal with what they called an “air emergency.” Some women brought their children carrying nebulisers and medical prescriptions, using them as symbolic reminders of the growing health impact of Delhi’s smog.Police have detained at least 15 people in connection with the protests. A senior officer said the group refused to disperse and allegedly used pepper spray on personnel, triggering a brief scuffle.Meanwhile, this November has turned out to be one of the most polluted months in recent years for the Delhi–NCR region. All of India’s 10 most polluted cities were located in the area, with Ghaziabad at the top of the list and Delhi ranked fourth. Except for Bahadurgarh in Haryana, none of these cities recorded a single day of clean air, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The findings also highlighted how pollution in NCR is interconnected, with emissions in one city affecting air quality across the region.Delhi recorded a monthly average PM2.5 concentration of 215 µg/m³ — double the October average of 107 µg/m³. The capital logged 23 ‘very poor’ air days and six ‘severe’ days, underscoring the intensity of the winter smog cycle.",Delhi CM Rekha Gupta said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

KOLKATA: The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised. But, between 28 lakh and 30 lakh voters will, in all probability, have to attend poll officials’ hearings if they want to stay on the rolls as they remain unmapped (data not matching with the 2002 roll).All these unmapped voters will get notices to appear for in-person hearings and will have to produce one of the 13 SIR documents that EC has approved for Bengal. The hearings will be held between Dec 16 and Feb 7 next year before the publication of the final electoral rolls on Feb 14. Besides this number, till Saturday afternoon, 54.6 lakh voters remained untraceable or were categorised as dead or duplicate. These names will be deleted from the SIR draft list to be published on Dec 16, officials said. EC’s deadline to complete this phase of SIR ends Thursday.“A little over 7% (54.6 lakh) of the 99.4% digitised enumeration forms are now ‘uncollectible’ and these names will not be included in the draft SIR roll,” a senior EC official said. But voters can challenge and file fresh enrolment applications under Form 6 if they want to challenge this. Around 23.7 lakh voters have died, 19 lakh have shifted, 10.1 lakh are untraceable, and 1.2 lakh are duplicate voters. EC will publish a separate list of voters who have collected forms but are yet to return them to BLOs. These names (around 39,000), too, will not be included in draft rolls.","The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised.

Cabbies double fares; pvt bus operators come to rescue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabbies-double-fares-pvt-bus-operators-come-to-rescue/articleshow/125798323.cms,"Chandigarh/Nagpur: With major flight disruptions continuing for the third consecutive day, taxi operators in Chandigarh are driving away with the moolah. All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000. Fares on Nagpur-Bengaluru route showed a hike, but there seemed to be little to no inflation for other destinations like Pune and Hyderabad.","All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues' Many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - had to book last-minute taxis.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

PANAJI: Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub at northern Goa's Arpora located approximately 16km from Panaji, was constructed on a salt pan with inadequate safety measures, highlighting significant infrastructure concerns following a Saturday night fire incident that claimed 25 lives.The establishment, marketed as Goa's first island club, faces scrutiny over its safety protocols and building design. The nightclub is positioned in the middle of a salt pan, surrounded by water, with its entrance 50m from the main gate.While two entry points exist, typically only one narrow lane remains accessible.The club's basement features a thick concrete structure with a permanently closed exit. It houses the kitchen, changing room, and bar counter without proper ventilation, accessed by two narrow staircases.During rescue operations, emergency responders encountered difficulties accessing the basement area due to the narrow passageways, particularly concerning given the high number of kitchen staff working in the space.The first floor of the club, designated for live performances and club events, is enclosed by thick glass with minimal ventilation.While equipped with two exits, only one was operational during the incident.The venue regularly hosts various events attracting over 200 attendees on the first floor, which features open seating arrangements.""Of the three exits, only one was open at the time of the rescue operation,"" said Nitin Raiker, director of fire and emergency services.The club's limited accessibility is further compounded by its isolated location on the salt pan, with a single narrow lane typically serving as the sole access point to the night club.",Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub at northern Goa's Arpora located approximately 16km from Panaji.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

Obstructed exits trapped victims: Official

PANAJI: The Birch by Romeo Lane had been dancing with danger for long.The inferno was the result of a critical failure in ""fire prevention engineering, regulatory compliance, and life safety preparedness"" by club owners. The nightclub also lacked a construction licence.""According to records, the establishment did not obtain a valid NOC from the fire department, indicating non-compliance with mandatory fire safety regulations,"" fire department director Nitin Raiker said. The list of violations included the absence of functional fire alarm systems, non-installation of automatic sprinkler systems, lack of smoke extraction and basement ventilation systems, inadequate number and width of emergency exits, absence of illuminated exit signage, lack of emergency lighting, lack of fire compartmentalisation or fire-rated doors, and lack of evacuation plans.The fire department noted that the absence of “fundamental fire safety infrastructure” and unauthorised hazardous external activities significantly contributed to the severity of the blaze and the tragic loss of lives.“Prima facie observations also indicate that firework activities were being undertaken on the external frontage of the premises at the relevant time.This activity significantly increased ignition risk. Fireworks near commercial establishments, without proper isolation distances and permits, present a severe and unacceptable fire risk,” fire department director Nitin Raiker said.While the emergency response was timely, the narrow access routes complicated firefighting efforts, Raiker said. “It was further observed that the basement had inadequate ventilation and obstructed means of egress, which contributed to the entrapment of the victims,” he added.The department called for immediate enforcement of compliance measures, strict regulation of high-risk activities, and implementation of modern fire engineering solutions to prevent the recurrence of such accidents.“In one word, there were zero fire safety measures,” a fire department official said.","The inferno was the result of a critical failure in ""fire prevention engineering, regulatory compliance, and life safety preparedness"" by club owners.

MUMBAI: The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, long seen as a launchpad for India's brightest startups, has quietly crossed an even more telling milestone. It incorporated a company of its own. This is not an incubated spinoff or a faculty-seeded venture, but an organisation owned and anchored by IIT Bombay itself.On Nov 7, 2025, BharatGen Technology Foundation was registered with the Registrar of Companies in Mumbai, carrying the Powai institution's address as its own-an unmistakable signal of how India's top engineering school plans to shape the future of artificial intelligence.BharatGen, the country's first attempt to build a Large Language Model that mirrors India's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity, first took shape last year after the Department of Science and Technology (DST) laid the groundwork with Rs 235 crore in initial support, signalling an early bet on public infrastructure for AI.The project is supported under the DST's National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS). Led by IIT Bombay, the BharatGen consortium brings together several leading institutions, including IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Mandi, IIT Hyderabad, IIM Indore, IIT Kharagpur, and IIIT Delhi.""To take the models from the lab to market requires the functional freedom and autonomy of a corporation as opposed to being just an academic project,"" said Prof Ganesh Ramakrishnan, IIT Bombay's professor who is the founder director of BharatGen Technology Foundation Designed to work across more than 22 Indian languages, BharatGen combines text, speech, and document vision, so AI can interpret information the way citizens naturally speak, read, or interact.BharatGen's ambition is not just to build large language models, but to build ones that sound and think like India. Its strength, said Prof Ramakrishna, lies in training systems on home-grown datasets and Indian languages-an approach he believes will make them far more dependable in real-world use.He added that the foundation plans to release distilled versions of its models to developers, allowing startups and enterprises to plug into sovereign AI without the cost or expertise of training colossal systems on their own. In other words, hesaid, BharatGen will do the heavy lifting so the country's innovators can get straight to building.The initiative has now received an additional Rs 1,058 crore from MeitY under the IndiaAI Mission, expanding BharatGen into a national sovereign AI effort.","BharatGen is the country's first attempt to build a Large Language Model that mirrors India's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity.

New

border connectivity projects

lifelines for security, economy &

: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Inaugurating 125 border infrastructure projects, including the key Shyok tunnel in Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said they will not only ensure faster mobility of troops & weapons, but also boost tourism, employment & stronger faith in democracy among people living in remote regions.The projects, the highest number to be inaugurated simultaneously, will significantly improve last-mile connectivity to remote villages & forward military locations, ensuring uninterrupted movement through landslide and avalanche-prone areas.From the site of the 920-metre Shyok tunnel on the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie Road in Ladakh, Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated 28 roads, 93 bridges & four other projects spread across Ladakh, J&K, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Mizoram, which were completed at a total cost of Rs 5,000 crore by Border Roads Organisation.He also inaugurated the Galwan War Memorial.Noting the Modi government’s “unwavering commitment” to keep strengthening border infrastructure & developing border areas in line with the vision of Viksit Bharat, Singh said these connectivity projects are lifelines for security, economy & disaster management. The speed with which India is strengthening its borders with roads, tunnels, smart-fencing, integrated command centres and surveillance systems is proof that connectivity is a backbone of security, and not a separate entity, he said.“Our government, armed forces and organisations like the BRO are working diligently for holistic development of our border areas. We must continue strengthening the bond between the border regions andthe national mainstream so that the relationship is not influenced by any external factors,” he said.Referring to the successful conduct of Operation Sindoor, he said, “Our armed forces launched the operation in response to the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Everybody knows what befell those terrorists. We could have done much more, but our forces, demonstrating both courage and patience, only did only what was necessary.”“Such a massive operation was possible due to our strong connectivity. Logistics were delivered to the armed forces in a timely manner. Our connectivity with the border areas was maintained, making the operation a historic success,” he added.","The projects, the highest number to be inaugurated simultaneously, will significantly improve last-mile connectivity to remote villages & forward military locations.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

23 died in basement ‘due to suffocation’, 2 bodies found on stairs

PANAJI: Tragedy struck Goa's popular after-hours party scene just before midnight on Saturday, killing 25 people - five of them tourists - and injuring six inside a nightclub in Arpora that turned into a fireball within seconds of electric firecrackers hitting the wooden ceiling of the first floor as a belly-dancer performed.The victims in the blaze at Birch by Romeo Lane, 16km from Panaji, included four of a family from UP's Ghaziabad. Of the injured, five are being treated at Goa Medical College and Hospital. Police said 150 guests were at the club for the weekend event.DGP Alok Kumar said four club staffers - chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, and general manager Vivek Singh - were arrested. Goa Police registered an FIR against the club's Delhi-based owners, Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, charging them with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team is in Delhi with a warrant to arrest the duo.CM Pramod Sawant said his government instituted a magisterial inquiry to find out the lapses that resulted in the tragedy and submit a report within a week.The BJP govt also suspended three officials - ex-director of panchayats Siddhi Halarnkar, ex-state pollution control board member secretary Shamila Monteiro, and former Arpora-Nagoa panchayat secretary Reghuvir Bagkar - for allegedly allowing the nightclub to function without adhering to safety norms.The blaze occurred around 11.45 pm, with a portion of the ceiling catching fire. As flames coursed through the roof overhead, the guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, those trapped inside reached the basement after the exit caught fire.CM Pramod Sawant said the chief secretary and DGP Alok Kumar would initiate disciplinary action against the suspended officials. The CM dismissed initial suspicion of a cylinder blast, saying a preliminary investigation by police and fire services department suggested electric firecrackers triggered the blaze. ""The fire spread quickly because of the wooden ceiling,"" he said.Of the victims, 23 died in the basement of suspected suffocation. Police found the bodies in a pile. Two charred bodies were on the staircase. The basement does not have ventilation.Sawant said except for the five tourists who died, the deceased were employees of the club - from Assam, Bengal, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, UP and Nepal. Postmortem was conducted on 17 bodies by evening; five were handed over to families. State government sealed Romeo Lane at Vagator, a nightclub belonging to the same owners, after an inquiry revealed inadequate fire-safety measures.PM Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh in ex gratia to the next of kin of each of the deceased, and Rs 50,000 each to the injured.CM Sawant separately declared Rs 5 lakh in compensation for each death and Rs 50,000 to the injured.","Five of the 25 people killed were tourists from Uttar Pradesh and Nepal.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will initiate a discussion on Monday in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram, in what will be an extension of the increasingly fiery ideological battle between BJP and its opponents over the journey of India's national song, a rallying cry during the Congress-led freedom struggle, but whose evocative cultural theme is central to the governing party's political idiom.Defence minister Rajnath Singh from BJP and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Gaurav Gogoi of Congress will be speaking on the issue, which has long animated BJP's base steeped in cultural nationalism.Ten hours each have been assigned for the debate in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, where it is scheduled for Tuesday and home minister Amit Shah will be BJP's main speaker.Sparks seemed set to fly, with BJP sources saying many important and unknown facets related to Vande Mataram will be brought before the nation during the discussion, signalling the party's determined bid to put Congress in a dock over the patriotic song, which is interwoven with India's freedom struggle.Congress has, on the other hand, cited Rabindranath Tagore's support for pruning of the immortal composition to two stanzas to defend Jawaharlal Nehru who accepted it because of both difficulty in understanding the stanzas following the first two, and objections of Muslims.Modi had recently set the tone of the discussion by accusing Congress of dropping in 1937 the stanzas of the song written by noted Bengali writer Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, saying it sowed the seeds of Partition and that such a divisive mindset remains a challenge to the country.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed Sunday Nehru's ""reality"" will be exposed during the debate. He also cited historical text to train guns at Nehru, noting the first PM had contended that Vande Mataram's association with Anandmath, a novel written by Chatterjee, is likely to""irritate"" Muslims and that he found the song's language difficult to understand.Chatterjee's association with the song and its strong endorsement by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will come handy for BJP in its bid to put TMC on the defensive on the issue of Bengali identity as it prepares for the assembly polls in West Bengal, slated to be held next year.Congress and other BJP rivals like TMC and Samajwadi Party may turn to the alleged indifference of BJP's ideological mentor RSS to the freedom struggle, besides the stand of Hindutva figures on some of the symbols of Indian nationalism at that time to target the government.Muslim League's strident opposition to Vande Mataram because of its evocative Hindu cultural themes, including reverential reference to deities, had led to the song's adoption to its first two paras by Congress, the trigger behind Modi's recent attack on the party. The opposition party, however, argued it was done on Tagore's suggestions. Several orthodox Muslim bodies and politicians have, however, remained critical of the song.The debate will be followed by a discussion in both Houses on ""election reforms"", a broader term to cover what will be essentially a war of words between the government and opposition parties over the SIR of electoral rolls.",PM Narendra Modi will initiate a discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.

Thermal maps for daily choices: SatLeo tests street-level heat intelligence in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thermal-maps-for-daily-choices-satleo-tests-street-level-heat-intelligence-in-karnataka/articleshow/125821186.cms,"Thermal maps for daily choices: SatLeo tests street-level heat intelligence in Karnataka

BENGALURU: On a summer morning, or any other day, an app might soon guide a courier or gig worker along a route not because it is shortest but because it is coolest. That is the idea behind Ahmedabad Space startup SatLeo Labs’ thermal mapping, which uses space-borne temperature data to help with everyday decisions, from where a city plants its next tree to how a worker plans a trip on a 40°C afternoon.The idea is already being tested. In Tumakuru, 76km from Bengaluru, SatLeo’s pilot uses drone-mounted thermal sensors paired with satellite-derived layers to spot methane leaks and track heat build-up across a 40-acre solid-waste dump.“Tumakuru is moving toward a cleaner and healthier future. With new technologies like thermal intelligence via satellites and drones, we can now see and solve problems faster, whether it is greenhouse gas emissions above solid waste, heat patterns of the city, or open dumps. This project is about making Tumakuru safer, greener, and more comfortable for every citizen,” Ashwija BV, MD & CEO, Tumakuru Smart City Limited, and commissioner, Tumakuru City Corporation, said.SatLeo’s pitch is to build a thermometer for Earth. Co-founder & CEO Shravan Bhati says current datasets smooth out the sharp differences in temperature that define a city. “There’s no accurate temperature information of each and every spot.Existing datasets are interpolated averages; they hide the fact that a park can be several degrees cooler than an industrial block a few hundred metres away,” he told TOI.SatLeo plans a constellation, with its experimental Tapas-1 mission slated for Q1 2026 and a commercial rollout expected later that year. It aims to blend medium-wave and long-wave infrared imaging with 2.5-metre visible imagery and onboard edge computing. The goal is to offer sub-10-metre thermal maps, twice-daily updates and real-time anomaly detection, giving cities and enterprises processed insights rather than large volumes of raw data.One of these products, the “Thermal Comfort API”, is a layer that municipalities or platforms can plug into their systems to measure heat stress at street level. The Tumakuru pilot shows two useful applications.First is landfill emissions. IoT sensors can tell officials how much methane exists, but they cannot identify the exact point of release across a wide dump. Thermal layers help narrow the location to specific pockets so that teams can tackle the problem without searching tens of acres.Second is urban heat. With thermal layers, the city can plan plantations, shade structures and water supply where they will have the most effect. SatLeo’s data has been used in Tumakuru for several months, and the firm is speaking to other municipalities about similar projects.SatLeo also sees a wider market in outdoor labour management. Bhati points out that average city temperatures say little about the conditions faced by gig workers or those in construction. With street-level thermal maps, insurers could verify claims linked to heat exposure, employers could redirect or reschedule tasks during spikes, and health departments could position cooling stations or medicines more precisely.“If the temperature is going above 48°C and up, then the person is insured… but who will make sure where the people were working that the temperature of that location was 48°C?” Bhati asked, stressing the usefulness of their approach.Co-founder Urmil Bakhai says the roadmap is ambitious but grounded, noting that the firm has letters of intent worth $25 million from public and private players. The appeal for city managers is clear: targeted action is cheaper and quicker than broad schemes. For residents and workers, the benefit is straightforward — cooler routes, better-placed trees and quicker detection of harmful emissions.","SatLeo Labs’ thermal mapping uses space-borne temperature data to help with everyday decisions.

SRINAGAR: A 29-year-old Chinese national was questioned by police and intelligence officials in central Kashmir’s Budgam district Sunday for travelling to J&K and Ladakh without permission and violating visa norms, a police official said.The man, who was found staying at a homestay in the area, told interrogators that he had also visited the Zanskar region as a tourist. He claimed his father is a businessman in China and said he had watched films like The Kashmir Files and Article 370. He also said he was looking for books on Kashmir, including Curfewed Night by Basharat Peer.He was later released, the official said, adding that he may be called again for questioning and could be deported for violating visa regulations.The Chinese national arrived in New Delhi on November 19 on a tourist visa permitting travel only to select Buddhist religious destinations, including Varanasi, Agra, New Delhi, Sarnath, and Gaya.However, he flew to Leh on November 20 and did not register himself at foreigners' regional registration office counter at Leh airport.",29-year-old Chinese national questioned for travelling to J&K and Ladakh without permission and violating visa norms.

New rules to make drunk-driving checks more reliable from April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-rules-to-make-drunk-driving-checks-more-reliable-from-april/articleshow/125820772.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Beginning April, breath analysers, used to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of drivers or employees, will be required to comply with the newly notified norms issued by the consumer affairs department. The updated standards aim at enhancing accuracy, consistency and credibility of the devices, which play a critical role in law enforcement and workplace safety.Under the revised norms, breath analysers must meet strict limits on permissible error and incorporate a built-in printing mechanism.Significantly, the device will not operate if the printing paper is missing, ensuring that every test conducted is accompanied by a printed record for verification and legal use. Moreover, the device will display only the final measurement result, reducing chances of misinterpretation or tampering during testing.Officials said these measures seek to bolster public trust in the fairness and accuracy of enforcement actions related to drunk driving and workplace safety.The updated devices are designed to deliver rapid and reliable readings, enabling police officers and authorised personnel to make swift, well-informed decisions during checks.This is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of roadside enforcement operations.The norms fall under the amended Legal Metrology Rules, which also outline procedures for verification and scheduled re-verification of instruments. Regular checks will ensure that breath analysers remain accurate throughout their lifecycle and during field use.Traffic police across major cities have increasingly relied on breath analysers to curb drunk driving, especially during late-night patrols and holiday seasons.Road safety experts emphasised that the standardisation of these devices was long overdue, noting that inconsistent readings have often been challenged in courts. The new norms, they said, will help reduce disputes, strengthen prosecution in drunk-driving cases, and contribute to safer roads nationwide.","Breathalysers must meet strict limits on permissible error and incorporate a built-in printing mechanism.

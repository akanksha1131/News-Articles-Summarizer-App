‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Tuesday apprised the Election Commission about partial compliance of the commission's directions pending with the state govt—including filing of FIRs against four officers for violation of data security and suspension of the Basirhat assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) — within the Feb 17, 5.30 pm deadline set by the poll panel.However, compliance remains pending as regards EC direction dated Feb 13 to Chakravorty for cancellation of transfer orders issued by the state govt in respect of three electoral roll observers—Aswini Kumar yadav, Randhir Kumar, and Smita Pandey—without prior consultation with the poll panel. Also, the state govt is yet to send a proposal regarding appointment of returning officers (ROs) and electoral registration officer (EROs) as per criteria laid down by EC.The norms require them to be officers at the level of sub divisional magistrate (SDM), sub divisional officer (SDO) or revenue divisional officer. At present, ROs in only 67 of the state’s 294 assembly constituencies (ACs) and EROs in only 68 ACs are of the rank of SDO/SDM.Confirming receipt of the compliance letter from West Bengal chief secretary on Tuesday, EC sources told TOI that the commission, which is currently on a visit to Assam, ""shall examine the letter upon its return here"".Meanwhile, the West Bengal chief electoral officer, in a post on X on Tuesday, said he had suspended three micro observers, based on reports of EC-appointed district electoral roll observers. ""Electoral roll micro observers being under deputation to ECI are directed to perform their duties diligently and not to outsource/delegate their work to anyone else, failing which they will be liable for the consequences,"" he posted.Only on Sunday, the EC had suspended seven AEROs in the state with immediate effect, over ""dereliction of duty"".During its meeting with West Bengal chief secretary here last week, EC had asked the state administration to comply with its directions regarding payment of honorarium to BLOs, appointment of suitable SIR/poll-related officers, rescinding of unilateral transfer of roll observers and registration of FIRs against errant officers, latest by 5.30 pm on Feb 17.The February 17, 5.30 pm deadline set by EC, however, was not in respect of the pending honorarium dues.","West Bengal chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Tuesday apprised the Election Commission about partial compliance of the commission's directions pending with the state govt.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday reiterated that Hindu families should consider having at least three children.Addressing a social-harmony meeting at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Lucknow, Bhagwat expressed concerns over what he described as a declining Hindu population and called for uniting and empowering the Hindu society.""There is a need to unite and empower Hindus. There is no threat to us but vigilance is necessary,"" Bhagwat said.Raising concerns over infiltration, Bhagwat said infiltrators should be ""detected, deleted and deported"", and should not be provided employment.He also said Hindu families should consider having at least three children, citing scientific opinions that societies with an average fertility rate of below three could disappear in the future.Bhagwat said newly-married couples should be made aware of this and added that the purpose of marriage is to carry forward creation, not merely fulfilling one's own desires.He said a lack of harmony leads to discrimination and stressed that all citizens share one country and one motherland.""The Sanatan thought is a philosophy of harmony,"" Bhagwat said, adding that differences that have emerged over time must be addressed through understanding and practice.Responding to a question on University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, Bhagwat said laws must be obeyed and if a law is flawed, there are constitutional ways to change it.He said caste divisions should not become a cause of conflict and called for uplifting the disadvantaged with a sense of belonging.Bhagwat said India would guide the world in the near future and that solutions to many global problems lie within the country's civilisational ethos.He said regular community-level meetings should promote social harmony, remove misconceptions and address social issues, while extending support to the weaker sections of the society.The RSS chief cautioned that some elements in the United States and China are working against India's social harmony, and called for vigilance and mutual trust.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat says Hindu families should consider having at least three children.

AHMEDABAD: Aspirations to walk tall and proud in khaki have ""shrunk"" after running into a tape measure.Several police job hopefuls in Gujarat have moved the high court after failing to rise to one's full height in the latest recruitment drive, falling below the mandatory 165cm (5.4ft) cut-off despite, reportedly, having earlier cleared the same benchmark.Confusion surfaced during the physical efficiency test, where candidates who had been measured at or above 165cm during a recruitment drive in 2024 were declared ineligible. Authorities, recently, said aspirants now fall short of the record.Among the petitioners: Tushar Bhaliya and Govind Sindhav of Gandhinagar, Pappu Parmar of Banaskantha, and Mukesh Chauhan of Ahmedabad. All had reapplied for different police posts and were previously cleared on height. This time, they got the short end of the stick.As petitions piled up before HC, Justice Nirzar Mehta added a filter: each petitioner must deposit Rs 10,000 with court registry, refundable if claim were correct.To settle the inches-versus-centimetres debate, HC ordered for a fresh measurement to be conducted under strict medical supervision.Candidates must appear Feb 19 at GMERS civil hospital in Sola, carrying proof of deposit. Concerned Hospital authorities have been directed to arrange the process and facilitate it.Transparency is non-negotiable in the process.

Yunus Rakes Up India's 'Seven Sisters' In Exit Speech, Hails Bangladesh's Ties With China

'New World Order Emerging, India Ready To Lead As Global Growth Engine', Says PM Modi At ET Summit

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called upon the Indian IT sector to lead not just in service delivery but in building AI products, platforms and solutions that work for India and the world.""India's IT sector has been the backbone of our services exports and a key driver of economic growth. AI presents both a tremendous opportunity and a challenge for this sector... The fundamental shift is that AI isn't replacing the IT sector. It is transforming it,"" he told ANI.PM Narendra Modi said, ""While general-purpose AI tools have become widespread, enterprise-grade AI adoption is concentrated in specific sectors. Incumbent IT firms continue to play crucial roles in solving complex business problems.""Many saw the PM's remarks as nudging Indian software service players to develop new capabilities and work on products and platforms - something that many Indian IT companies are not known for despite sitting on large cash piles.

How do the fares of Vande Bharat chair car trains compare to similar trains around the world? According to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the ticket prices for the Vande Bharat chair car are much lower than such trains operating in countries such France, China, and Japan.Vande Bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019 and has since then expanded across the Indian Railways network. The self-propelled train set is said to be a world-class offering by the national transporter, allowing for better passenger amenities and faster train travel.Recently, Ashwini Vaishnaw informed the Lok Sabha that the fare for the Vande Bharat AC chair car for journeys covering around 300 to 400 kilometres is approximately Rs 2.19 per kilometre. This, he said, is significantly lower than comparable services in countries such as China, Japan and France.“The fare of Vande Bharat AC chair car over a journey between 300 and 400 kilometres is around Rs 2.19 per kilometre, which is much lower than the fares of similar segments of services in countries like China, Japan and France, where it ranges from Rs 7 to Rs 20 per kilometre,” Vaishnaw said.Also Read | How seven new high-speed rail corridors can transform train travel in India In his written reply, Vaishnaw said the Ministry of Railways determines passenger fares after considering multiple factors, including operational costs, the value and quality of services provided, the nature of facilities offered, affordability for passengers, competition from alternative modes of transport, and broader socio-economic considerations.Vande Bharat train services currently operate across 82 routes, running a total of 164 services. According to the minister, these trains function as a separate category within passenger services, featuring a different fare structure along with amenities such as improved suspension systems, quicker acceleration through semi-high-speed operations, automatic plug doors, ergonomic seating, mini pantry facilities, CCTV surveillance and the KAVACH safety system.Vaishnaw added that passenger affordability has remained a key consideration, and as a result, ticket prices for these trains have been maintained below the actual cost of providing the service.He further said, “The rationalised fare structure has facilitated the wider expansion of these services across the country, reflecting strong passenger demand for these services. Vande Bharat services have high occupancy level on all major routes with occupancy of Vande Bharat near 100 per cent, demonstrating a change in passenger preferences.”Commenting on fares in the ordinary class of other trains, Vaishnaw said these remain among the lowest when compared internationally.Drawing a comparison with neighbouring countries, he noted that the per-kilometre fare in India stands at about 20 paise, while the corresponding fares are 54 paise in Pakistan, 37 paise in Bangladesh and 51 paise in Sri Lanka.Recently a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat Express train has also been launched, and hundreds of such trains are planned for overnight train travel in the coming years.",Vande Bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019.

The absence of eit-her of these cornerstones wo-uld prevent judicial institutions from properly performing their critical duties.""The bench said, ""Our decisions as participants in the legal process, from laying down the procedure that shall have to be faced by common citizens to the final judgment passed in any given case, must reflect the ethos of compassion, humanity and understanding, which are essential for creating a fair and effective justice system.""SC said it had laid down principles to sensitise judges and so would refrain from taking an open-ended approach to devise fresh guidelines without guidance.

PM Modi, Emmanuel Macron Vow Strong India-France Anti Terror Front, Signals Big G7-BRICS Bridge

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday asked his French counterpart, minister of the armed forces and veterans affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, “to raise India-made component” in the upcoming deal for 114 Rafale fighter jets “by up to 50%”, defence sources told TOI.During their 6th India-France Annual Defence Dialogue in Bengaluru, Rajnath also told Vautrin to “try to ensure that the engines of the (fighter) planes are made and overhauled in India. This will help our ‘Make-in-India’ effort,” the sources quoted the minister as saying.The two ministers also discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues, including priority areas for co-development and co-production of defence equipment. India and France also renewed their defence cooperation agreement for another 10 years, announced reciprocal deployment of army officers, and inked a pact to manufacture Hammer missiles in India. An MoU on JV was signed for the manufacturing of Hammer missiles by defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited CMD and executive vice-president of Safran Electronics and Defence.Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and France’s Safran company will form a JV to produce Hammer precision-guided munitions, used during Operation Sindoor, in India.Earlier, Rajnath and Vautrin attended the inaugural ceremony of the H125 Light Utility Helicopter final assembly line, jointly built by Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) and Airbus at Karnataka’s Vemagal, when PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron virtually inaugurated the facility from Mumbai.After the facility inauguration, Modi said, “We take pride in the fact that, together, India and France will manufacture in India the world's only helicopter capable of flying to the heights of Mount Everest and export it to the entire world.” The delivery of the first ‘Made in India’ H125 is expected in early 2027 and the helicopter will help meet the requirements of the Indian armed forces for a light multi-role helicopter and will essentially contribute to army operations on the icy heights of the Himalayas. Rajnath said the total investment for the H125 project is expected to exceed Rs 1,000 crore and create direct and indirect employment.In the presence of Modi in Mumbai, Macron said, “From Rafale jets to submarines, we are expanding defence cooperation. India and France are also working together to build a helicopter assembly line and fifth-gen fighter jet engines.”The President’s remark came days after Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the go-ahead for purchase of 114 Rafale jets from France. After Tuesday’s meet between Modi and Macron, the cost negotiations between two sides for the upcoming Rafale deal will get a big push and the agreement will be inked after the Cabinet’s clearance in near future.With Macron also talking about defence collaboration on submarines, India may buy additional Scorpene-class conventional submarines from France. India had already acquired six Scorpene-class submarines (Kalvari class) from France under the Project 75 programme.The French defence minister appreciated the conversion of Exercise Shakti with the Army from biennial to an annual event.During the meeting, Rajnath also raised the issue of Pakistan terrorism. He said Pakistan has a long history of nurturing, nourishing, and promoting cross-border terrorism to create disturbance and violence in India. This, he said, has created a serious threat to peace in the region.","Rajnath Singh asked his French counterpart, minister of the armed forces and veterans affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, “to raise India-made component” in the upcoming deal for 114 Rafale fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday sharply criticised Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi over their opposition to the Great Nicobar island infrastructure project, accusing them of going to great lengths to derail it. The governing party cited the National Green Tribunal's nod to the initiative as a triumph of truth that foiled their disruptive attempts.Coal and mines minister G Kishan Reddy alleged, ""On directions from international collaborators, the mother-son duo of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been going to great lengths to derail the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project worth approximately Rs 80,000 crore.""India currently relies heavily on foreign ports for transshipment, he said, adding that the project aims to construct an international transshipment terminal, an international airport, a power plant and a township, leveraging its proximity to the Malacca Strait.""With this, another attempt by the Gandhis has failed,"" he said, referring to their opposition over alleged environmental damage.Sonia Gandhi, in a newspaper article last year, had called the project the making of ""an ecological disaster"" and a ""grave misadventure"" trampling tribal rights and legal processes.Echoing her, Rahul Gandhi said it underscores ""injustices inflicted on Nicobar's people and its delicate ecosystem"".The central govt has rejected the criticism, asserting the project will not harm or displace indigenous tribes and will help counter China's expansionist designs. Reddy said the proposed hub would cater to East-West cargo routes, emphasising the NGT's acknowledgement of safeguards.""As PM Narendra Modi dedicates his life to building a strong atmanirbhar and Viksit Bharat, many have tried to obstruct India's development journey. However, those opposing India will continue to fail,"" he said.","Sonia Gandhi had called the project the making of ""an ecological disaster"" and a ""grave misadventure"" Rahul Gandhi said it underscores ""injustices inflicted on Nicobar's people and its delicate ecosystem"" The central govt has rejected the criticism, asserting the project will not harm or displace indigenous tribes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128480208,imgsize-2297148,width-400,resizemode-4/great-nicobar-project.jpg"

NAGPUR: Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) Sunday raided 21 locations across multiple districts and busted an alleged radicalisation network operating under the garb of a soccer club. At the centre was a Nagpur-based grocer who allegedly used a club in Yavatmal's Pusad as a front to indoctrinate youth into 'jihadi' ideology.Preliminary findings indicated many suspects - projected as footballers - maintained contact with cross-border radical Islamic terror outfits. Intelligence sources said they were involved in online discussions promoting anti-India sentiments and pro-jihadi views. The grocer allegedly sent them, disguised as a football team, to radicalisation workshops in Kerala and West Bengal. Expensive flight tickets point to a well-organised, financially backed network aimed at grooming vulnerable youths through targeted meetings.

'World Recognises India’s AI Power': Norway To New Zealand Praise India As AI Impact Summit Begins

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Centre over mismanagement at the ongoing AI Impact Summit in the national capital. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge called it an example of “PR hungry” government that had turned a global opportunity into “utter chaos”.In a post on X, Kharge said that what could have been a major moment for India’s digital and artificial intelligence leadership had instead resulted in distress for participants.“What could have been a showpiece AI Summit for the entire world demonstrating the digital & AI capabilities of India, has reportedly turned into utter chaos and rank mismanagement by this ‘PR hungry’ government!” he wrote.The Congress chief alleged that founders, exhibitors and visitors faced multiple problems during the event, particularly on the first day.“Founders, exhibitors and visitors - all face extreme distress due to the PM gatecrashing for a photo opportunity on the very first day,” Kharge said.Listing the complaints, he added, “Exhibitors are left without food and water, their products are stolen, Digi Yatra miserably fails, laptops, personal electronic devices and even bags are prohibited, only cash instead of digital/UPI payment is accepted, and founders are made to pay huge sums without basic facilities, among many other reasons of distress.”Calling it an embarrassment for the country, Kharge said, “It is extremely unfortunate that, our country has to suffer this global embarassment due to the incompetancy of our own government.”He also suggested that the Centre take lessons from a state-level technology event. “Perhaps the Modi Govt should learn from the Bengaluru Tech Summit (BTS) which is an annual feature in smoothly organising such large scale Digital & Tech congregations,” he wrote.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw acknowledged the issue and assured that all problems will be addressed.""If any issue or inconvenience has come to exhibitors at AI Summit, we apologise for that. All issues will be addressed,"" Vaishnaw said.The AI Impact Summit, which began on Monday at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, is being described as the world’s largest artificial intelligence gathering. The five-day event, running from February 16 to 20, has drawn thousands of participants, including tech leaders, policymakers, startup founders and industry experts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the summit, which will also see the participation of more than 20 heads of state and government, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Technology leaders such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Google’s Sundar Pichai are also scheduled to attend.The summit aims to shape a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration” and focuses on themes of “People, Planet, and Progress”. India is positioning itself as a hub for digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence, and is expected to push for wider access to AI technologies and the creation of global AI commons.PTI reporters at the venue observed long queues outside session halls due to packed schedules and high demand. Organisers said that registrations exceeded expectations, reflecting growing global interest in AI infrastructure, enterprise adoption and governance.While there were reports of logistical challenges due to heavy footfall and parallel sessions running simultaneously, the event has seen strong participation, with panel discussions and exhibitions drawing large crowds.The government has highlighted the summit as an opportunity to showcase India’s digital public infrastructure, engineering talent and its ambitions to lead global conversations on responsible and inclusive AI development.",The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Centre over mismanagement at the ongoing AI Impact Summit in the national capital.

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah voiced a mix of hope and scepticism Tuesday after Union law minister Arjun Meghwal said a decision on restoring statehood to the Union territory would be announced “soon”, citing an assurance by home minister Amit Shah in Parliament.“One-and-a-half years have passed since an elected govt assumed office and we are still waiting,” Omar told reporters. “We hope we will not have to wait much longer.”Speaking after a function at Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre, Meghwal described statehood as “an important” and “very sensitive” question. “When the Union home minister has said in Parliament that you will get this right, then you will get it,” he said, adding that a process was underway.Omar said patience was wearing thin. “We will not be satisfied till we get it. The process is underway but it is taking far too long,” he said, adding that his govt remained in continuous engagement with Centre.The push comes nearly six years after Centre abrogated Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and split the former state into two UTs — J&K and Ladakh. On Dec 11, 2023, Supreme Court upheld the move while urging that J&K’s statehood be restored “as soon as possible”.Omar, who took office on Oct 16, 2024, has repeatedly raised the issue. On Aug 16 last year, he wrote to BJP and other parties, while urging Parliament to bring a bill to restore statehood.“The restoration must not be viewed as a concession,” his letter said, cautioning against a precedent where statehood becomes “a discretionary favour”. He said the delay carries implications for the country’s constitutional values and democratic ethos, citing the reduction of J&K’s status in 2019 and the prolonged wait for reversal.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah voiced a mix of hope and scepticism Tuesday.

Multiple aspects of plane crash raise apprehensions, says NCP

MUMBAI: Deputy CM Sunetra Pawar and other NCP members on Tuesday met CM Devendra Fadnavis and demanded a CBI probe into the Jan 28 air crash that killed Ajit Pawar NCP state chief Sunil Tatkare told reporters that the CM has assured them the state govt would communicate with the Union home ministry. ""The govt has already initiated a probe by independent agencies and has said it will order a CBI investigation. We feel a probe by the central agency would be comprehensive,"" Tatkare said. Sunetra Pawar, accompanied by her elder son Parth Pawar and others, handed over to the CM a letter seeking a CBI probe.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed in a crash in Baramati.In the letter, NCP stated, ""Multiple aspects surrounding the incident give rise to legitimate apprehensions requiring investigation by an independent central agency.""Among the ""substantial questions"" raised, the letter said, were the reported last-minute changes in flight crew composition which requires scrutiny of operational decision-making and authorisation, apparent anomalies concerning Air Traffic Control communications and sequencing of runway clearances, concerns regarding the functioning and integrity of critical onboard safety warning systems, absence of any recorded distress communication despite proximity to landing phase, and matters requiring forensic evaluation, including crew fitness, maintenance compliance, and aircraft systems.The party said that as the probe into the incident involves highly technical aviation, forensic, electronic, and operational considerations, the investigative powers, technical expertise, and inter-state jurisdictional capacity of CBI render it the most appropriate agency to conduct a comprehensive inquiry.A CBI probe would serve to reinforce confidence in the fairness and integrity of the investigative process and ensure that all aspects are examined without limitation, the letter stated.NCP highlighted that the nature of the incident transcends an ordinary accident and directly engages public confidence in aviation safety, regulatory oversight, and institutional accountability.The NCP legislature party is fully behind Sunetra Pawar and there is no dissent, Tatkare said.He said BJP state chief Ravindra Chavan met him at the NCP office and discussed the way forward for the Mahayuti alliance after its victory in the zilla parishad polls. He also said incidents such as bribery in NCP minister Narhari Zirwal's office malign the image of govt and ministers.","NCP state chief Sunil Tatkare said the state govt would communicate with the Union home ministry.

At Kota academy, twins turned every test into a private contest

MUMBAI/JAIPUR: In a city crowded with toppers and tight schedules, brothers Mahroof Ahmed Khan and Masroor Ahmed Khan in Kota stand out for an almost uncanny symmetry. The twins, who share the same shoe size and eyeglass power, studied together, tested together, sat the same JEE Main (Session-I) 2026 shift, and walked away with identical marks till the last digit - 285 out of 300; an NTA score of 99.998.Under NTA rules, candidates must declare if they are twins while filling out forms for the same competitive exam. Such candidates are made to take the exam in the same shift to ensure the integrity of exams like JEE and NEET. Their story began in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and moved, like so many other JEE journeys, to Kota in 2023.Known for cracking Olympiad exams, the twin brothers hoped the city's coaching ecosystem would sharpen them for bigger tests ahead, and turned friendly rivalry into a full-time study tool.""The twins came here sharing not just classrooms and notes, but an entire rhythm of preparation. Born on May 7, 2008, they have moved in parallel lines for as long as they can remember - same school, same coaching, same ambition,"" said Prof Amit Ahuja, career counsellor at Allen Career Institute. Behind this effort was a decision that reshaped the family's life.Their mother, Dr Zeenat Begum, a gynaecologist who had been working for Odisha govt since the 1990s, put her career on hold to move to Kota with her sons.For three years, she managed their routines, meals, health, and morale, becoming the quiet constant in a high-pressure environment.Zeenat said the move to Kota was initially meant to be temporary. ""Both of them got selected for the International Science Olympiad in 2023, and we came to Kota in March that year, thinking we would stay for a few months till they prepared for the Olympiad exam. But after a few weeks, both said that they liked the environment and the study approach here and decided to pursue coaching for JEE,"" she said. ""When they decided to pursue a career in engineering and prepare in Kota for JEE, I left my job as I thought that if their career was made, I too could restart mine. But supporting them is important in this phase,"" Zeenat said.At the academy, the twins found their competitive edge not in outpacing others, but in pushing each other. If one slipped, the other stepped in - dissecting mistakes, revising concepts, and resetting goals.At home, the competition stayed strictly in-house. Their mother said the twins competed only as a preparation strategy, calling each other their ""friend"" and ""mirror"". ""They would study and give exams together and compare their scores with each other and with their previous attempts. It helped them identify their weaknesses, and they worked to improve them. This mutual competition is their greatest strength,"" said Zeenat.","Mahroof Ahmed Khan and Masroor Ahmed Khan share the same shoe size and eyeglass power.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat's electoral strength contracted 13.4% to 4.4 crore voters on completion of a special intensive revision (SIR) that saw 77 lakh-odd names being deleted from the 2025 rolls and 9.5 lakh new electors getting added to the final list published Tuesday.The double-digit percentage decline caps two rounds of scrutiny, starting with 73.7 lakh deletions when the draft rolls were published last Dec after updating mortality records, migration data and incorrect registrations. Another 3.9 lakh names were removed before the final rolls were put out. Between the publication of the draft and final rolls, the electorate expanded 1.3%, a large section of them first-time voters.Around 40 lakh voters in the unrevised 2025 rolls were found to have permanently shifted, 18 lakh were dead, 9.8 lakh couldn't be traced to their registered addresses, and 3.8 lakh had duplicate voter cards.Another 1.9 lakh voters' names in Gujarat were omitted for other reasons. Based on objections and further verification after the draft rolls were published, another 3.9 lakh names were deleted from the rolls.Ahmedabad topped the state with 49.1 lakh voters in the final rolls, up from 48 lakh in the draft list. The district also recorded the highest number of additions at 1.5 lakh new electors. In percentage terms, Dang registered the highest proportional increase at 2.15%, although its total voter base stands at 1.9 lakh. Other districts with notable percentage growth were Porbandar (2.1%), Jamnagar (2%), Botad (1.9%), Chhota Udepur (1.9%) and Gandhinagar (1.8%).Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot reported substantial additions, reflecting migration patterns and youth enrolment.

NEW DELHI: SC on Tuesday criticised 12 'eminent' persons who together filed a PIL ""targeting"" CMs of BJP-governed states for alleged hate speeches while making a plea for framing guidelines to restrain constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats from breaching fidelity to constitutional morality.Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices BV Nagarathna and Joymalya Bagchi that the country's atmosphere had become toxic and ""it is only the SC which can and should remedy it.""However, the CJI-led bench was quick to point out that the petition had selectively named individuals while highlighting the problem. ""This petition is definitely targeting certain individuals as it leaves out others who routinely make such hate speeches. Let the petitioners not create an impression that it is targeting certain individuals.""The petitioners, including Roop Rekha Verma, Mohd Adeep, Harsh Mander, Najeeb Jung, John Dayal and Ashok Kumar Sharma had cited the alleged hate speeches of Himanta Biswa Sarma, Yogi Adityanath, Devendra Fadnavis, Pushkar Singh Dhami, Anantkumar Hegde and Giriraj Singh, all of whom belong to BJP, in addition to certain remarks by some bureaucrats.""Come with an impartial and neutral petition. The issue is important. Ultimately, there must be restraint in speech from all sides. We would like to say all political party functionaries must be mindful of constitutional morality and exercise restraint in their speeches, and any guideline should be applicable across the board,"" said the CJI.The bench said there are political parties which brazenly make speeches based on their communal ideology and openly profess hatred. ""You have not cited a single example from the other side.""When Sibal said he would delete all references to individuals in the petition, the bench responded that it would hear the PIL after the necessary amendments are carried out.Justice Nagarathna said, ""Political party leaders must foster fraternity. Courts can pass orders. But the remedy lies in political parties and democratic institutions living up to constitutional values and morality."" Justice Nagarathna added, ""The origin of speech is the thought process. Can by court order the thought process of a person be altered or restricted? What about free speech?""Justice Bagchi told Sibal, ""It is such a vague petition. Instead of it being a populist exercise, let it be a constructive constitutional exercise. Humdrum of politics should not dictate the filing of the PIL.""Sibal sought two weeks to amend the PIL.The two prayers of the petitioners read like fundamental duties of a citizen: a) declaration that public speeches of constitutional functionaries or holders of public office are subject to constitutional morality and should not violate fundamental rights of others; b) formulation of guidelines to govern public speech by constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats to ensure fidelity to constitutional morality, without imposing prior restraint or censorship.","12 'eminent' persons together filed a PIL ""targeting"" CMs of BJP-governed states for alleged hate speeches.

PATNA: The justice clock at Patna district courts ticked towards a rare moment on Monday when special judge Avinash Kumar of the CBI court delivered the verdict in a 15-year-old bank fraud case not inside a courtroom, but on the roadside.The extraordinary hearing took place outside the court premises as the accused, Jai Narayan Singh, a frail 95-year-old man, lay inside a vehicle, barely able to move his legs. At the fag end of his life, he admitted his guilt and pleaded for amnesty.The judge held Jai Narayan guilty, and disposed of the case after imposing a fine of Rs 2,000 on him. He was spared a prison sentence because of his advanced age and debilitating condition.The special court also took notice of the fact that Jai Narayan had already refunded to UCO Bank the entire loan amount - approximately Rs 4 lakh - which he had fraudulently obtained 15 years ago for the purchase of a tractor on the basis of forged documents.CBI had registered the case in 2011 against fake borrowers and other accused persons, including employees of UCO Bank, who allegedly swindled public money under the garb of agricultural loan schemes in Jamui district of Bihar.The judge heard the matter for nearly 35 minutes on the road leading to Patna civil courts.","Jai Narayan Singh, a frail 95-year-old man, lay inside a vehicle, barely able to move his legs.

SC: Compensation is not a substitute for punishment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-compensation-is-not-a-substitute-for-punishment/articleshow/128483599.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Sending a clear message to high courts and trial courts that a person convicted of a crime could not be let off with lenient punishment on agreeing to financially compensate the victim, Supreme Court on Tuesday said that such compensation could not be considered equivalent to or a substitute for punishment.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Vijay Bishnoi said that undue sympathy for the accused while imposing an inadequate sentence would do harm to society and erode public trust in the justice system. It expressed concern over the ""misplaced understanding"" of various high courts in treating compensation as a substitute for a sentence.""Compensation payable to the victim is only restitutory in nature, and it cannot be considered as equivalent to or a substitute for punishment. Punishment is punitive in nature, and its object is to create an adequate deterrence against the said crime and to send a social message to the miscreants that any violation of the moral norms of society would come with consequences, which cannot merely be purchased by money,"" Justice Bishnoi, who penned the judgment, said.The bench quashed a Madras high court order that had reduced a three-year jail term in an attempt to murder case to the sentence undergone by them (two months), after the two persons convicted agreed to pay Rs 50,000 each to the victim.It said the HC had acted in defiance of the law and made a travesty of established criminal jurisprudence in arriving at its conclusion.""The consideration to be kept in mind while awarding punishment is to ensure that the punishment should not be too harsh, but at the same time, it should also not be too lenient so as to undermine its deterrent effect... The objective of punishment is not to seek vengeance for the crime; rather, it is an attempt to reconstruct the damaged social fabric of society in order to pull back its wheel on the track,"" the bench said.SC said the provision of compensation had its roots in victimology, which acknowledged victims as the ""primary sufferers of the crime"" and advocated the idea of providing some relief from suffering.""The rationale behind victim compensation is to rehabilitate the victim for the loss and injury caused to them as a direct consequence of the crime or offence and not to exonerate the offender/accused from their culpability. The practice of enhancing the compensation payable to the victim and reducing the sentence, especially in cases of grave offence, is dangerous as it might send a wrong message to society that offenders/accused persons can absolve themselves from their liability by merely paying a monetary consideration,"" it said.""The misplaced understanding of various courts in treating compensation as a substitute for sentence is both a matter of concern and a practice which should be condemned,"" SC said, adding that it had observed a ""trend"" in HCs to reduce the sentences awarded by trial courts "" capriciously and mechanically, without any visible application of judicial mind"".",Supreme Court quashes a Madras high court order that had reduced a three-year jail term in an attempt to murder case to the sentence undergone by them (two months) Justices Rajesh Bindal and Vijay Bishnoi said that undue sympathy for the accused while imposing an inadequate sentence would do harm to society.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128483517,imgsize-54350,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-timings-chart.jpg"

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

AI-provided fake quotes have made our job tougher: CJI

NEW DELHI: As heads of govts and tech giants brainstorm how to reap benefits of the artificial intelligence revolution and dodge the risks that it poses, Supreme Court has expressed alarm over the growing practice of advocates using AI tools to draft petitions, and in the process, quoting from fictional judgments.CJI Surya Kant said, ""We are alarmed to learn that lawyers are using AI to draft petitions. It is very unfortunate that the petitions quote non-existent paragraphs from judgments,"" Justice B V Nagarathna said, ""A non-existent judgment Mercy vs Mankind was cited.""CJI Kant said there are several instances of such non-existent judgments having been cited in petitions, which were detected by Justice Dipankar Datta, echoing the concern in the US and other countries over the ""hallucination"" by large learning models.""There are instances where the petition quotes several paragraphs from a judgment of SC. But on scrutiny it was found that these paragraphs do not exist in the judgment,"" Justice Nagarathna said.CJI Kant said, ""It makes the judges' task more difficult. Now, they must not only go through the pleadings, but also scrutinise the authenticity of every paragraph quoted from cited judgments.""Recently, Bombay high court imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on Heart and Soul Entertainment Ltd for submitting AI-generated arguments citing a non-existent case.HC said, ""A strong pointer is seen from a reference made to one alleged caselaw 'Jyoti w/o Dinesh Tulsiani Vs. Elegant Associates'. Neither citation is given nor a copy of judgment is supplied by the Respondent. This court and its law clerks were at pains to find out this case law but could not find it. """"This has resulted in the waste of precious judicial time. If an AI tool is used in aid of research, it is welcome; however, there is great responsibility upon the party, even an advocate using such tools, to cross verify the references and make sure that the material generated by the machine/computer is relevant, genuine and in existence,"" HC said.Last Sept, Delhi high court had found a petitioner indulging in ""AI hallucination"" as it relied on paragraphs from two judgements, one which does not exist and in another the quoted paragraphs did not exist.Last month, Andhra Pradesh HC had refused to quash an order of a trial court judge who had passed an order relying on AI-prompted non-existent ruling. HC said though the citation was wrong, the legal principles applied by the trial judge were correct and in consonance with settled law.In March last year, Karnataka HC had taken adverse note of a city civil judge relying on non-existent SC judgments to pass an order and had said that this would require further inquiry.The bench of CJI Kant and Justices Nagarathna and Joymalya BagchiTuesday also recalled how crisp petitions used to be drafted by senior advocate and former law minister A K Sen.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""We are alarmed to learn that lawyers are using AI to draft petitions"" CJI Kant said there are several instances of such non-existent judgments having been cited in petitions.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that development isn't an absolute goal and that the right to a clean environment, which is part of the right to life, cannot be traded off with economic benefits.Declining permission for change of land for a cement factory to come up at Sangrur, Punjab, close to farms and a school, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta also quashed Central Pollution Control Board's revised industrial sector categorisation issued in Jan 2025, in which a ""stand-alone grinding unit without captive power plant"" was put in 'orange' category from 'red', allowing these near inhabited areas.Writing the judgment, Justice Nath said, ""Economic development and industrial growth are legitimate and important objectives... However, in a constitutional framework founded on rule of law, development isn't an abstract or absolute goal. It's conditioned by the non-derogable obligation to protect life, health and environmental integrity.""""Development that undermines these foundational values ceases to be constitutionally permissible development.When developmental activity poses a credible risk to human health or environmental safety, regulatory frameworks must err on the side of protection,"" he said.The Supreme Court said the Constitution does not permit a trade-off where civilian life and health are exposed to foreseeable harm on the assumption that economic benefit or industrial facilitation justifies such exposure.""Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India do not tolerate a regulatory calculus that treats environmental safety as negotiable,"" it said.Faulting the reclassification of industries and the dilution of the restrictions on locations without considering their proximity to habitation and ill-effect on environment, Justices Nath and Mehra said, ""Sector-level reclassification, divorced from exposure realities and local sensitivities, would become a ready instrument to justify siting of polluting activities near habitations, schools, and other sensitive receptors. """"Such an approach would not remain confined to the present case. It would operate as a precedent, enabling progressive erosion of preventive safeguards across regions, with cumulative and irreversible consequences. The law does not permit environmental protection to be weakened incrementally until harm becomes inevitable,"" the bench said.It said environmental degradation is mostly irreversible. ""A regulatory framework that allows risk to materialise first and seeks to address consequences later is fundamentally incompatible with constitutional environmental jurisprudence,"" it said. It said courts are slow to interfere with the developmental and economic activities of the state.","The Supreme Court has ruled that development isn't an absolute goal. The right to a clean environment, which is part of the right to life, cannot be traded off with economic benefits.

JAMMU: Amid outrage over the monkey menace destroying crops, Jammu and Kashmir govt on Tuesday informed the assembly it is not planning to launch a sterilisation drive to curb the simian population, even as it conceded that the threat remains a major headache across Jammu region.The govt, however, said a range of steps are being rolled out to tackle the problem, from pushing farmers towards monkey-resistant crops such as turmeric, ginger, and lemongrass to promoting boundary plantation of ladyfinger. Farmers are also being encouraged to install solar fencing, use monkey-deterrent devices and stop feeding the animals, the govt said.BJP’s Nagrota MLA Devyani Rana raised the issue in the assembly, stating that monkeys are ravaging crops in her constituency and posing a growing threat to public safety. She pressed for sterilisation, relocation, compensation and serious preventive interventions.Rana said that crop diversification may be a sound agricultural strategy, but farmers cannot be expected to absorb transition costs without institutional backing.“International and domestic experiences suggest that sterilisation must be large-scale, continuous and professionally monitored to produce a measurable demographic impact.Sporadic interventions yield negligible results,” she added.Official figures show that around 2,200 hectares of agricultural land in Nagrota alone have been affected by monkey-related crop damage, including fruit orchards.BJP MLA from Udhampur West, Pawan Gupta, warned that failure to launch a monkey sterilisation programme would lead to a serious situation in Jammu. “Thousands of kanals of land in my constituency are lying vacant because farmers are afraid to grow crops due to monkeys. Even at my own house in Udhampur, 40 to 50 monkeys gather every evening,” Gupta said.“It is said animals sleep in the evening, but these monkeys don’t. They should be moved back towards forest areas,” he said, adding that govt inaction would force many more farmers to abandon agriculture.","Jammu and Kashmir govt says it is not planning to launch a sterilisation drive to curb the simian population.

NEW DELHI: Days after its announcement in the Budget, the agriculture ministry on Tuesday launched AI-enabled ‘Bharat-VISTAAR’ (Virtually Integrated System to Access Agricultural Resources) that will help farmers in farm-level decision-making by receiving date-driven customised digital advisory.Launched at a time when India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, Bharat-VISTAAR is a multilingual AI tool that will integrate the AgriStack portals and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) package on farm practices with AI systems.Its use is expected to enhance farm productivity, enable better decisions for farmers and reduce risk by providing customised advisory support related to weather, market prices, pests and diseases, soil health, crop management, and information on major central govt schemes.Calling Bharat-VISTAAR a platform of “ask and get direct answers”, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said farmers will neither have to make rounds of offices nor struggle with digital applications.“They will now just have to dial 155261 by picking up a mobile phone and ask any farm-related question. They will get immediate answer in one’s local language about which medicine (pesticide/insecticide) to apply, when to sow and what rates (of selling price of crops) are available in the markets of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Delhi or Mumbai,” Chouhan said while launching the first phase of Bharat-VISTAAR.The scheme, which is devised as an “AI-based digital security shield”, has initially been started in Hindi and English languages. Farmers will eventually be able to interact in 11 languages under the system in future.Chouhan said a farmer identity card was also being created under the system that would contain all information about the farmer. “Preparations are underway to connect the entire agricultural system with the Bharat VISTAAR scheme,” he added.Currently, a couple of central schemes such as ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ and ‘Soil Health Card’ have been included in this scheme. Information about all major central schemes for farmers will be available through it in due course.The minister on the occasion also unveiled AI Hackathon focused on farmers and ‘Agri Kosh AI Strategy Roadmap’, emphasising innovative solutions for agricultural challenges.","Bharat-VISTAAR is a multilingual AI tool that will integrate the AgriStack portals and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) package on farm practices with AI systems.

Father, son and the 'Holy ghost'

NEW DELHI: Veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Tuesday fired a fresh salvo at Congress leadership with party's history to warn that the party has always thrived on internal dissent and suffered whenever it tried to suppress it.In a video released on his Youtube channel titled 'No space for dissent in today's Congress?' the leader said traced ideological conflicts, leadership rivalries and rebellions stretching back to the party's founding in 1885 to make the case that disagreement, not conformity, has been Congress's defining strength.""There was just one time when a complete ban was placed on any kind of dissidents.That was during Indira Gandhi 's Emergency,"" Aiyar said.According to him, the consequences of silencing dissent during that period were catastrophic. ""The Congress not only lost,"" he said, ""Indira Gandhi lost her Rae Bareli seat and Sanjay Gandhi lost his Amethi seat. That is what happens if you crush dissidents in the Congress party .""Aiyar argued that internal disagreement has existed within Congress almost from its inception and was never treated as an aberration. He cited the selection of Badruddin Tyabji as Congress president in 1888 and the backlash he faced from sections of the Muslim elite, describing it as one of the earliest recorded episodes of dissent within the party.He went on to recount ideological clashes between moderates and extremists in the early 20th century, particularly the split between Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal on one side and leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale and M.G. Ranade on the other, culminating in the Surat split of 1907.""The real strength of the Congress has been in the variety of opinion which the Congress has always accommodated,"" Aiyar said.He noted that despite sharp disagreements, figures like Tilak eventually became Congress president, while Mahatma Gandhi openly acknowledged Gokhale as his political guru, underlining the party's ability to absorb contradictions rather than eliminate them.Drawing pointed historical from 1929 when Subhas Chandra Bose sarcastically remarked that the Congress was being run by ""the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost"", Aiyar said: ""Nobody expelled Subhas Chandra Bose for what he had said.""He described how Bose later walked out of the Congress after fundamental disagreements with Mahatma Gandhi over non-violence, forming the Forward Bloc, but was never expelled. ""He walked out of the Congress. He was not expelled,"" Aiyar emphasised.Aiyar also recalled intense disagreements between Jawaharlal Nehru and his father Motilal Nehru, noting that ""it became impossible to have dinner in Anand Bhavan because the father and son were quarrelling so much among each other"".""That is how you deal with dissidents in the Congress party,"" Aiyar said.Aiyar argued that Indira Gandhi marked a decisive break from this tradition. While disagreements with the Congress ""Syndicate"" were initially accommodated, he said, her decision to split the party and later impose the Emergency represented a fatal intolerance of dissent.""She broke the party only because there were dissidents,"" Aiyar said, adding that the Emergency was ""the only way in which she could remain prime minister"".The verdict, he argued, came swiftly. ""The Congress not only lost,"" he repeated, ""Indira Gandhi lost her Raebareli seat and Sanjay Gandhi lost his Amethi seat.""He quoted two sentences Rajiv Gandhi uttered in the Lok Sabha on May 5, 1989:""Only a secular Bharat can survive,"" Rajiv Gandhi had said. ""And if India is not secular, then perhaps it does not deserve to survive.""Turning those words into a challenge, Aiyar said, ""I say to the Congress Party high command who have kept me out of the Working Committee, which now has 60 members, do you have the courage to repeat the words in the mouth of the son of Rajiv Gandhi?""Warning the current leadership, Aiyar said, ""If, therefore, the current establishment cannot stand a dissident, then I'm afraid it is the doom of the Congress.""""The Congress lives because of dissidents. The Congress grows because there are many opinions,"" he added.His final message was blunt: ""If we do not have the courage to answer the dissident in polite but firm language, then we do not deserve to rule.""The video comes amid row over his recent remarks on party leadership and praise for Kerala CM. The Congress has officially distaned itself from Aiyar saying he has no connection with the party.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar ""has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.""","Veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar says Congress has always thrived on internal dissent. He traced ideological conflicts, leadership rivalries and rebellions stretching back to the party's founding in 1885 to make the case that disagreement, not conformity, has been Congress's defining strength. The video comes amid a row over his recent remarks on the Congress leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128470054,imgsize-1429769,width-400,resizemode-4/mani-shankar-aiyar-file-photo.jpg"

Sanjay Raut Raises Doubts Over Ajit Pawar Plane Crash, Seeks Thorough Probe

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who died in a plane crash in Baramati last month.A delegation of senior party leaders, including his wife Sunetra Pawar, NCP National Working President and MP Praful Patel, State President and MP Sunil Tatkare, Maharashtra medical education minister Hasan Mushrif and youth leader Parth Pawar, submitted a memorandum to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking a CBI-led investigation.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed while attempting to land at the Baramati airport in Pune district. The incident has since triggered political controversy, with the NCP (SP), along with Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Indian National Congress, raising questions and alleging possible “foul play”.Earlier in the day, NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule said that there was growing unease over the circumstances surrounding Pawar’s death and that the civil aviation ministry should clarify the facts.“Ajit Pawar was Rohit Pawar’s uncle. Rohit Pawar, along with several others, has concerns and uneasiness regarding this matter.Amol Mitkari has also raised questions. Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Congress have fully supported us. They have said that this issue should be discussed in Parliament and even met the Speaker in this regard. There are many questions in the minds of the people, and they deserve answers,” Sule said.NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar criticised the pace of the investigation, alleging that nearly 20 days after the crash, there had been little visible progress.“20 days have passed since the unfortunate accident, yet the investigation hasn't gained any momentum. Is the delay solely to allow the VSR company to destroy evidence or does the company have someone's protection? This question has arisen in the minds of common citizens. The information emerging today about the black box being damaged makes it seem like the possibility I predicted five days ago is turning out to be true. Be that as it may, we will not rest until we get answers whether it was an accident or a murder in the case of Dada!” he said.","Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed while attempting to land at the Baramati airport in Pune district.

"Sabarimala row: With Kerala polls around, Left takes vague stand on women’s entry after backing reform",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sabarimala-row-with-kerala-polls-around-left-takes-vague-stand-on-womens-entry-after-backing-reform/articleshow/128464142.cms,"PM Modi Signals Political Shift In Kerala, Assures Sabarimala Probe, Attacks LDF-UDF In Big Rally

NEW DELHI: With Kerala heading towards Assembly elections, the ruling Left government on Tuesday refrained from spelling out its stand on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala Temple , saying it would decide after consultations and when the Supreme Court seeks its response.Facing sustained pressure from the opposition, states law minister P Rajeev and Devaswom minister V N Vasavan said the apex court had only constituted a larger bench to examine review pleas and had not yet asked the state government to clarify its position.“We have always been with the devotees. There is no doubt about it. We will never stand against devotees,” Vasavan told reporters, but avoided directly answering whether the government would support or oppose women’s entry, reported PTI.He said arguments in the matter would begin in April and that the government would inform the court of its stand after necessary consultations.Rajeev echoed the position, noting that the court would first examine whether it had the authority to intervene in traditional ritualistic practices at places of worship. “So, it is illogical to ask the government to announce its stand at this juncture,” he said, according to PTI.The minister added that the SC had indicated it would consider review pleas only after addressing seven fundamental questions, giving the government time to consult constitutional experts and scholars before taking a decision.The issue has resurfaced as a political flashpoint in poll-bound Kerala, with the Congress and BJP demanding clarity from the CPI(M)-led government, which had earlier backed the implementation of the 2018 verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine – a move that had sparked widespread protests across the state.CPI(M) general secretary M A Baby also avoided a categorical reply. He said that if the government wished to clarify its stand, it would hold discussions and take an appropriate decision. Referring to the earlier unrest, he said any decision must be taken after due deliberations and that no steps should lead to avoidable social tensions.The controversy regained momentum after the Supreme Court on Monday reopened the matter, announcing that a nine-judge bench would begin final hearings on petitions relating to discrimination against women in religions and places of worship, including Sabarimala.Under pressure from Hindu caste organisations and opposition parties, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government has maintained that the issue involves constitutional complexities and that it would adopt an appropriate stand after discussions. The opposition has urged the government to file a revised affidavit in the apex court clarifying its position.",Kerala's ruling Left government refrained from spelling out its stand on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala Temple.

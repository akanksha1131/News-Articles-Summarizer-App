Who was Saquib Nanchan?



NEW DELHI: Saquib Nachan, an ISIS-linked convicted terrorist, died at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday while receiving medical treatment, as confirmed by Tihar Jail authorities.Nachan was incarcerated in Tihar Jail Number 1 from December 27, 2023, before being transferred to a hospital due to his declining health condition.His medical journey involved an initial referral to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Hospital on June 22, followed by a transfer to Safdarjung Hospital on June 25. The Tihar administration received notification at 4 pm that Nachan had expired at 11.30 am on Saturday, according to ANI.His remains will be released to his family following post-mortem examination, with the final rites scheduled for Sunday at Borivali village near Padgha.Saquib faced conviction for his role in the Mumbai bomb blasts of 2002 and 2003, and held the position of self-proclaimed Amir-e-Hind for ISIS in India.The NIA's 2023 arrest of Nachan was based on allegations of his active involvement in promoting ISIS terrorist activities, the designated foreign terrorist organisation.The agency alleged his participation in the creation, instruction and assessment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) intended for terrorist operations.According to the federal agency, Nachan collaborated with other accused individuals in what became known as the Pune ISIS module case.Sources indicate that his son and legal representative visited him in hospital earlier this week.Following his conviction in 2016 for the 2002-03 Mumbai bomb blasts, Nachan completed a 10-year sentence before release, according to the official.In 2023, the National Investigation Agency apprehended Nachan and others for alleged terrorist activities, including IED production to advance the agenda of the banned ISIS organisation.NIA reports identified Nachan as the primary accused and self-proclaimed leader who administered the 'Bayath' oath of allegiance to the self-styled 'Khalifa' of ISIS for new members.Investigation agencies reported that the accused had declared the village an independent zone and centre for their alleged anti-national operations.In June 2024, the NIA filed charges against him and 16 other ISIS operatives. The charges pertained to their alleged conspiracy to recruit youth, produce explosives, propagate ISIS ideology in India, and manufacture improvised explosive devices in connection with the Delhi-Padgha ISIS terror module case.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) conducted extensive searches at 22 locations in Borivali and Padgha in early June, briefly detaining several suspects, including Nachan's relatives, who were released after questioning.""Two separate cases were registered in connection with these searches, which were based on specific inputs that Nachan and his associates had brainwashed and instigated people from the village to participate in anti-national activities,"" the official said.The ATS statement indicated the searches were part of measures following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, aimed at identifying anti-national elements providing logistical support for terrorist activities.Police have increased security presence in Padgha and neighbouring Bhiwandi in preparation for Nachan's final rites.""We are keeping a tab on the situation,"" said a police official.","Saquib Nachan, an ISIS-linked convicted terrorist, died at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday.

Maharashtra language row: Deputy CM Eknath Shinde hits back at Shiv Sena (UBT); calls opposition ‘double-faced’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-language-row-deputy-cm-eknath-shinde-hits-back-at-shiv-sena-ubt-calls-opposition-double-faced/articleshow/122138171.cms,"File photo: Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Amid a growing political uproar over the Maharashtra government’s move to introduce Hindi in schools, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday lashed out at the Shiv Sena (UBT), accusing it of playing “double-faced” politics and misrepresenting facts around the three-language formula.Responding to Uddhav Thackeray ’s faction’s demand for the resignation of school education minister Dada Bhuse, Shinde was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, “The then chief minister of Maharashtra had made mandatory the teaching of three languages – Marathi, English, and Hindi – based on the recommendations of the Raghunath Mashelkar Committee. When they were in power, they had a different opinion. Now that they are not, their stand has completely changed. The people who practise double-faced politics have no right to demand Dada Bhuse’s resignation.”This comes after Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray accused the BJP-led state government of forcing Hindi upon students and demanded that no language should be imposed. “Focus on what children are already studying. Restructure it and make it better. But don’t burden students further,” he said.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar also opposed the move, stating that while Hindi is widely spoken, it should not be forced at the primary level.“Let them learn Hindi after Class 5. But imposing it too early burdens children and sidelines their mother tongue,” he told reporters, urging the state to withdraw its insistence.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut blamed the central government, claiming that the decision was part of the new education policy promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. “This wasn’t the Maharashtra government’s decision. It was imposed by the Centre. The new education policy has been opposed by many states,” Raut alleged, as quoted by ANI.Meanwhile, deputy CM Ajit Pawar clarified that the cabinet would soon discuss the matter. “We’ve never supported forcing Hindi from the beginning. Let it be taught from Class 5, not earlier,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The controversy was triggered after an April 16 government resolution made Hindi mandatory as a third language in Marathi- and English-medium schools. Following backlash, the rule was amended to say Hindi would be the third language “in general,” with students allowed to opt for alternatives if at least 20 of them chose so.CM Devendra Fadnavis has also defended the policy, asserting that Marathi remains compulsory, while Hindi and English follow the Mashelkar committee recommendations accepted by the previous Uddhav Thackeray government. He said, “Marathi is compulsory. Hindi is optional. Students can choose any Indian language.”The issue is likely to be discussed during the upcoming monsoon session of the state legislature, with opposition parties planning joint protests against what they call the “imposition” of Hindi.",Eknath Shinde accuses Shiv Sena (UBT) of playing 'double-faced' politics.

NEW DELHI: Amidst the growing rift with the Congress Party, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday appears to have sided with the RSS-BJP over the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the RSS wanted 'Manusmriti', not the Constitution.While answering to a question over Rahul Gandhi's tweet that the RSS-BJP want Manusmriti instead of the Constitution, Congress MP said that historically the Raebareli MP is right as then RSS chief MS Golwalkar had said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it. ""But I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days,"" Tharoor said.""Historically, he's (Rahul Gandhi) referring to the fact that that was a criticism expressed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Mr Golwalkar, amongst others, said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it, but I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days. So, as a historical statement, it's accurate, whether it's a reflection of how they feel today. The RSS should be in the best position to answer that..."" Tharoor said while talking to reporters.Shashi Tharoor’s widening rift with the Congress Party has come under renewed spotlight after a string of pointed remarks and cryptic social media posts seemingly challenging the party's leadership.One such post read, “Don’t ask permission to fly. The wings are yours. And the sky belongs to no one.” This, followed by a series of similar messages, signaled growing tensions between Tharoor and the party.The tensions between Tharoor and Congress leadership rose after he praised PM Modi’s diplomacy during Operation Sindoor in a Hindu article, describing his “energy” and “dynamism” as assets for India’s global standing. The PMO shared the piece, fuelling speculation about Tharoor’s loyalty.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge indirectly rebuked him, suggesting his praise for PM Modi was inappropriate. ""We say nation first, but some consider Modi first, country later. What can we do about that?"" he asked.Tharoor, however, clarified that his remarks reflected national interest, not support for the BJP.","Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor appears to have sided with the RSS-BJP over Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the RSS wanted 'Manusmriti', not the Constitution.

What should students take away from these rankings?

The question matters now more than ever, as students across the globe weigh their future amid rising tuition fees, stricter immigration policies, and an increasingly competitive job market.Not everyone is lucky enough to be born in a country with a world-class education system and for millions of students, especially in developing nations, studying abroad is more than a dream; it’s a lifeline to opportunity, independence, and personal growth.According to the latest 2024 CEOWorld global education rankings, here are the top 10 countries that are acing the education game, based on two key indices: Quality and Opportunity.Home to Oxford, Cambridge, and a long tradition of academic excellence, the UK tops the 2024 rankings. With a robust public education system, global research powerhouses, and generous scholarship opportunities, it’s no surprise the UK continues to attract students from over 200 countries.According to the UK's Department for Education, the country ranks second globally in academic citations. Faculty credentials across Russell Group universities are among the highest in Europe and QS consistently ranks multiple UK institutions in the top 10 worldwide.The UK Parliament’s education review confirms that over 5% of GDP is allocated to education. With a 99% literacy rate and inclusive higher education access, the UK continues to offer opportunities for both domestic and international learners.The US holds its ground at #2, thanks to its unrivaled higher education ecosystem, which includes Ivy League institutions, STEM innovation, and expansive endowments. Despite its high cost, the US remains a top choice due to its research output and career-building opportunities post-graduation.According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the US leads the world in Nobel laureates, academic research funding, and publications. Seven of the world’s top 10 universities are located here.The Council for Higher Education Accreditation notes the US has over 4,000 accredited colleges. A 99% youth literacy rate, coupled with strong federal aid programs, ensures higher education access despite rising costs.Australia punches above its weight with eight universities in the global top 100. Its vibrant international student culture, generous post-study work rights, and strong linkages to industry make it a preferred destination in the Asia-Pacific region.According to the Australian Department of Education, universities here are heavily research-oriented and backed by industry partnerships, especially in climate science, medicine, and tech.The department also reports that nearly 6% of GDP is dedicated to education. With a literacy rate of 96%, the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system also provides vocational routes to higher education, expanding access across socioeconomic lines.With a wide range of English-taught programs and a progressive education model, the Netherlands has emerged as a European education hub.

Denmark spends around 6.3% of GDP on education.Known for safety, inclusivity, and multicultural campuses, Canada continues to be a top destination for Indian and Asian students. Strong university-industry linkages and favourable immigration pathways make it a pragmatic choice for long-term settlement.Universities Canada and QS report that Canadian institutions rank consistently in the global top 150 and offer applied programs in AI, healthcare, and sustainability.According to Statistics Canada, with a 99% literacy rate and 5.9% of GDP dedicated to education, Canada provides a strong support system and career prospects for international students.Zero or low tuition in public universities, a strong emphasis on engineering and applied sciences, and robust technical education pathways help Germany stand out in the global education landscape.According to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, institutions like those in the TU9 alliance are global leaders in engineering and applied sciences.Germany maintains a 99% literacy rate and robust dual education models, merging classroom and workplace learning.

Switzerland has among the highest R&D spends per capita in the world.With a 99% literacy rate and around 5.2% of GDP allocated to education, Switzerland’s multilingual and vocational education systems offer flexibility and high employability.The CEOWorld 2024 rankings, based on feedback from over 196,000 respondents across academia, business, and policymaking, reflect both perception and performance. While rankings alone shouldn’t determine where to study, they do provide an important starting point for evaluating return on investment, academic quality, and career prospects.While countries like the UK, US, and Australia remain dominant due to their reputation and infrastructure, emerging destinations such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden offer an excellent balance of affordability, innovation, and inclusivity.Ultimately, the best education system is one that aligns with your goals, supports your career aspirations, and offers an environment where you can thrive academically and personally.Choose wisely, not just where education is best rated but where it best fits you.","The CEOWorld rankings reveal the top 10 countries with the best education systems, based on quality and opportunity.

India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-time-in-space-axiom-4-finally-takes-off-shubhanshu-shukla-becomes-first-indian-to-cross-karman-line/articleshow/122078919.cms,"Poll What do you think is the most exciting aspect of Shubhanshu Shukla's mission? First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31 am ET (12.01n pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space, ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme,"" reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six year old son, Kiash, fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu. ""We have one kid with the crew, Shux's kid Sid, who basically just loves animals. We wanted dinosaurs and lions, but we couldn't find the right one. We were extremely happy when we found Joy.""","Shubhanshu Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984.

In India, health insurance is generally often an afterthought, something you purchase for tax benefits, or workplace compliance. And many of us assume that having a policy means being protected. Sure, there’s protection, but is it enough?Imagine this scenario: a family member is hospitalised, and there’s a comforting thought:But as bills arrive, comfort gives way to confusion. There are deductions for choosing a certain room, charges for procedures that aren’t included, and diagnostic costs that must be paid out of pocket. Suddenly, what looked like full protection feels anything but that.This isn’t just one person’s story, it’s increasingly common. And it raises a critical question: is your health insurance truly designed for the way healthcare works today?Healthcare has evolved dramatically over the last decade. There are more treatment options, earlier interventions, and a broader focus on prevention and recovery. With that has come a rise in costs, even for everyday care.Yet not all insurance plans have kept pace. While many policies offer a dependable foundation, some still have limitations that can leave policyholders exposed.Let’s take a closer look at what this means in real life.Imagine your policy has a room rent cap of ₹4,000. You’re admitted to a hospital and opt for a private room that exceeds the cap by ₹1,000 a day. Because of this, your entire claim; doctor’s fees, medicines, procedures, and tests; is reimbursed at only 80-90% on the claim.That one small upgrade leads to proportionally lower payouts across your bill. Plus, non-medical items like admission kits and registration fees aren’t covered; leaving you to cover the gap out of your pocket.These are part of your everyday healthcare journey. Having a policy that covers it all is crucial.Out-of-pocket healthcare spending in India continues to be high. Even with insurance, individuals often bear a significant share of healthcare costs.As health needs become more complex, insurance cover should reflect that shift. A good comprehensive health plan is structured around how people actually seek and receive care across hospitals, clinics and homes.Take, for example, a couple planning a family. A comprehensive plan would ensure maternity benefits are accessible, newborn care is covered from day one, and even vaccinations are included in the first year.Similarly, someone undergoing surgery should have access to pre-operative diagnostics, a second opinion if needed, and rehabilitation support post-discharge.A coverage that supports the entire spectrum, from pre-hospitalisation to post-recovery, secures both health and finances. A thoughtfully designed health policy not only responds to illness but anticipates life’s medical milestones. These features are what define meaningful coverage:Covering medical expenses before admission and after discharge helps manage the full treatment arc.Especially valuable for critical illnesses, this provides clarity and confidence before proceeding further.If the full coverage amount is used, it’s automatically restored for future use in the same year.Often overlooked, certain policies offer support for acute dental or eye-related treatments.Good comprehensive plans cover both the recipient’s treatment and the donor’s hospitalisation, including complications.Some plans offer home care; useful for post-surgery recovery, chronic illnesses or conditions that require clinical supervision without hospitalisation.For couples facing fertility challenges, some plans offer financial support for assisted reproductive procedures, helping make parenthood more accessible.Covers delivery expenses (normal or caesarean), congenital conditions, and early vaccinations for your baby.If recommended for obesity-related health issues like diabetes or cardiac risks, this is included after a waiting period.Some health plans now reward healthy habits with wellness points that are redeemable for renewal discounts.Select plans also include free expert teleconsultations and AI-based face scan to track vitals making preventive care digital-first and accessible.Regular check-ups are often included as part of the cover, encouraging preventive care and early detection of potential health issues.If you’re unsure whether your plan is truly comprehensive, use this checklist.It’s easy to treat health insurance as a box to tick. But when life takes a turn what matters is whether your cover holds up. Taking the time to reassess your plan is not only prudent, but essential. The right cover is the one that stands by you through the full spectrum of health: hospital, home, recovery, and beyond.That’s why it helps to go with an insurer that has seen it all. With over 19 years of experience and 1 crore+ claims settled, STAR Health has shaped its policies around the realities people face every day.Because in healthcare, the true cost is not what you pay for a policy; It’s what you pay when your policy falls short.","Maternity care often comes with a long waiting period or may not be included at all. dental and ophthalmic treatments are typically excluded, even though they’re common medical needs.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu. In January 2011, he was handed a jail term of 32 years.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia was sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Disregarding opposition parties' protests against its move to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar - requiring submission of citizenship proof by electors enrolled after 2003 - Election Commission has started the exercise in the state's 243 constituencies, with 98,450 booth level officers set to conduct door-to-door verification over the next one month.EC will treat the state's 2003 electoral roll - which has listed 4.9 crore electors - as probative evidence of eligibility, including pres-umption of Indian citizenship unless it receives any input otherwise.Also read: Bihar drive: EC to refer illegals for action under Citizenship Act Any person whose name is not recorded in the 2003 roll will be required to submit from among a set of 11 eligible government documents to establish his/her eligibility as an elector.

The party unequivocally disassociates itself from their statements and strongly condemns the same.”Backing the party’s statement, TMC MP Mahua Moitra wrote on X: “Misogyny in India cuts across party lines. What differentiates @AITCofficial is that we condemn these disgusting comments no matter who makes them.”However, the party's censure prompted a sharp response from Kalyan Banerjee, who posted a strongly worded reply on X, questioning the party's moral clarity. “Completely disagree with the post made by @AITCofficial on X. Are they indirectly supporting the leaders who are shielding these criminals? Mere academic statements won't bring any real change unless immediate action is taken against those leaders directly responsible,” he wrote.Banerjee further said, “What's even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes. I also wish to clearly distance myself from those who are encouraging or protecting these criminals. To truly understand the intent behind my words and statements, a certain level of moral and intellectual alignment is required — which, unfortunately, seems to be missing. ”Meanwhile, Banerjee also took a veiled swipe at sections within his own party, alleging that some leaders who rose to prominence after 2011 were themselves facing serious allegations. “What’s even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes,” he said.The backlash followed remarks made by Banerjee on Friday when he said, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend? Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her?” While he maintained that the accused should be arrested, his comments were widely criticised for appearing to shift responsibility away from the perpetrators.Earlier in the day, TMC MLA Madan Mitra also sparked outrage for blaming the survivor. “If someone calls you when the college is closed, then don't go. If she had taken a friend or informed someone, this wouldn’t have happened,” he had said.The alleged gang-rape took place on June 25 at South Calcutta Law College. The 24-year-old complainant accused three men - Manojit Mishra, Pramit Mukherjee, and Zaib Ahmed - of taking her to a guard’s room, raping her, recording the assault, and threatening to leak the video. She said she was confined for over three hours and was hit with a hockey stick when she resisted.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer, was working at the college on a temporary staff contract and is a practising lawyer. The college’s security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, has also been arrested. The accused are in police custody until July 1, and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and demanded a time-bound probe. The BJP, meanwhile, has launched an attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, with senior leaders demanding her resignation and accusing the state government of failing to protect women.","The Trinamool Congress publicly distanced itself from party MP Kalyan Banerjee and MLA Madan Mitra over their controversial remarks on the Kolkata law college gang-rape case.

Spymaster behind Op Sindoor is RAW chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spymaster-behind-op-sindoor-is-raw-chief/articleshow/122135489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seasoned IPS officer Parag Jain, a specialist on Pakistan and China, was appointed to lead the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), on the back of his pivotal role in the collection of crucial intelligence which shaped the precise execution of Operation Sindoor The Centre issued an order Saturday in this regard after the Cabinet approved Jain’s appointment, ushering in a new tech-focused era for India’s external intelligence agency. He will have a two-year tenure after taking over on July 1.

His key stints were in Nepal, Canada, where his team tracked Khalistani outfits and their members, and in Sri Lanka during its economic crisis.“In his new role, he will prioritise leveraging technology for advanced intelligence collection, monitoring diaspora communities, and developing strategies to counter hybrid warfare tactics, particularly in response to the escalating threats of disinformation warfare posed by China and Pakistan,” a govt officer said.With experience in leading the Pakistan and Canada desks, Jain has been an asset for the agency for the last 14 years, spearheading many technical-and-human-intelligence-based operations, sources said.As chief of ARC in the cabinet secretariat, Jain is credited with the introduction of new technology in unmanned surveillance using drones, besides aerial monitoring to support special operations.While Jain has his task cut out as the head of the agency, China and Pakistan post-Op Sindoor are being considered his key focus areas.

'India appears truly grand from space': Shubhanshu Shukla tells PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-appears-truly-grand-from-space-shubhanshu-shukla-tells-pm-modi/articleshow/122133500.cms,"LIVE: Shubhanshu Shukla speaks with PM Modi from the International Space Station

“From space, one cannot see borders—there are no visible boundaries between nations. What stood out most was the sheer unity of the planet,” Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video interaction from the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday.“When we look at maps, we compare the sizes of countries, including India, and often see a distorted picture because we’re flattening a three-dimensional world onto paper,” he said. “But from space, India appears truly grand—majestic in scale and spirit.”Shukla, the first Indian to reach the ISS, said this overwhelming sense of oneness aligns perfectly with India’s civilisational motto of unity in diversity.“From above, Earth looks like a single home shared by all, reminding humanity of the harmony and connection we inherently share.” PM Modi congratulated him for “hoisting the flag of India in space” and said: “Although you are the farthest from the Indian motherland, you are the closest to the hearts of all Indians.”He added, “Today I can say with confidence that this is the first chapter of success of India’s Gaganyaan mission . Your historic journey is not just limited to space—it will give speed and new vigour to our journey of Viksit Bharat.”Calling science and spirituality the twin strengths of India, the PM said, “With the success of the Chandrayaan mission, there is renewed interest in science among children and youth.Now your historic journey is giving more power to this resolve.”In response, Shukla said, “This is not just my personal journey—it reflects the direction in which India is advancing. Under your leadership, today’s India enables the realisation of dreams that once seemed impossible.”He spoke of the challenges in adapting to microgravity. “Even the smallest tasks are complex. I’ve strapped my feet down just to stay in place during this conversation!” he said, adding that one could sleep on the wall, ceiling or “even on the forehead” since orientation is fluid in orbit.When asked whether meditation and mindfulness had helped, Shukla agreed: “As you rightly said, science and spirituality are both our nation’s strength. The calmer you are, the better your decisions. One cannot eat while running. In space, inner calm is crucial.”The astronaut also shared details of the scientific experiments he’s carrying out. “For the first time, Indian scientists have designed seven unique experiments for the space station,” he said. One experiment uses stem cells to study muscle loss in microgravity and could help the elderly on Earth. Another focuses on cultivating highly nutritious microalgae to support food security. “Processes occur faster in space, which accelerates research,” Shukla said.PM Modi praised these efforts and said Shukla’s journey would inspire young Indians. “Today’s children don’t just look at the sky—they believe they can reach it. This mindset is the foundation of India’s future missions.”The Prime Minister added that “India must move forward with Mission Gaganyaan, build its own space station, and achieve the landing of an Indian astronaut on the Moon.” He also expressed confidence that Shukla was “diligently recording his observations and learnings”.Shukla confirmed that he had been absorbing every detail “like a sponge” and said his international colleagues had expressed interest in being part of Gaganyaan. “I told them, ‘Very soon,’” he said, promising to apply his learnings fully to accelerate India’s upcoming missions.He closed by addressing India’s youth: “There’s no one path to success, but if you never stop trying, it will come—sooner or later.”PM Modi concluded: “India is opening new frontiers in space for the world… The sky is no longer the limit.”","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is the first Indian to reach the ISS.

NEW DELHI: TMC leader Madan Mitra on Saturday, while defending his party, appeared to blame the victim in the Kolkata law college gang-rape case, saying, ""If someone calls you when the college is closed, then don't go. ""Addressing reporters in North 24 Parganas, the former West Bengal minister said the incident sent a message to girls about caution.“If that girl had not gone there, this wouldn't have happened. If she had informed someone before going or had taken a couple of friends with her, then this wouldn't have happened,” he said.He further added, “The one who committed this dirty deed took advantage of the situation.”Mitra also attempted to distance the party from the accused, saying, “TMC is a big party. Someone or the other is associated with Trinamool everywhere... We get our photos taken with everyone, but what's inside a person, only a psychologist can tell.”MP Kalyan Banerjee on Friday also triggered a controversy by saying, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend?”Banerjee questioned the role of police in such incidents and added, “Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student.Who will protect her?” He insisted that the accused should be arrested but distanced himself from the incident, stating, “I am not an advocate into the incident that occurred at the Law College but the accused should be arrested. A few men commit this type of crime.”His remarks came even as the alleged gang-rape of the 24-year-old law student continues to trigger public outrage and political backlash in West Bengal. The incident, which took place inside the premises of South Calcutta Law College, has drawn comparisons to the earlier RG Kar case, reviving grim memories of systemic lapses.According to the student’s police complaint, she was raped by three men — Manojit Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer now working on an ad hoc teaching assignment, and two junior students, Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed. She alleged that the trio forced her into the college guard room, undressed and gang-raped her, filmed the assault, and threatened to leak the footage if she approached police.“When I resisted, one of them hit me with a hockey stick,” she said. “I touched his feet, but he did not let me go.” She also reported that she was confined for over three hours and suffered a panic attack. The assailants only allowed her to use an inhaler, denying her further help.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Later, the college security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, was also held. A five-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed by Kolkata Police to probe the case. The accused have been remanded to police custody till July 1.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and has demanded a time-bound investigation under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. BJP national president JP Nadda has also constituted a four-member inquiry team comprising Satpal Singh, Meenakshi Lekhi, Biplab Deb and Manan Mishra to visit the college and submit a detailed report.Meanwhile, BJP leaders across Bengal have mounted pressure on chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “This incident reveals the character of TMC and their thoughts towards women. I demand Mamata Banerjee’s immediate resignation,” said BJP MLA Shankar Ghosh.Union minister and West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar was detained by police while protesting the incident. “This is the face of democracy in West Bengal... Mamata Banerjee has ruined it,” he said.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also hit out at the chief minister, saying, “There is an air of disbelief about where Bengal is heading. Where there is a female chief minister, there ought to be sensitivity towards women, so why is there such cruelty?”The centring of blame on the victim by a senior TMC leader has deepened political tensions and drawn strong condemnation from opposition parties and civil society groups, who have demanded accountability, justice for the survivor, and an end to institutional negligence.","TMC leader Madan Mitra appeared to blame the victim in the Kolkata law college gang-rape case.

IIT-Kanpur to conduct trials for artificial rain

Delhi govt is likely to conduct a cloud seeding pilot project between July 4 and 11, when weather is expected to be feasible for causing artificial rain, city environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said. He added that govt had received a report from IMD, which has been shared with DGCA along with a flight map for getting permission for the project.The govt has chalked out a tentative flight plan for the experiment, which includes Bawana, Rohini, Alipur, Kundli and Burari. The minister said IMD's reports and the flight map were approved in coordination with IIT Kanpur.The Delhi cabinet had on May 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials, with a project outlay of Rs 3.21 crore. The trials were to be carried out in May-end and early June in collaboration with IIT Kanpur.""The met department told us that till July 3 conditions are not feasible for cloud seeding; however, the July 4-11 window is favourable. DGCA has sought a backup time window in case cloud-seeding turns unfeasible during July 4-11 due to weather changes,"" Sirsa said.""We believe that by Monday we'll see progress in getting approvals from DGCA,"" the minister said.Cloud seeding is a weather-modification technique that introduces chemicals into the air to aggregate and condense moisture particles into rain. In this technique, compounds such as silver iodide (AgI) are released into the atmosphere to aid the formation of ice crystals that lead to rain.Soon after the formation of the BJP-led govt in Delhi, Sirsa announced that they would seek no-objection certificates from agencies concerned for conducting artificial rain in the winter season, when the capital records high pollution levels. Later, on June 18, the minister said govt had received all clearances barring that from the DGCA. For cloud seeding, clearances are needed from the Special Protection Group (SPG), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Union ministries of environment, defence and home, UP govt, IMD as well as DGCA, Airport Authority of India and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.Trials for artificial rain will be executed by IIT Kanpur, which had earlier conducted the experiment using its own modified aircraft equipped with a mist sprinkler aiming to cover a minimum of 100sq km per sortie. The minister had earlier said IIT Kanpur's aircraft has the necessary permit from DGCA and can remain in the air for around five hours. Scientists from IIT Kanpur expect the sortie to take at least one hour and 30 minutes. The minister had also stated that after the trial, water samples will be collected to conduct a study to ensure see if there are harmful chemicals in it.He added that as per global studies and an earlier trial run by IIT Kanpur, the success rate is around 60-70%. As per IIT Kanpur, nimbostratus clouds are the most suitable type for seeding experiments. These are usually at heights of 500-6,000 meters above ground level.The previous AAP govt had repeatedly proposed conducting artificial rain during winters but shelved it citing unfavourable meteorological conditions. During the winter of 2024, the AAP govt had floated the plan again but later alleged that it was not getting enough support or backing from the Centre.",The Delhi cabinet had on May 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials.

On the other hand, India aligns with the global pattern for men, with around 3% of working-age men (15–64 years) being entrepreneurs, which is in line with expectations given its income levels.The research draws upon data from the World Bank covering 186 countries in 2022 and points out that India is one of the most significant outliers in terms of low female entrepreneurship, given its stage of economic development.Using nationally representative data, the research paper, presented at NCAER's India Policy Forum on Friday, showed that female labour force participation explained much of the gender gap in self-employment, but not in entrepreneurship, where women remain under-represented. It found large, persistent barriers to firm growth for women, even in richer states—highlighting the need for multidimensional, state-specific policy solutions.Among various data sources, the authors, Gaurav Chiplunkar from University of Virginia and Pinelopi K. Goldberg from Yale University, drew upon data on working-age population -- (21-65 years) in the 2023 round of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). “Overall, 64% of individuals participate in labour but this masks differences across gender: 91% of men participate in labour as compared to only 39% of women, implying that for every 10 men there are only 4.2 women in the labour force,” the paper stated.Furthermore, 35% of men and 12% of women operate own-account enterprises, which makes them self-employed individuals without hired labour.","Less than 1% of Indian women are entrepreneurs, placing India far below the global trendline.

According to auction house AstaGuru's ""Collectors' Choice"", the sculpture is believed to have been dedicated to Kadambari Devi, wife of Tagore's brother Jyotirindranath.At the same auction, a set of 35 handwritten letters and 14 envelopes sent by Tagore to sociologist Dhurjati Prasad Mukerji between 1927 and 1936, fetched Rs 5.9 crore. The estimated bidding price of the set was between Rs 5 crore and Rs 7 crore.Tagore was only 22 when he sculpted 'The Heart' in 1883 during a contemplative retreat in the coastal town of Karwar in Karnataka in the company of his brother Satyendranath and sister-in-law Jnanadanandini Devi. On it, he engraved in Bengali - ""Having cut my heart of stone, I have engraved (the words) with my own hand. Will it be ever effaced by the flow of tears?""""Any piece by Tagore, be it a sculpture or a letter, is priceless. It does't surprise me that they fetched a high value. Though it is the prerogative of the owner to decide where they want to keep it, I would personally love to see them in museums. People should be able to read letters by Tagore or see a piece sculpted by him. Though I belong to the family, I believe Tagore belongs to humanity,"" said Sumanto Chattopadhyay, great-great-grandson of Satyendranath.","The sculpture is believed to have been dedicated to Kadambari Devi, wife of Tagore's brother Jyotirindranath.

"'You may be far, but hearts of 140cr Indians beat with you, it’s start of new era': PM Modi to Shukla on ISS",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-may-be-far-but-hearts-of-140cr-indians-beat-with-you-its-start-of-new-era-pm-modi-to-shukla-on-iss/articleshow/122136426.cms,"NEW DELHI: “Earth looks borderless and gives feeling of oneness, and Bharat looks big from space,” Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla told PM Narendra Modi on Saturday during his first interaction with the PM through a video link from the International Space Station while “orbiting Earth at an altitude of 400 km"". Cheering the astronaut, Modi told him that “you may be far from us but the hearts of 140 crore Indians beat with you”.“The first thing I saw was Earth — it looks perfectly unified. No borders are visible. India looks so large from here, far more prominent than on a map. From up here, there are no countries, no divisions — just one home. That is our ethos: unity in diversity. Just a while ago, when I saw from the window of ISS, I could see Hawaii,” Group Captain Shukla told the PM while informing him, “I have hoisted the tricolour on ISS. India has reached ISS. ”Also read: 'Furthest from motherland but closest to Indian hearts': PM Modi interacts with Shubhanshu Shukla in ISS - watch video Modi said Shukla’s name carries the word ‘shubh’ (meaning auspicious) and that his journey marked the auspicious “beginning of a new era”. The Indian astronaut told the PM that his space sojourn was “not my journey alone but also our country’s”.“We trained for a year and I learnt about different systems...but after coming here, everything changed...Here, even small things are different because there is no gravity in space...Sleepinghere is a big challenge...I can even sleep on the roof. It takes some time to get used to this environment,” Shukla told the PM, while adding, “Right now, we are travelling at a speed of 28,000 kmph and I am talking to you with my legs tied. ” “This speed reflects how fast our nation is progressing and now, we must go even beyond this,” he said.The astronaut said the space station orbits Earth 16 times a day and that he is privileged to witness 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day.Also read: Nostalgia hits hard: 41 years after Rakesh Sharma's 'saare jahan se acha', Shubhanshu Shukla calls India 'majestic' from space While referring the astronaut as “Shux”, PM gave him “homework”, telling him to learn as much as possible because the lessons learnt from this Axiom-4 mission “will have to be extensively used in the Gaganyaan mission , our own Bharatiya Antariksh Station and also for landing an Indian on the Moon.” Shukla told Modi that he is “absorbing experiences at ISS like a sponge”.When the PM asked about Indian delicacies he carried to space and whether he shared them with his space mates, Shukla said he is carrying “gajar ka halwa, moong dal halwa, and aamras into orbit”. “I wanted my fellow crew members from other countries to taste India’s heritage. We all sat together and enjoyed it. They loved it,” Shukla said.Shukla shared his reflections from space — on science, struggle, and the boundless dreams of a rising nation. The call was more than ceremonial. It was a glimpse into how India’s spacefaring ambitions have matured. Modi described Shukla’s journey not as a solitary voyage but as India’s own orbit of progress. “When I was a child, I never imagined I could become an astronaut. But today, modern India enables the realisation of such dreams,” Shukla said.Also read: India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS When asked by Modi about microgravity tests he will carry out on ISS, especially from the medicine and agriculture sectors, Shukla said, he “will do seven experiments”. “Today, I am going to do a test on stem cells. I am doing a test on supplements to see if such supplements can help prevent muscle loss. This will help people in old age who are losing muscle due to ageing,” he said. Another test explores the cultivation of nutrient-rich microalgae, which could boost food security back home. “The advantage of space,” he said, “is that processes happen quickly. That accelerates research and inspires children back home to say, ‘I can go there too’.”PM Modi asked what message he would send to India’s youth. Shukla responded with clarity and conviction: “Never stop trying. Whether today or tomorrow, success will come if you don’t give up. This is just the first chapter of India’s space story. We’ll build our own space station. We’ll land Indian astronauts on the Moon. And, I’m documenting everything—every lesson I learn will help others fly sooner.”His final words struck a chord destined to echo across classrooms, command centres and quiet corners of the country: “The sky is never the limit—not for me, not for you, and not for India.”‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ chant filled up the space station as the PM raised the slogan towards the end of the 18-minute conversation, which was reciprocated by Shukla.","Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla has his first interaction with the PM through a video link from the International Space Station. “The first thing I saw was Earth — it looks perfectly unified.

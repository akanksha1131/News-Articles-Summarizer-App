'Tamilians know what language they need': Kamal Haasan's warning amid language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamilians-know-what-language-they-need-kamal-haasans-warning-amid-language-row/articleshow/118468378.cms,"Kamal Haasan

NEW DELHI: Actor and politician Kamal Haasan on Friday emphasised the linguistic pride among Tamilians and warned those who might take language issues lightly.Amid the ongoing row between state government and Centre National Education Policy (NEP), Hassan referred to the state's historic struggle against the imposition of Hindi and said that people of Tamil Nadu have the knowledge to choose which language they need.""Tamilians have lost their lives for a language. Don't play with those things. Tamilians, even children, know what language they need. They have the knowledge to choose which language they need,"" Haasan said while addressing party cadres in Chennai on the 8th foundation day of his party, Makkal Needhi Maiyam (MNM).This comes after Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan responded to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalis's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, clarifying that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 does not mandate any language.He targeted the Tamil Nadu CM for interpreting NEP 2020 with a ""myopic vision"" and for portraying progressive educational reforms as political threats. Pradhan also stated that the chief minister's letter to PM contradicted the spirit of cooperative federalism.In his letter to the Prime Minister on Thursday, Stalin expressed concerns over Union education minister Pradhan's statement that Tamil Nadu's 'Samagra Shiksha' funds would not be released unless the state implements the 'three-language' policy outlined in NEP 2020.Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai supported the three-language policy, saying that learning a third language is beneficial for Tamil Nadu. He also accused the DMK and its allies of misleading the public by claiming that Hindi would be mandatory under the new education policy.Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin argued that “Hindi will destroy Tamil like it did many North Indian languages.”The INDIA bloc parties united to protest against the BJP-led central government, accusing it of encroaching on state rights, denying funds in the Union Budget, and withholding educational funds for Tamil Nadu.""Hindi destroyed the local languages of states in the north such as Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri, and other Bihari languages and has become the primary local language. The same will happen if Hindi is implemented in Tamil Nadu too. Almost 99% of Tamils who are now working abroad and in prestigious organisations such as Isro were from govt schools who did not study Hindi,"" Udhayanidhi said at the protest.","Hassan referred to the state's historic struggle against the imposition of Hindi.

She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves. ""We will know the details for sure, including the time of death, only after the autopsies,"" said assistant CP (Thrikkakara) P V Baby.Manish's colleagues were the first to find the bodies when they visited the house to check on him as he was supposed to resume work the previous day after a period of leave but was incommunicado.Police found a note in Manish' diary, dated Feb 15, with an instruction to hand over some documents to his younger sister, who is currently in Dubai. The note mentions her phone number. ""She will be arriving soon after the autopsies, which most likely will be done on Saturday,"" a police officer said.Shalini was the topper among 64 civil servants recruited through JPSC's first combined exam in 2003.Some candidates who didn't make the cut challenged the recruitment process soon after, pointing out that many of those who cleared the exam were linked to politicians or officials. As the state probe dragged on, Jharkhand HC had the case transferred to CBI in 2022.CBI filed charges against Shalini and the other recruits under sections 420 (cheating), 423 (fraudulent documentation) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, among other offences, along with 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The next hearing is scheduled for Feb 27.The Vijay family lived in a rented house in Ranchi until 2013.

""What were the govt and its agencies doing? Does not destabilisation in Bangladesh affect India? There was a time, like in 1971, when even the US would back down in front of the Indian govt.

PRAYAGRAJ: With the rush of devotees for Maha Kumbh leading to the 'unofficial' closure of the wholesale medicine market in Prayagraj, the city is facing a severe crisis of medicines, including essential and life-saving drugs. Despite repeated pleas from traders and pharmaceutical suppliers, the authorities have so far ignored the SOS messages, leading to growing concerns among residents and medical professionals, reports Kapil Dixit.Leader Road, which serves as the largest wholesale medicines hub in the city, is situated on the busiest path from Sangam towards the railway station. Due to this, the entry of trucks carrying medical supplies has been strictly prohibited. Since mid-January, the market has struggled to operate efficiently, primarily due to the uninterrupted flow of devotees in the area. As a direct consequence, medicine stocks, particularly for blood pressure, heart diseases, and diabetes, have nearly run out at both wholesale and retail levels, leaving patients and hospitals in distress.Anil Dubey, who heads the Allahabad Chemist and Druggist Association, told TOI, ""Since January 24, traders engaged in the wholesale drug business have not been able to function properly. This has created a massive gap between demand and supply, which is worsening every passing day.""Traders have repeatedly complained that the supply chain has been severely disrupted as trucks carrying medicines are not permitted to enter city limits. ""Association members have made several attempts to convey the severity of the drug shortage to the concerned district authorities, but their appeals have fallen on deaf ears,"" Dubey said. No transporter is willing to book medicine consignments to Leader Road due to the strict enforcement measures imposed by the police and district authorities.Government officials, however, have dismissed the concerns, stating that there has been no official order for the closure of the market.","Prayagraj's wholesale medicine market faces a shutdown amid the Maha Kumbh rush, causing a severe shortage of essential medications.

Dr Singh, part of the five-member board, had given a separate opinion.Writing the judgment, Justice Viswanathan said, ""The 'both hands intact' prescription has no sanctity in law as it does not admit of a functional assessment of the individual candidate, a matter which is so fundamental in protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.""

BSP's impact despite zero wins

The BSP dilemma: Ally or adversary?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited political debates by questioning Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief Mayawati 's current electoral approach. Addressing Dalit students in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi asked,Behenji aajkal chunaav theek se kyun nahi lad rahi (Why is Mayawati not fighting polls properly these days)?Reflecting on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi revealed that Congress had invited Mayawati to join the INDIA bloc alliance but she declined.If Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), and BSP had come together, BJP would have lost,"" he asserted.Mayawati responded swiftly, accusing Congress of harboring amalicious and casteist” attitude toward the BSP. She further criticised Congress’s strategy in Delhi, where the party contested alone against both BJP and INDIA bloc ally Aam Aadmi Party, leading to a significant BJP victory .In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh’s first Dalit chief minister, chose to stay neutral by neither joining INDIA bloc not NDA. While the SP-Congress alliance secured 43 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the INDIA bloc overall couldn’t unseat the NDA, paving the way for Narendra Modi’s historic third term as Prime Minister.Though BSP failed to win a single seat, its influence on poll outcome in Uttar Pradesh was undeniable. BSP candidates significantly affected INDIA bloc prospects in at least 16 constituencies, including Hardoi, Aligarh, Meerut, Unnao, and Mirzapur. This is on the assumption that all votes that Mayawati's party polled would have been transferred to its alliance partner. If Mayawati had joined hands with Rahul and Akhilesh and assuming her supporters would have backed the INDIA bloc, the opposition coalition could have clinched 59 seats in Uttar Pradesh, cutting the NDA’s tally to 20.On a national scale, this would have raised the INDIA bloc’s count to 250 seats against NDA’s 277 — still short of power but significantly closer.Interestingly, however, BSP’s presence as a neutral player prevented potential losses for the INDIA bloc. Of the 43 seats won by the Congress-SP alliance, there were 31 seats where Mayawati got considerable vote resulting in BJP's defeat. In seats like Azamgarh, Lalganj, Jaunpur, Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, and Saharanpur, INDIA bloc could beat BJP because Mayawati was neutral and polled significant votes. On these seats, if Mayawati was with INDIA bloc, its victory margin over the BJP would have increased.Now let's assume the opposite. If Mayawati had decided to join hands with the NDA, then it would have won all these 31 seats and decimated the INDIA bloc. So while Rahul Gandhi may have been partially correct in critisising Mayawati for not joining INDIA bloc, he should be thankful to the BSF chief for staying neutral and not joining the BJP-led NDA.The BSP secured 9.39 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s total vote share — just shy of Congress’s 9.46 per cent —yet remained third in nearly all 80 constituencies.This complex electoral math, which is obviously based on the assumption of a complete transfer of votes, highlights the importance of BSP in Uttar Pradesh politics despite its losing sheen over the years. The unpredictable leader that Mayawati is, both NDA and INDIA bloc would be closely watching her next steps.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited political debates by questioning Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief Mayawati's current electoral approach.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde has once again sent a strong message to his political opponents and allies alike, warning them not to underestimate him. Reflecting on his political journey and the 2022 rebellion that reshaped the state’s leadership, Shinde asserted that he is not just any party worker but a disciple of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray and his mentor Anand Dighe.""I have said this earlier too—those who took me lightly… I am a worker, but a worker of Balasaheb and Dighe Saheb, so everyone should treat me in that way,"" Shinde told reporters. ""When they took me lightly, I overturned the government in 2022 and brought the government of people's choice.""Shinde’s rebellion had led to a vertical split in the Shiv Sena, with a majority of MLAs siding with him, ultimately resulting in the collapse of Uddhav Thackeray’s government. His alliance with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis secured them a dominant position in the state, a feat he proudly referenced. ""Back then, I had said in my first speech in the Assembly that I and Devendra Fadnavis will win more than 200 seats, and we got 232 seats,"" he said. ""So, 'don't take me lightly'—those who need to understand this signal should understand it.""Meanwhile, at the press conference in Nagpur, Eknath Shinde strongly criticised the Shiv Sena-UBT saying that those leaders who have left Balasaheb Thackeray’s thoughts and those pushing good people out of the party were pushed back by the people in the Assembly elections and made to stay at home forever.""However, Shiv Sena is the one that carries forward the thoughts of Balasaheb Thackeray and Dharmaveer Anand Dighe. Therefore, leaders, office bearers and activists of different parties from across the state are joining Shiv Sena,” he added.On the email threat that he received, the Maharashtra Deputy CM said: ""I am a worker of Balasaheb Thackeray and Anand Dighe. Dance bars were closed when Anand Dighe was there. There were many threats at that time too. When I was the Guardian Minister of Gadchiroli, Maoists gave threats, but the Gadchiroli police did the job of curbing the LWE menace. I am not afraid of threats... I am a person who remains strong.”Meanwhile, Mumbai Police arrested two suspects—Mangesh Achyutrao Wayal (35) and Abhay Gajanan Shingane (22)—from Buldhana in connection with the threat email. Investigations are ongoing to determine the motive behind the threat.","Eknath Shinde says he is not just any party worker but a disciple of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray and his mentor Anand Dighe.

While some victims have been rescued, the embassy warns that the true scale of the scam is far larger, with many still unaware of the dangers they face.While consular officials are working to evacuate Indian citizens, the embassy has warned that those willingly participating in these scams are not victims but criminals. Indian authorities have urged job-seekers to verify employment offers in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand before travelling, as those involved in scams may face legal consequences.Myawaddy has become a notorious hub for cyber crime, where workers are coerced into participating in online fraud operations , often under duress. Many of the victims, who have fallen prey to false job promises, are trapped in scam centres with no means of escape, unless they pay large ransoms. With the region controlled by warlords and militia groups, efforts to intervene have been complicated, though Indian consular officials are working to evacuate those who have sought help.Thai authorities, responding to global pressure, have taken action by cutting electricity, internet, and fuel supplies to key areas in Myanmar where these operations are based. In addition, China has urged Thailand to clamp down on the cross-border power supply networks that support these cyber scam syndicates. Despite these measures, the situation remains dire, with many Indian nationals caught in a perilous trap.While at least 150 individuals have been identified as victims, officials suspect the actual number is much higher as many are reportedly working voluntarily without notifying Indian authorities. Sources in ministry of external affairs said efforts are underway to assist those who have sought help.On Feb 18, three Indians managed to escape from a scam centre in Myawaddy and were helped by the embassy to reach Yangon.

NASA’s New Update RevealsThe Truth About Asteroid 2024 YR4

An asteroid that is likely to hit Earth in the year 2032 has major Indian cities at risk according to the assessment by astronomers.Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032. Although much of the object’s estimated track passes over an empty ocean, it includes mega Indian cities Mumbai and Kolkata.Based on the trajectory, towns in the state of Maharashtra, Northern Telangana, Southern Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal are also at risk. The impact, however, depends on several factors like entry angle, speed, and atmospheric effects.Other probable impact locations in the world include Bogotá, Colombia; Lagos and Nigeria.Although the asteroid is not large, especially when compared to a much larger asteroid Apophis discovered in 2004, its potential impact is nevertheless capable of creating extensive destruction. Nasa , however, has lowered the probability of the asteroid striking the Earth to 1.5%.The speed of the asteroid will be approximately 40,000 miles per hour, which will generate an energy outflow 500 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, and the explosion could very well annihilate a whole city.The kinetic energy of an asteroid is a proxy for how destructive its impact would be. And as asteroids mostly move at the same speed — about 38,000 mph — the key variable is its mass. The composition is also important. 2024 YR4 is statistically likelier to be a stony asteroid, which is more prone to fragment into smaller pieces as it is heated during its atmospheric descent.While the thought of an asteroid hitting Earth is undoubtedly unsettling, the probability of 2024 YR4 making contact in 2032 is extremely low. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the asteroid’s path.The asteroid was initially discovered on December 27, 2023, by Chilean El Sauce Observatory, 2024 YR4.","Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032.

This brings the total number of judicial recusals in his cases to 13, which legal eagles say is a record of sorts.So far, two SC judges, two Uttarakhand HC judges, the CAT chairman, a Shimla trial court judge, and seven CAT judges from Delhi and Allahabad benches have refrained from adjudicating Chaturvedi's matters. In its latest order on Feb 19, CAT bench of Justices Oberoi and Anand directed the registry not to list his cases any further without providing specific reasoning. Chaturvedi's counsel, Sudershan Goel, said the case pertained to his appraisal report.In Feb 2024, an Uttarakhand HC judge had recused from hearing Chaturvedi's deputation case. According to his counsel, in 2018, the HC had directed the officer's service matters be heard exclusively at Nainital circuit bench. This decision was upheld by SC. ""In 2021, HC reiterated its stance, but Centre challenged it.

In Aug 2016, then-SC judge U U Lalit recused from the case.In 2007, Chaturvedi came into limelight after exposing scams in Haryana forest depart. He faced 12 transfers in five years.

NEP row: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin talks of not paying central taxes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-row-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-m-k-stalin-talks-of-not-paying-central-taxes/articleshow/118462495.cms,"Ditch politics for students’ sake, Pradhan tells Stalin on NEP



CUDDALORE: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin upped the ante on Friday in his run-in with the Modi govt over National Education Policy and devolution of funds, saying it would take DMK ""just one second to say we won't pay tax that Union govt is collecting from the state,"" reports Bosco Dominique. ""Federalism is about give-and-take,"" Stalin said here.Referring to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement that TN stood to lose Rs 5,000 crore for not rolling out PM Shri scheme linked to NEP, Stalin said Centre was jealous of states' growth and was trying to impede their development.Accusing the Centre of not giving states their rightful share of resources, Stalin said: “After sucking out all state taxes through the GST regime, the Union govt is refusing to disburse the dues of states. They are refusing to announce new schemes or release funds even for joint projects of the state and Union govts.”Stalin warned: “Don’t hurl stones at a beehive. Don’t provoke the unique spirit of Tamil people. Don’t seek to witness resurgence of Tamil defiance. As long as I am here, as long as DMK is here, no anti-Tamil, anti-Tamil Nadu, or anti-Tamilian agenda will succeed.”Pradhan countered Stalin’s opposition to NEP, saying TN’s stance was politically motivated and harmful to students. He shared a letter addressed to Stalin on his X handle, mentioning that it was “highly inappropriate” for a state to oppose NEP with a “narrow-minded approach”. Pradhan accused the TN govt of using “intimidation for political reasons”. He said the Modi govt was fully committed to promoting Tamil culture globally and urged TN to “not politicise education” and instead work “beyond political differences in the best interest of our students”. Pradhan argued NE was a transformative policy aimed at modernising India’s education system while preserving linguistic and cultural diversity. Rejecting allegations of Hindi being imposed on southern states, he said, “Let me unequivocally state there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.” Stalin told the gathering in Cuddalore that the “real disaster for India” was the Union govt’s alleged failure to understand the fundamental principle of federalism. “NEP is not designed to promote education but to advance the agenda of making India a homogenous nation,” he said.","Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin upped the ante on Friday in his run-in with the Modi govt over National Education Policy and devolution of funds.

"Been my privilege to be inspired by RSS, connected with Marathi through Sangh: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/been-my-privilege-to-be-inspired-by-rss-connected-with-marathi-through-sangh-pm-modi/articleshow/118462253.cms,"Connected with Marathi through RSS: PM Modi



NEW DELHI: PM Modi Friday linked his political journey and ideology to Marathi language, expressing pride in the fact that a Marathi (Keshav Baliram Hedgewar) had planted the seed of RSS, which is celebrating its centenary year, on Maharashtra's soil.At the inauguration of the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan here, while sharing the dais with Sharad Pawar, Modi said, ""It has been my privilege, along with millions of others, to be inspired by RSS to live for the country.""The remarks acquire significance because of speculation in certain quarters about cooling of vibes between BJP and Sangh.Saying that it was through Sangh that he connected with Marathi language and its traditions, Modi said RSS has been running a ‘sanskar yagya’ for the last 100 years to transmit the great tradition and culture of India to the new generation. RSS was founded in 1925 in Nagpur by Hedgewar.The decision of the organisers, who included Pawar, president of the 98th session of Marathi Sahitya Sabha, to get Modi to inaugurate the Marathi literature festival raised eyebrows in many quarters, besides attracting criticism from NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s INDIA bloc allies.The 148-year-old Marathi literary festival was last held in Delhi in 1954, with renowned lexicographer Tarkatirtha Laxmanshastri Joshi as president. On that occasion, the conference was inaugurated by then-PM Jawaharlal Nehru. The trigger for hosting the event in Delhi was the Modi govt’s decision to confer classical language status on Marathi.On Friday, Modi reciprocated Pawar’s gesture as they shared the dais at the inauguration ceremony. “Today, on the invitation of Sharad Pawar , I am getting the opportunity to join this proud tradition,” Modi said.The audience burst into applause as Modi helped Pawar take his seat and offered him a glass of water. Modi, who was to start the function by lighting the ceremonial lamp, requested Pawar, chairman of the event’s reception committee, to come forward and do the honours with him.Modi highlighted that a few months ago, Marathi was granted the status of classical language — a recognition that over 12 crore Marathi speakers in India and worldwide had awaited for decades. He described it as a great fortune to have had the opportunity to fulfil this long-cherished aspiration.The Prime Minister said the event was taking place at a significant time when the nation was witnessing the 350th anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation, the 300th birth anniversary of Punyashlok Ahilyabai Holkar, and the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, drafted through the efforts of Babasaheb Ambedkar.Modi said the event was not confined to a single language or region, embodying both the essence of the freedom struggle and the cultural heritage of Maharashtra and the nation.Noting that the day coincided with International Mother Language Day, he recited a verse by Sant Dnyaneshwar and explained that the Marathi language inspired his deep love and affection for its culture.The PM said the Marathi language became a proclamation of liberation from invaders, recalling the valour of Maratha warriors like Chhatrapati Shivaji, Sambhaji Maharaj and Bajirao Peshwa, who fiercely opposed their enemies. He noted that during the freedom struggle, figures like Vasudev Balwant Phadke, Lokmanya Tilak and Veer Savarkar disrupted British rule.Modi said Mumbai had emerged as the economic capital not only of Maharashtra but of the entire country. “When speaking of Mumbai, one cannot complete the discussion without mentioning films. It is Maharashtra and Mumbai that have elevated both Marathi films and Hindi cinema,” he said, citing the current popularity of the movie ‘Chhava’, which has brought the valour of Sambhaji Maharaj to the forefront, inspired by Shivaji Sawant’s Marathi novel.","PM Modi: ""It has been my privilege, along with millions of others, to be inspired by RSS to live for the country"" The 148-year-old Marathi literary festival was last held in Delhi in 1954, with renowned lexicographer Tarkatirtha Laxmanshastri Joshi as president.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118462307,imgsize-612079,width-400,resizemode-4/118462307.jpg"

During Misri’s visit, India and China had agreed to resume the pilgrimage and direct flights between the 2 countries.Underlining India and China’s membership of G20, SCO and BRICS, Jaishankar also said that there are also “regional and global issues of mutual interest, where an exchange of perspectives will be to our mutual benefit”. Jaishankar is expected to visit China for a meeting of the SCO foreign ministers later this year, which will be followed by the summit that Beijing expects Modi to attend.The Chinese readout quoted Jaishankar as saying that India is willing to speed up the restoration of cooperation mechanisms with China, enhance cultural exchanges, facilitation of personnel exchanges, and joint maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.“Since our last meeting in Rio during the G20 Summit in November 2024, there have been some notable developments.

Watershed moment for inclusive medicine: Doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watershed-moment-for-inclusive-medicine-doctors/articleshow/118461237.cms,"Doctors TOI spoke to hailed the Supreme Court judgment allowing a student with upper limb disability to get admission for MBBS course. They argued that it was important to have greater diversity among doctors and that it was unfair to pre-judge who could do what.Dr Shah Alam, a senior orthopaedic surgeon at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said he welcomed the judgment as it was important for diversity and because it was wrong to limit the professional options of those with disability. ""Some might say that medicine is about skill, but MBBS is also about theoretical knowledge and learning. The kind of dexterity needed in 'MBBS skills' is easily trainable even for those who have significant physical disabilities. There is a lot of expansion in medicine with many fields not requiring manual skills. Previously, dissection was considered a big part of medicine, especially in early 20th century. Now there are many simulations to learn what was learnt through dissection. Moreover, if the student is managing the chores of his daily life, he surely has enough skills to learn MBBS. The question is what he will do in the future after MBBS. Some fields like interventional cardiology might not be open to him. But not every MBBS doctor becomes an interventional cardiologist or surgeon. With the advancement of science, we don't know what the future holds for this kind of disability,"" said Dr Alam.Dr RS Sindhu, head of department of surgical gastroenterology in Government Medical College Kottayam became the first female surgical gastroenterologist in Kerala despite both her legs being polio affected. ""The medical board pegged my disability at 50%. In my MBBS internship, during the rotation in surgery, I was fascinated by it. I did a further one year in surgery posting and became even more sure that I wanted to be a surgeon. Today, I do liver transplants and all kinds of gastro surgery and I am just completing 23 years as a gastroenterological surgeon, which entails standing for long hours. This student too has the right to study what he feels passionate about,"" said Dr Sindhu.""This is a watershed moment for inclusive medicine in India, as it explicitly challenges the glorified ableism prevalent among medical professionals, whose conscious biases often distort disability assessments.

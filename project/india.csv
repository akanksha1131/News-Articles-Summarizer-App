How the BJP reacted



What the EC said



NEW DELHI: Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has widened his charge of “vote theft”, alleging that the Haryana assembly polls were not an isolated case. Addressing reporters in Panarpani, Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, he claimed that the BJP used the same method in earlier elections as well, including in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.“After seeing the data that I also presented in a press conference about how vote theft took place in Haryana, I think the BJP has done the same thing in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. We have all the evidence and will release it one by one – what we have shown so far is only a little,” he said.Rahul said there was an effort to institutionalise “vote chori”, adding, “There is an attack on democracy and the Constitution of B. R. Ambedkar. PM Modi, Amit Shah, and CEC Gyanesh Kumar are directly involved in it.” He claimed the Congress will release further evidence in phases and asked the youth to “resist this wholesale theft of democracy”.On 5 November, Rahul Gandhi held a press conference where he presented what he called “The H-files”, accusing the BJP of “stealing” the 2024 Haryana assembly election. He cited electoral roll data to claim that 25 lakh entries were fake and the Election Commission had “colluded” with the BJP to ensure its victory.He alleged a “centralised plan” and pointed to a ‘Brazilian model’ whose photograph was used 22 times in 10 booths under names such as “Seema, Sweety and Saraswati”.The congress leader said, “One in eight voters in Haryana are fake and despite that the Congress loses by 22,779 votes which was the difference in eight seats.” Claiming 1,24,177 fake pictures were used, he argued, “You can understand that there was no election in Haryana. There was a theft (of elections) in Haryana and it is very clear who is responsible for the theft.”According to him, “Sarkar Chori” had destroyed democracy and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) was the latest weapon. Rahul alleged that the Election Commission and the BJP ran “Operation Sarkar Chori” to convert a Congress victory into a loss. “Why is the Election Commission not removing duplicates? It is because if it does so, it would result in fair elections and it doesn’t want fair elections,” he said. He also accused the CEC of lying when he said “house number zero” was used for people without formal addresses.He told reporters: “Every single opposition party understands this, they can see this...If the voter list is a lie, there is no democracy. My role as an opposition leader is to let you know the real world that you are living in.” Asked about approaching the courts, Rahul Gandhi responded, “The Supreme Court, the highest court in the country, is watching… it is not hidden.”The BJP dismissed Rahul's claims as “false and baseless”, accusing him of defaming India’s institutions to divert attention from political setbacks. Union minister Kiren Rijiju said he was “raising questions on the Election Commission to hide his failures and defame the country’s democracy.” He accused Gandhi of trying to “instigate the GenZ”, insisting such efforts would not succeed. “The young generation is firmly standing by Modiji,” he said.Rijiju also questioned why the Lok Sabha LoP had not filed complaints before the Election Commission or courts, arguing, “But they do not have to file any appeal before the EC or approach the court. He (Gandhi) will just call a press conference, give a presentation made by someone else and run away,"" he said and asked, ""Will democracy function in such a manner?""Defence minister Rajnath Singh too criticised Rahul Gandhi during a rally in Bihar, saying, “If Rahul Gandhi thinks that the votes of the people of Bihar are being stolen, why does he not file a written complaint with the Election Commission?” Singh accused Gandhi of misleading voters and claimed the Congress was resorting to “lies” for political success.Election Commission (EC) officials told news agency PTI that Rahul Gandhi’s allegations of voter manipulation were “unfounded.” They said no appeals were filed against the electoral rolls and no instances of multiple voting were reported. Responding to Gandhi’s claim that 25 lakh entries were “fake” and that the polls were “stolen,” officials questioned why Congress booth-level agents failed to raise objections during the revision process.(With inputs from agencies)","Rahul Gandhi claims BJP used same method in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.

PM Modi Highlights Legal Reforms, Stresses Need for Law in Local Languages

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Saturday said that ease of getting justice or universal accessibility to the justice delivery system plays a significant role in optimising ease of doing business and ease of living of citizens and that use of technology with a pro-people focus can serve as a force multiplier in this process.Addressing a gathering of constitutional court judges and lawyers at Supreme Court Annexe on Legal Services Day, Modi said that in the last 11 years the govt has focussed on ease of doing business by removing over 40,000 compliances, doing away with 3,400 legal provisions and repealing over 1,500 archaic laws, coupled with revisiting the archaic penal laws.""Ease of doing business and ease of living is possible only when ease of justice is ensured,"" he said, adding that in the last three decades National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has played a vital role in linking commoners to the justice delivery system.Referring to speeches of CJI B R Gavai and CJI-designate Surya Kant on NALSA's efforts to prevent and settle lakhs of disputes through mediation in last three years, the PM said 'community mediation' is an ancient Indian practice that creates harmony and reduces litigation. Highlighting the importance of technology, Modi said, ""Technology can be disruptive. But with pro-people focus, it can be a democratic force."" For instance, UPI has revolutionised digital payments. ""Villages are being linked with optical fibres. One lakh mobile towers are being erected.""Legal professionals, judges and judicial officers must come together to chalk out a plan of action to make the justice delivery system advanced and accessible so that it is in sync with the goal of a developed India by 2047, he said, adding govt has sanctioned over Rs 7,000 crore for the judiciary's technological upgrade. The marginalised will not get justice until they are made aware of their rights. HCs and district courts must follow SC initiative to translate judgments into 18 different languages.""The language of justice must be understood by the litigants. Only then will there be increased compliance and less litigation,"" Modi said.CJI Gavai said NALSA has given rise to hope among the hopeless, marginalised and exploited class of citizens that someone will stand up for them somewhere for protection of their rights.""The system should not be reactive but proactive to prevent abuse of rights,"" he said. NALSA executive chairman and CJI-designate Kant said, ""The true measure of a justice system is not how swiftly it decides complex cases, but how deeply it touches the lives of ordinary citizens.""While echoing the importance given by PM to the role of technology, Justice Kant said, ""Technology does offer real opportunities like online conciliations and digital complaint portals, but technology alone will not suffice. It must be guided by local knowledge, linguistic accessibility and human empathy.""","PM Modi flagged off four Vande Bharat Express trains from Varanasi.

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This was evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Eight members of a gang were arrested over the last two weeks.

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

What is the Green Card lottery?









The US State Department announced that they are implementing certain changes to the Green Card lottery, also known as the Diversity Visa entry process. ""We will announce the start date for the DV-2027 registration period as soon as practicable, as well as the date that DV-2027 selection results may become available through the Entry Status Check (ESC). These changes will not affect the visa application period for individuals selected for DV-2027, which will remain October 1, 2026, to September 30, 2027,"" the department said.Owing to these changes, the lottery has been delayed. The department said that they are aware that there are some fraudulent claims that DV-2027 is open.""The Diversity Visa (DV) 2027 entry registration period is not open at this time. We are aware of reports of fraudulent claims that DV-2027 entry is open and of individuals and services falsely claiming they can increase your chances of selection. This is not true. DV-2027 registration dates and details about changes to this year's process will be announced by the Department of State when available,"" the department said.This program offers thousands of individuals from countries with historically low US immigration rates a chance to obtain permanent residency. The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program was established by Congress in 1990 and signed into law by former President George H.W.Bush. It is limited to 55,000 visas annually. Applicants must meet statutory eligibility requirements, including a high school education or two years of qualifying work experience, among other criteria.The DV Program’s 2026 cycle excluded applicants from the following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Venezuela and Vietnam.",US State Department said they will announce the changes to Green Card lottery 2027 and the registration has not yet begun.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Also read:





: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.

Chennai: At least 136 MBBS seats in the state, including 22 in govt medical colleges and nine seats in AIIMS-Madurai, were vacant after three rounds of counselling by Centre's medical counselling committee, as students who were allotted seats did not join the respective institutions. The committee has said that 802 MBBS seats across India are vacant.""These seats are in the seat matrix for the stray round. They are likely to be filled as the penalty for not joining the seats allotted in the stray round is higher,"" said a senior official of the counselling committee. The committee holds online counselling for admissions to Central medical institutions, 15% all India quota seats in state-run medical colleges and deemed universities. Seats are allotted based on merit. Yet, at the end of three rounds of counselling, 389 seats under all-India quota, 334 seats in deemed universities, and 38 seats in Central institutions, besides seats under quotas from Jain minorities, NRIs, and children/widows of armed forces, were vacant.Experts say faulty rules lead to delayed medical admissions almost every year. ""All seats were allotted in the third round.A student is allotted a college only when he or she opts for it,"" said student counsellor Manickavel Arumugam. In the first round, students are allowed to exit (not join colleges) and apply for the second round. ""In the third round, the penalty for not joining the allotted colleges is 10,000 for govt institutions and 2 lakh for deemed universities.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Also read:

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida. Sector 116 - which covers the 7x sectors - recorded the highest AQI at 357, followed by Sector 125 at 347, Sector 62 at 345, and Sector 1 at 341, all in the very poor range.Nisha Rai, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida's Sector 77, said people in the area have been facing respiratory problems. ""People in the area are suffering from sore throats and breathing difficulties. We don't see water sprinkling being done, and the sky remains grey. We have also stopped outdoor activities,"" she said.Shreya Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Pratishtha in Sector 75, said the AOA has started sprinkling water on its own. ""There is rampant construction in the neighbourhood, and trucks and dumpers carrying materials create dust. However, there is no official check on such activities. We have advised children to stay indoors during morning and evening hours when pollution levels are high,"" she said.In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V recorded an AQI of 322 and Knowledge Park III 328, both in the same category.Manish Kumar, a resident of Supertech Eco Village 1, said most roads in the area are covered in dust. ""There is no mechanical sweeping in Greater Noida West, and construction materials are transported and stored uncovered. We submitted a letter to the environment minister on Friday, seeking his intervention,"" he said.In Ghaziabad, Vasundhara was at 388 and Loni 364, in the very poor category, while Sanjay Nagar and Indirapuram were in the poor range at 298 and 278.Meanwhile, Delhi's overall AQI stood at 361 - among the worst readings this season. By 10pm, the hourly AQI was 385 and 20 out of the 36 monitoring stations have turned severe. However, the stricter restrictive measures under Graded Response Action Plan stage-III are yet to be implemented, and only preventive and advisory measures continue under GRAP-II. Officials at Commission for Air Quality Management, however, said stage-III would kick in only after AQI turned 400 or worse.Meanwhile, the city recorded the lowest minimum temperature for Nov on Saturday at 11 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal against Friday's 12.7 degrees.","Saturday was Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal.

AGRA: A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in Agra for murdering her husband after he opposed their relationship. Statements by the couple's children before the magistrate on their mother's involvement in an extra-marital affair proved crucial in the case. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on each of the convicts.The couple's eldest son, 15 years then, had stated: ""My mother is in a two-year affair with a man named Sunil Kumar. Whenever that man visited our place, she used to beat me and my siblings. I saw him and Dharmveer near my house many times. I also alerted my father about them... When my father, an auto driver, used to go out, Sunil used to quietly come and stay in a room with my mom."" His younger siblings - 13 and 8 - made similar claims before the magistrate.ADGC Pradeep Sharma said on February 14, 2019, when Ramveer Singh, 34, went missing from home, his uncle, Tikaram, launched a manhunt. Failing to trace him, Tikaram approached police to file a missing complaint. An FIR was registered two days later against Singh's wife, Kusuma Devi, then 28, lover Sunil Kumar, 28, and Dharmveer Singh, 32, both auto drivers, under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destroying evidence) at Dauki after Singh's body was found in a village well.The postmortem report revealed 12 injury marks and death due to coma as a result of anti-mortem injury. Prime suspect Kusuma was thereafter arrested on February 17, and police also found the large stick used to beat her husband to death. A burnt phone was recovered too. The other two accused were held on February 19; chargesheet was filed on May 13 that year.During trial, the accused rejected their involvement in Singh's murder and attempted to mislead court by trying to project the latter's proximity to local goons, which led to the killing. However, statements by Kusuma's kids in favour of their dad nailed the trio. Taking witness testimonies, autopsy findings and police evidence into consideration, additional district and sessions judge Sanjay Lal punished the convicts on Friday.","A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in Agra.

The judge also said the sale proceeds deposited in the form of FDs will be distributed to the aggrieved lenders.The application was moved by GGL's liquidator under the PMLA Act. It was submitted that the committee of creditors (CoC) initiated proceedings for liquidation by passing a resolution in 2019.

NEW DELHI: On a long standing litigation between Mumbai and Bengaluru factions of Iskcon over control of Bengaluru temple, Supreme Court had kept the verdict reserved for more than a year and gave judgment favouring the Bengaluru branch in May just prior to the retirement of presiding judge Justice A S Oka.The bench of Justices Oka and A G Masih had set aside Karnataka High Court's detailed judgment in May 2011 giving control of the Bengaluru temple to the Mumbai branch. High Court had quashed the trial court decree of April 2009 which was in favour of the Bengaluru faction.After 14 years of the HC verdict and six months of Supreme Court judgment, pronounced a week before Justice Oka's retirement, the parties are now almost back to square one as a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih (who was part of the bench led by Justice Oka) delivered a split verdict on the Mumbai branch's plea for review of the May 16 judgment.Justice Maheshwari found that the Mumbai branch has made out a case for review of the judgment. In his two sentence order, he said, ""Applications for listing the review petitions in open court are allowed. Notice be issued to the parties."" This would mean Justice Maheshwari felt that the Mumbai branch should be allowed to argue its case in open court pointing out the ""error apparent"" in the judgment.On the other hand, Justice Masih said, ""After having carefully gone through the review petitions, the judgment under review and the material annexed therewith, I am satisfied there is no error apparent on the face of record or any merit in the review petitions, warranting reconsideration of the judgment impugned.The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed.""""In view of the divergent views... the review petitions be placed before the CJI for directions and to do the needful,"" the bench then said.Iskcon-Mumbai had consistently maintained that the Bengaluru faction had never functioned as an independent entity and had always operated under the Mumbai branch, and hence, the management of the temple vested with the Mumbai faction. But the trial court had allowed the Bengaluru branch's suit, and given a decree in its favour over the management of the temple affairs.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Why GRAP 3 not yet enforced?



NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (AQI) crossed 400-mark, making the situation adverse for Delhiites and the citizens in the national capital region.With a 24-hour average AQI of 361, Delhi became the country’s second most polluted city, according to CPCB data. Several areas, including Wazirpur (420), Burari (418), and Vivek Vihar (411), recorded ""severe"" pollution levels, while most others hovered in the ‘very poor’ range. In the NCR, Noida (354), Greater Noida (336), and Ghaziabad (339) also reported hazardous air, underscoring the region’s worsening smog crisis.The air quality early warning system for Delhi has forecast that the city’s air will stay in the ‘very poor’ category for the coming days. Since Diwali, the capital’s air quality has largely hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’, at times deteriorating to ‘severe’ levels.Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) stage 3 has not been enforced yet because, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the city’s air quality this November has remained comparatively better than the same period last year.Officials said that pollution levels have not yet reached the severe threshold that would trigger Stage 3 restrictions. They credited this improvement to timely and coordinated actions across departments, including intensified dust control, road cleaning, anti-smog operations, and stricter checks on vehicles and industrial emissions, which have helped delay the need for harsher measures.""Out of the last seven days, six have recorded better air quality than the corresponding days last year. This has been possible because of timely and coordinated action taken across departments,"" PTI quoted an official saying.""Last year, GRAP Stage 3 was imposed on November 13. This time, with support from all departments and the residents of Delhi, we hope to prevent reaching that stage,"" the official said.","The national capital on Saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (AQI) crossed 400-mark.

""It is necessary that government conducts a proper investigation and makes facts public,"" he told reporters in Akola, breaking his silence on the row.The Rs 300 crore-deal related to transfer of 40 acres of government-owned land in Mundhwa, Pune, to a company in which Parth is one of two partners has been cancelled, Ajit said Friday after it attracted much criticism.Pawar sr brushed aside questions on why his daughter Supriya Sule seemed to be going ""soft"" on Parth amid the row, saying ""family and politics"" are different aspects. Asked why Supriya had ""defended"" Parth, he said, ""That's her personal opinion.""Asked why Parth had not been named in the FIR lodged in Pune in the case, Pawar said, ""Only the home minister (CM Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio) can provide accurate information on this. He's in the best position to say.""Hours later, Fadnavis told mediapersons in Gadchiroli that ""action is being taken as per law and there's no question of saving anybody"".Pawar sr, however, avoided dragging deputy CM Ajit and Parth into the controversy by limiting his response to asking for a fair probe.He said members within the Pawar family have been political rivals but that should not be mixed with family relations. ""My grandnephew (Yugendra Pawar) contested against Ajit. Within the family we have fought elections against each other,"" he said, adding that social, family and political relations should be seen in silos.On Friday, Supriya refrained from taking on Parth, unlike other Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies like Congress. Sule had said, ""I called Parth and he said he has not done anything wrong. If it was govt land, how was it sold? CM and the revenue minister should come out with all details.""Pawar, the architect of MVA, also said the inclusion of Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena into MVA fold must be a ""collective decision"". Responding to questions about Congress being reluctant to include MNS in the alliance, Pawar said, ""Leaders of the alliance should sit together and take a joint decision. Congress should not take an extreme position in haste."" He added a meeting of MVA is scheduled in a day or two, where clarity is expected.Regarding a potential alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, Pawar said, ""Some people met him recently, but the talks didn't progress further.""On Rahul Gandhi's allegations about voter fraud, Pawar said this cannot be brushed aside by authorities. ""EC must address vote rigging concerns. They must clear all doubts on vote theft to maintain public trust in democracy.""","Sharad Pawar says Maharashtra government must conduct a fair investigation into the controversial Pune land deal.

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled

NEW DELHI: Union minister and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Friday dismissed speculation about a possible change of guard in the southern state, asserting that it would not be “easy” for the ruling Congress to replace incumbent chief minister Siddaramaiah “There will be no chief minister change in Karnataka as is being speculated. It is not easy for the Congress party to remove him,” Kumaraswamy told reporters in Bengaluru, according to news agency PTI.The Janata Dal (Secular) leader described the Congress stalwart as a “capable leader,” noting that he knows this well since Siddaramaiah had earlier been part of the JD(S).“He (Siddaramaiah) was with us earlier; others don’t know what he is. As he was with us earlier, we know what he is capable of doing,” Kumaraswamy said.Rumours of a leadership change have been circulating in Karnataka, with some suggesting it could happen after November 20 — the halfway mark of the Congress government’s five-year term that began in May 2023 — a period some political observers have dubbed the “November Revolution.”“I don’t have any belief in revolutions. Discussions have been going on about a revolution, but there will be none in my opinion,” Kumaraswamy remarked.When asked about deputy chief minister and state Congress chief DK Shivakumar’s chances of succeeding Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy took a swipe, saying, “He (Shivakumar) discusses with God every day about when he will be made the chief minister. It is between him and God.”Reacting to Shivakumar’s statement that a “revolution” would happen only in 2028 ""when the Congress returns to power again,"" Kumaraswamy added, “Many in this state in the past have said they will be chief minister or in power for the next ten or twenty years. You have seen what happened to them. Let’s see what happens.”Siddaramaiah, who joined the Congress in 2006 after being expelled from the JD(S) led by former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, has recently reiterated that he intends to serve the full five-year term, subject to the Congress high command’s ""decision.""",HD Kumaraswamy dismisses speculation about a possible change of guard in Karnataka.

Akola SIT case

to be posted before CJI for assigning another bench

NEW DELHI: After Maharashtra government took exception and sought review of a September 11 order of a two-judge Supreme Court bench to set up an SIT comprising police officers from Hindu and Muslim communities to probe certain crimes during 2023 Akola communal riots, the same judges gave a split verdict - one allowing the review, the other dismissing it.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, on behalf of Maharashtra, had pleaded before a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma that it would set a dangerous precedent as for every riot the police investigation must be done by assigning probes to officers depending on their personal faith when the police force is secular.The review petition said the direction for setting up of an SIT would be implemented but the state had taken exception to the direction as far as it impinged on the principle of institutional secularism. Justice Sharma said, ""In the considered opinion of this court as review and recall has been sought of the judgment to the limited extent that 'it directs or mandates the composition of the SIT on the basis of religious identity' requires consideration and, therefore, let notice be issued to the respondents, returnable within two weeks. ""But Justice Sanjay Kumar was furious over the filing of the review petition and condemned the manner in which the state made separate mentioning of the plea before both judges on the bench, without disclosing that the other was also being approached.Rejecting the review petition, Justice Kumar said the directions for including officers from both communities in the SIT was issued because of the laxity on part of police to register FIRs and probe the two crimes during the riots. Given the split verdict, the matter would now be posted before the CJI for assigning the review petition to another bench.Justice Kumar said, ""As the case related to communal riots..., and the hues of this case prima facie hinted at a religious bias, it was necessary to direct constitution of an investigation team comprising senior police officers of both communities so as to maintain transparency and fairness in the investigation. Needless to state, that should be the objective of the police machinery in the state of Maharashtra but, unfortunately, that did not happen in the case on hand. """"In such circumstances, constitution of an investigation team comprising members of both communities involved in the riot would go a long way in ensuring and safeguarding the transparency and fairness of the investigation...""","A two-judge Supreme Court bench ordered police officers from Hindu and Muslim communities to probe certain crimes during 2023 Akola communal riots.

Congress slammed the announcement, saying it implied the PM Modi government would not allow debates on any issues to be raised by the opposition, and the government has no official business to transact either.AICC spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said the 20-day session will have merely 15 working days.""What is the message being conveyed? Clearly, the government has no business to transact, no bills to get passed, and no debates to be allowed."" TMP MP Derek O'Brien said government has ""Parliament-Ophobia"", describing it as a fear of facing the Parliament. ""15-day Winter Session announced. Setting dubious records,"" he said on X.Rijiju said, ""As if Congress netas are interested in running Parliament! But I will never get tired of repeatedly appealing Congress to participate in Parliament debates and discussions and also not to create obstacles for other sincere MPs.""",The three-week session will have 15 sittings in all. It comes in the midst of the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. The monsoon session of Parliament also saw vociferous protests by several opposition parties over the SIR in Bihar.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125195501,imgsize-1557495,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-8.jpg"

Civic Woes, Star Candidate And High-Stakes Contest: Ground Report From Chapra Ahead Of Bihar Polls

SITAMARHI: In the heart of Bihar's Mithilanchal, where air carries the scent of Maithili folk songs and the pain of annual floods - though people had a respite this monsoon - 2025 assembly polls have boiled down to faith, jobs and local pride.NDA is banking on Ramayan symbolism and development pledges to hold its ground, while opposition Mahagathbandhan has played the migration and unemployment cards to counter the ""susashan"" narrative of incumbent Nitish Kumar, which is central to the ""double engine"" plank of the alliance, along with PM Modi's charisma.The buzz started when Union minister Amit Shah performed ""bhoomi pujan"" at Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi, the birthplace of Sita. NDA has promised massive redevelopment along the lines of Ayodhya, which includes a greenfield city, Sitapuram. Land acquisition is nearly done, and construction - funded through crowdfunding - will soon begin on a 68-acre complex costing Rs 890 crore.This pledge extends beyond Punaura. The project is a part of the Ramayana Circuit: Rs 52 crore for Valmiki Nagar, Rs 31 crore for Pulhar in Madhubani, Rs 24 crore for Panth Pakar in Sitamarhi, Rs 23 crore for Ahilya spot, Rs 13 crore for Ram Reka Ghat and Rs 7 crore for Sita Kund in Munger-Gaya.People in the region see the initiative as a boost to Mithila's identity where NDA's confidence is soaring amid a diverse mix of Yadavs, EBCs (36% as per 2023 caste survey), Muslims and upper caste Maithils.The promise of restarting Riga Sugar Mill, shut for over five years, has made locals hopeful. ""This will bring jobs back to our fields,"" says Ram Kripal, a farmer.NDA candidate Vaidyanath Prasad is locked in a tough fight with MGB's Congress pick Amit Kumar Tunna. Congress is hammering the ""local vs outsider"" point, painting Prasad as an import since he hails from Sheohar. Yet, NDA's edge is evident: in 2020, it had won 30 of Mithilanchal's 46 seats; in 2024 Lok Sabha polls, it swept all seven parliamentary segments here.Mithilanchal covers 10-12 districts: Darbhanga and Madhubani (10 seats each, NDA strongholds), Muzaffarpur and Samastipur (10 each, Yadav-EBC battles), Sitamarhi (6, migration woes), Saharsa (5), Supaul (3), Madhepura (3), Sheohar (1), and bits of Vaishali-Begusarai.Over 70 lakh voters, including 10 lakh first timers, will be eligible to cast votes in the second phase of polling on Nov 11. Women, whose turnout was 59% in 2024 Lok Sabha polls, have been wooed through schemes like aid for 1.51 crore Jeevika sisters, a factor which could be the most decisive one in case NDA maintains its winning streak.NDA's ""M3 Strategy"" - Mithila, Music, Mahila - is on show with folk singer Maithili Thakur as the star campaigner in 20+ seats. She draws the youth, countering migration blues. PM Modi and Shah have pushed ""Modiwaad + Nitishwaad,"" promising IT jobs, sugar mill revivals, and a classical language tag for Maithili.MGB, led by Tejashwi Yadav's RJD, is eyeing gains of 10-15 seats, hoping EBC voters will boost its Yadav-Muslim constituency. Tejashwi conducted rallies in Samastipur-Madhubani, promising one crore jobs, double panchayat pay and pensions. But seat-sharing woes -friendly fights on eight seats - and 'jungle raj' jibes are set to hurt MGB.Besides, AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi has fielded four candidates (in Jale, Bisfi, Keoti, Darbhanga town), splitting the Muslim vote. Jan Suraaj is contesting all 46 seats. It remains to be seen whom the new entrant will hurt the most, given that the fight is largely between the two alliances.","NDA is banking on Ramayan symbolism and development pledges to hold its ground.

Tarar’s profile now shows the message: “@TararAttaullah has been withheld in IN in response to a legal demand.”This move comes just days after Tarar had accused India of planning imminent military action. On Tuesday, he had claimed Pakistan had ""credible intelligence"" of an Indian strike within 24 to 36 hours and criticised what he called India’s “hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner.”Just a couple of days before Tarar’s account was withheld, Pakistan defence minister Khwaja Asif's account faced a similar block in India. Asif had earlier after admitted in an interview that Pakistan had historically supported and trained terrorist groups, calling it a “mistake” done on behalf of the US and Western allies.India has also banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels accused of spreading provocative and misleading content in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Collectively, these channels had over 63 million subscribers.The border situation between the two-nuclear armed neighbours has worsened significantly since the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which left 26 people dead, most of them tourists.Since then, Pakistani troops have engaged in nightly exchanges of small arms fire across multiple sectors along the Line of Control (LoC), including Kupwara, Uri, Akhnoor, and Naushera, with Indian Army responding proportionately. Officials say the firing was unprovoked, violating the 2003 ceasefire agreement reaffirmed in 2021.India responded to the Pahalgam attack by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty and closing its airspace to Pakistani aircraft. A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was issued to restrict Pakistani-operated or -registered aircraft from entering Indian airspace until at least May 23. Diplomatic ties have also been strained further with the closure of the Wagah border, the suspension of trade, and a reduction in the number of diplomatic officers on both sides.",Pakistan's information and broadcasting minister Attaullah Tarar's account was withheld in India.

"Traffic violation may earn negative points, lead to DL suspension & cancellation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-violation-may-earn-negative-points-lead-to-dl-suspension-cancellation/articleshow/120840849.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: Aiming to rein in errant drivers and repeat offenders, the road transport ministry is planning to introduce a negative points system on driving licences (DLs) for offences such as jumping signals and speeding. Once the accumulated negative points cross the defined threshold, the DL can be suspended or cancelled. These negative points would be in addition to existing fines and penalties.The ministry shared the overall framework of the proposal, as a part of overhauling the DL regime, at a brainstorming session on road safety with stakeholders, including state govt representatives, experts and non-govt organisations this week.Countries such as Australia, UK, Germany, Brazil, France and Canada use a point system to track and penalise repeat offenders.Officials said the “demerit and merit” point licencing system will be included in the Motor Vehicles Act when it seeks amendments to the law in the next couple of months. “While demerit points will be assigned for violation of traffic rules, merit points would be rewarded for good driver behaviour and to good samaritans,” said an official.Increase in fines and penalties introduced since 2019 has not brought the desired results as road deaths and injuries have increased to more than 1.7 lakh in a year. Sources said the extended penalty which can result in suspension or cancellation of DLs would be a bigger deterrent going by the global experience. They added that with the increased electronic recording of offences now the enforcement agencies concerned can track the penalty points using handheld devices for taking immediate action.In 2011, an expert committee on “Review of MV Act” headed by former road transport secretary S Sunder had recommended the “penalty point system for drivers” with details of such points for every offence. It had recommended suspension of DLs for one year, if the total number of accumulated points crossed 12 in three years. If a driver whose licence has been suspended, again accumulated 12 points, his DL would be cancelled for five years.The govt’s plan also includes mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of existing licence, if they have violated traffic rules. At present, driving test is exempted if one applies for DL renewal before its expiry. “The moves are aimed at enhancing overall road safety,” said another official.The ministry will also make mandatory provision of obtaining learners licence for electric vehicles of less than 1,500 watts and maximum design speed of 25 kmph. It will introduce graded eligibility for obtaining learners’ licences.","The road transport ministry is planning to introduce a negative points system on driving licences (DLs) for offences such as jumping signals and speeding.

Rs 2 bribe leads to SC ruling - Stamp vendors are public servants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2-bribe-leads-to-sc-ruling-stamp-vendors-are-public-servants/articleshow/120840706.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Conviction of a stamp vendor under Prevention of Corruption Act for charging Rs 2 extra for a Rs 10 stamp paper in Dec 2003 kept the three-tier judiciary engaged for almost 22 years to find answer to the question - Is a stamp vendor a public servant and is he liable under anti-corruption law ?Two constitutional courts – the Delhi HC and the Supreme Court – cumulatively deliberated for 16 years and on Friday, the SC ruled that stamp vendors are public servants, which will bring lakhs of them in states within the ambit of PC Act. But the stamp vendor who sparked the debate, was acquitted by SC after two decades.The incident happened at the Sub-Registrar’s office at Janakpuri on Dec 9, 2003, when a stamp vendor demanded Rs 12 for selling a Rs 10 stamp paper and on exchange of chemical-laced currency notes, he was caught by anti-corruption bureau and proceeded under PC Act on charges of corruption.The trial court convicted him under PC Act in 2008, termed him to be a public servant and sentenced him to one year imprisonment with a fine of Rs 1000. The Delhi HC took six years to decide the issue - Whether a stamp vendor is a public servant for the purposes of the PC Act? – and penned a lengthy judgment to concur with the trial court.The appeal by the convicted stamp vendor remained pending with the SC for 11 years. On Friday a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan acquitted him for lack of evidence and overturned concurrent finding of guilt by the trial court and the HC.In a 45-page judgment, the SC ruled that “stamp vendors across the country, by virtue of performing an important public duty and receiving remuneration from the Government for the discharge of such duty, are undoubtedly public servants within the ambit of Section 2(c)(i) of the PC Act.”Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said as the legislature has given a wide and comprehensive definition of ‘public servant’ to curb the menace of corruption, “It is the nature of duty being discharged by a person which assumes paramount importance when determining whether such a person falls within the ambit of the definition of public servant as defined under the PC Act.”The bench said since the licence to become a stamp vendor is issued by the govt and is entitled to receive a discount on the stamp paper he sells, he would certainly be treated as a person ‘remunerated by the govt’ for the purpose of PC Act.","The incident happened at the Sub-Registrar’s office at Janakpuri on Dec 9, 2003.

'Nobody came to know': Congress' Channi questions surgical strike; BJP calls it 'insult to armed forces',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nobody-came-to-know-congress-channi-questions-surgical-strike-bjp-calls-it-insult-to-armed-forces/articleshow/120839805.cms,"'Congress has become Pakistan parast party': BJP

Channi issues clarification

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi sparked outrage by questioning the credibility of India’s surgical strikes in Pakistan, saying he had “never seen where the strike took place.” The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) came down heavily on Channi, accusing him of disrespecting the armed forces and playing politics over national security .Speaking at a press conference following the Pahalgam terror attack, in which 26 people were killed, Channi said, “Till date, I could not find where the (surgical) strike took place, where men were killed at that time, and where this happened in Pakistan. Will we not find out if a bomb is dropped in our country? They say that they did a surgical strike in Pakistan. Nothing had happened. Nowhere was a surgical strike seen. Nobody came to know… I have always demanded (proof).”Channi also took a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, “People are waiting for the 56-inch chest to act”. He went on to say, “We have never seen where in Pakistan the strikes were done and where people were killed.”His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from BJP leaders, who accused the Congress of undermining national security. BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said Channi had a pattern of insulting India’s forces. “In 2024, he disgustingly commented 'stuntbaazi' when Corporal Vicky Pahade was martyred. Now, he insults the armed forces again, saying they (the Army) said that we did a surgical strike on Pakistan, but nobody saw it,” Kesavan said.Delhi BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said Channi’s comments reflect the ""dirty mentality of the Gandhi family."" He asked, “What kind of mentality is this of the Congress party, the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi, that they keep questioning the army, the Indian Air Force?” Sirsa added, “Pakistan itself is saying that India has caused a lot of damage by conducting surgical strikes.”""Charanjit Singh Channi has again shown the dirty politics and dirty mentality of the Gandhi family, who always question the army and demoralise the forces. I condemn this,"" he further said.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also attacked the Congress, branding it the “Pakistan Prast Party” for repeatedly seeking evidence of India’s military actions.""Congress has become Pakistan parast party (PPP). Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says no action should be taken against Pakistan... Robert Vadra and other Congress party leaders have given a clean chit to Pakistan and blamed Hindutva... When the whole country is standing behind the army so that they can give a befitting reply to the terrorists, the Congress party is hurting the morale of the army,"" Poonawalla said.After the backlash, Channi attempted to clarify his stance, claiming he was not demanding proof of the strikes but calling for justice for the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""I have said earlier also that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government. If the government disrupts their (Pakistan's) water supply, air or whatever action it takes, we are standing like a rock with it,"" he said.“There is nothing about surgical (strike) today. Its proof is not asked for, and I am not asking for it either… Don't try to divert this. The innocent tourists who were killed after being asked about their religion—those families want justice today,” he added.Earlier on Friday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) while expressing full support to the victims' families, passed a resolution urging the Centre to act decisively against Pakistan.

US govt wants Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation suit shifted; judge pushes back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-govt-wants-indian-national-badar-khan-suris-deportation-suit-shifted-judge-pushes-back/articleshow/120839211.cms,"The US government on Thursday asked a federal judge to transfer Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation case from Virginia to Texas, where he is currently being held on charges of ""spreading Hamas propaganda.""At the hearing, US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles expressed doubt about the government's petition, which would require her to dismiss the Virginia case, the Associated Press reported.She emphasised that dismissal would invalidate her March directive to keep Badar Khan Suri within the US during his First Amendment proceedings.Justice Department attorney David Byerley indicated he would consult with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement regarding the judge's concerns. He expressed confidence that ICE would respect her deportation stay order whilst the case transfers to Texas federal court.""OK,"" the judge responded. ""I'm not going to rely on that. But thank you,"" she added.In a court filing ahead of the hearing, US attorneys argued that Badar Khan Suri’s lawsuit should have been filed in Texas, not Virginia, since he was already moved out of the state. They called the transfer a ""straightforward"" legal matter.The Trump administration said it relocated Khan Suri from a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, to Louisiana and then Texas due to overcrowding.However, the judge Giles appeared doubtful about that explanation. She asked the government to provide specific data on how many beds were available in Farmville at the time of Suri’s arrest and how many detainees have actually been transferred for overcrowding.Khan Suri's attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union told the judge that he initially slept on the floor in an overcrowded Texas facility for several weeks, though he now occupies an individual cell.His legal representatives suggested the transfer to Texas aimed to secure a more conservative judicial hearing. Attorney Vishal Agraharkar accused the government of engaging in ""forum shopping.""The federal courts in Texas and western Louisiana feature predominantly Republican-appointed judges, unlike Alexandria, Virginia's US District Court.Appeals proceed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit, one of 13 federal appellate courts nationwide, comprises 17 full-time judges. Twelve received appointments from Republican presidents, including six during Donald Trump's presidency.Outside the Alexandria courthouse on Thursday, Hassan Ahmad, another lawyer representing Khan Suri, reinforced Agraharkar's courtroom statements. ""There is a reason why the detention facilities exist there,"" Ahmad said, further noting that, ""This kind of rigged game has to stop,"" he said.His legal team said that his arrest and imprisonment were unconstitutional, stemming from his wife's Gaza connections. They assert that Khan Suri and his spouse, Mapheze Saleh, faced targeting because Saleh's father worked with Gaza's Hamas-supported administration before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, came to the US in 2022 on a J-1 visa and works at Georgetown University as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He and his wife Saleh have three children—a 9-year-old son and 5-year-old twins.

She was saved at the last moment.”The newlyweds were just about settling in when the April 22 Pakistan-backed terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam tore their lives asunder along with those of many others.Lawyer Sharma cited a clarification from MHA that the order cancelling visas to Pakistanis wasn’t applicable to diplomatic and long-term visas.“Meenal was interviewed and recommended a long-term visa before the deportation exercise triggered by the Pahalgam attack started,” he said.On whether a Islamic marriage solemnised online by a qazi was legally valid, the lawyer said the Union govt recognised the wedding by issuing a visa to Meenal “as the wife of Munir Khan”.While the high court didn’t stay Meenal’s deportation, it said she should be allowed to stay in Jammu until her visa status was clear. The case will be next heard on May 14.The court said the onus was on the Union govt to decide whether a long-term visa should be issued to Munir’s wife, also noting that her short-term visa had lapsed more than a month ago.","Pakistan national Meenal Ahmed Khan was reunited with her husband, CRPF trooper Munir Khan, on J&K high court’s orders this week.

He added that this shift could boost revenue retention and create new opportunities in Kerala.The Rs 8,800 crore Vizhinjam project is India's first dedicated transshipment hub with its natural depth of nearly 20 metres allowing large ships to berth, something that is not possible at the smaller ports in the country.Modi linked the project to India's broader maritime strategy, referring to Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision and India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor announced at the G20 summit. While the port itself was under development for years, much of the construction and equipment involved private sector collaboration, particularly Adani Ports , which is operating the terminal.In a lighter vein, PM also commented on the role of private investment in the project. ""When the people of Gujarat learn that Adani built such a great port in Kerala, after working on a port in Gujarat for 30 years without building anything like this, they'll be upset with him,"" he said, drawing laughter from the audience.Highlighting govt's focus on maritime development in past 10 years, Modi mentioned about the 30% reduction in turnaround time of ships at India's major ports. He also said the reformed regulations concerning Indian seafarers, was yielding significant results. While in 2014, the number of Indian seafarers was little over 1.2 lakh, today this has surged beyond 3.2 lakh.The event, held on the birth anniversary of Adi Shankaracharya - a figure Modi often mentioned - highlighted Kerala's growing importance in India's economic and maritime plans. Modi linked the port's opening to the spiritual legacy of the Kerala-born philosopher, saying his teachings laid the foundation for unity and that Kerala is now being positioned as a key part of India's economic future.The port was inaugurated at a time when Kerala's economy faces rising debt and limited fiscal space, with the state govt seeking more central assistance.

Court nixes complaint against Gulmarg fashion show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-nixes-complaint-against-gulmarg-fashion-show/articleshow/120833561.cms,"Elle India

SRINAGAR: A Srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers Shivan and Narresh and unidentified models over a fashion show held on ski resort Gulmarg’s snowy slopes this March.The court observed that the complaint, which included two screenshots showing one male and one female model in skimpy clothing, did not meet the legal standard for the offence of obscenity “in the broader scheme of the event”. The March 7 fashion show, during the holy month of Ramadan, had stirred a row and a political storm in Muslim-majority J&K, with chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq leading the offensive.“The complainant has affixed two screenshots showing one female and one male model in skimpy clothes. That is the sole fact appearing in the complaint alleged to be obscene. Accused on the other hand has placed on record material which show that in the fashion show several models participated, and the two models wearing skimpy clothes actually were showcasing swim wear for which the company of first accused has expertise,” special court judge Faizan Nazar held in his order on Thursday.Adil Ahmad Khan, a civilian, had filed the complaint, also naming the editor-in-chief ofmagazine, which ran Instagram reels from the show.The judge also dismissed claims of “outraging religious feelings”, observing that no court could take cognisance of a complaint filed by a private person in an offence under Section 299 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (which prohibits insulting religious beliefs) without the prior sanction of the central or state govt.Mirwaiz had slammed the event as “outrageous” and “obscene.” Governing National Conference (NC) MP and Shia cleric Aga Ruhullah Mehdi called the show “shocking”. BJP’s J&K president Sunil Sharma blamed chief minister Omar Abdullah, saying the models and designers stayed at Nedous Hotel, owned by the CM’s relatives.Omar had acknowledged the hotel belonged to his relatives but denied any involvement with the show. Designer duo Shivan and Narresh issued an apology on March 9, saying their sole intention was to “celebrate creativity without any desire to offend anyone or religious sentiments”. Elle India responded by deleting the 0.35-second Instagram. reel.Despite the apologies, Khan filed the court complaint, saying he was “deeply hurt”. The fashion show, including its attire, choreography and behaviour of the participants were obscene and offensive, with its contents explicitly sexualised and disrespectful to the religious and cultural sensibilities of Muslims and Kashmiri culture in the holy month of Ramadan, Khan argued.Khan had also alleged offences under J&K Excise Act, 1958, which proscribes drinking in public or places of worship. The judge rejected this charge, saying the law barred taking cognisance of private complaints. The court further pointed out that Nedous Hotel had a four-hour permit for serving liquor on the day of the show.","A Srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers Shivan and Narresh and unidentified models.

"Thank your parents, even when they’re difficult",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thank-your-parents-even-when-theyre-difficult/articleshow/120826566.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

I was in a meeting and my phone on silent, when an unknown number lit up the screen repeatedly. Seven missed calls.

Once the session ended, I called back. A voice—low and hurried- answered. “Amma, driver here. They aren’t taking sir to the hospital. He’s very sick. Please don’t tell them I called you.” The line went dead. It took me a moment to recognize the driver.

His ‘sir’ was no ordinary person. A distant relative, he had been a businessman of stature. I remember visiting his office with my father, for his new office inauguration and dinner. A large reception, suited staff, and an air of authority – a world I had not known then.

But time did what it always does. Slowly, things changed. The sons took charge—of the house and the business. His room was moved to the rear. After his wife passed, he stopped attending family gatherings. The narrative changed. Various versions of complaints surfaced from his children : he was difficult and interfering, gave too much to the daughters.

My husband and I decided to stop by the house, pretending to be in the area. The family received us with polite reluctance. When we asked to see uncle, they pointed to a door that led to a narrow store room. The room smelled of urine, medicines and something else. A man, once known for his dominance, had grown thin, his dignity lost in the cracks of the walls.

We stood still.

After a few minutes, we firmly requested that he be taken to the hospital. The family resisted but finally relented. As we prepared to leave, he whispered, with folded hands, “nandri”.

In the shifting dynamics between parents and adult children, something has begun to disappear - the old rhythm of care , presence and endurance. The list of grievances is long on either side. Ageing parents seem fixed in their ways, while children find the weight of criticism, dogmatism and unresolved hurts pulling them back amid demands of spouses and careers.

The tragedy lies in the realization that you cannot return to the path of yesteryears. The hands that once held yours become frail, unrecognisable.

In some cases, like that of uncle, estrangement turns into quiet cruelty—driven by inheritance feuds, ego and emotional fatigue.

That night, I thought of all our scriptures, parables, and proverbs. One message echo across cultures: Take care of your parents. “There is no temple holier than one’s mother; no scripture purer than the words of one’s father,” says an ancient Tamil saying. “Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long,” commands the Bible.

Interestingly, there is little in these scriptures about caring for one’s children. Why? Because it is natural to do so while it is not with parents. That is why cultures encode it into law, religion, and literature.

I could not recall any couplet by Valluvar that advised children to take care of their parents. He did talk about making the parents proud, but not about taking care of them.

But he has written something which is ever larger and more profound, about being grateful.

Ennandri Kondrarkkum Uyvundaam Uyvillai

SeiNandri Kondra Magarkku

One may slay all that is good and still find redemption.

But there is no salvation for the one who kills gratitude.

No lesson. Just a line that stays with you. Because, when gratitude dies, so does humanity.

Luckily, gratitude has not died altogether. The driver had it.

The court observed that the right to be heard at any stage of proceedings breathes life into the right to a fair trial.The court of special judge Vishal Gogne was hearing arguments on whether a notice is required to be issued to the accused in view of the proviso to BNSS Section 223. ""The right of the accused to be heard at the cognisance stage must be liberally applied to proceedings under PMLA before the special court as a continuation of the recent jurisprudence on PMLA, which has read the constitutional mandate and rights into PMLA,"" the judge said.The case is at the stage of consideration regarding notice. On April 25, additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for ED, submitted that under the new legal provisions cognisance of the chargesheet cannot be taken without first hearing the accused. On April 9, ED filed a chargesheet before the court that mentions Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as accused numbers 1 and 2 under Secs 3 and 4 (which deal with money-laundering and its punishment) and Sec 70 (offences by companies) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act . The charges, if proved, attract a maximum imprisonment of seven years.The chargesheet names seven accused - five individuals and two private companies - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, Sunil Bhandari, Young Indian, and Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd. On Friday, during the hearing, the ASG submitted before the court that in an ED case where notice was not issued, it was taken to the Supreme Court and SC had stayed the proceedings.The judge, taking note that the proviso to BNSS Sec 223 is a salutary provision in furtherance of the right to be heard as part of a fair trial, said, ""It is designed to protect accused persons against improper implication by permitting them to make submissions prior to the court taking cognisance of the offences in question. The BNSS is therefore a progressive legislation in this regard and records among its objectives and reasons a 'citizens-centric criminal procedure' as the 'need of the hour'.""This benevolent intent of BNSS should be read in favour of the accused rather than the investigation agencies when a right to be heard is to be accorded at any stage of the proceedings, the judge said. The court said it does not come to any ""detriment"" if the accused is permitted to make submissions on the question of cognisance. ""In this adherence to the principles of fair hearing, the right to be heard is not inconsistent with any of the powers vested in the ED for investigation or the presumptions as well as the burden of proof stipulated under the PMLA,"" said the court.The court also noted the submissions of the ASG that ED is not opposing such a notice precisely because it is a votary of a fair trial. The court listed various reasons for issuing notice, including that the proviso to BNSS Sec 223 creates a sui generis right of the accused to be heard at the cognisance stage and is not inconsistent with the complaint procedure or other provisions under PMLA.""Such a right does not defeat or diminish the operation of any provision of PMLA. The proviso to BNSS Sec 223... is required to be read in favour of the proposed accused persons,"" the court said.","Delhi court issues a notice to Congress functionaries Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and others in a money-laundering case related to the National Herald newspaper.

Sharp judge-lawyer exchange of words in Chhattisgarh booze case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-judge-lawyer-exchange-of-words-in-chhattisgarh-booze-case/articleshow/120834983.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday witnessed a sharp exchange of words between a bench headed by Justice Abhay S Oka and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani after the lawyer alleged that Chhattisgarh govt's plea against former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments. The bench passed an order asking him to move the CJI for transfer of the case to another bench and reminded him that the govt itself had sought deferment of hearing on a few occasions.At the outset of hearing, Jethmalani told the bench that the state wanted custodial interrogation and pressed for an early hearing. The court, however, said the main case was still pending and hearing on vacation of interim order could be heard with it as the accused had already been directed to cooperate with the probe. Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Meenakshi Arora also briefed the court that the accused were appearing on every date.Jethmalani thereafter questioned the court's jurisdiction in granting interim relief and said ""this is not the province of the court"". Not accepting his submission, the bench said the court was not ""powerless"" to grant relief. ""If you are making grievances against the bench, then you can go before the Chief Justice. This is not the way to behave,"" the bench said.Countering Jethmalani's submission that the accused had sought adjournments, Sankaranarayanan challenged him to spell out the dates when hearing was deferred due to the accused and told the bench that the state itself had taken adjournment three times in the case.Jethmalani clarified that he was not making any allegation against the bench. ""Your lordships are misunderstanding what I said. I did not say anything about the bench. I pointed out the conduct of the parties,"" he added.The court, however, went on to pass an order allowing the state to ask the CJI to transfer the case to another bench. ""If we start adopting this approach - which advocate has taken adjournment how many times - it will be impossible for us to function,"" the bench told Jethmalani.A bench headed by Justice Oka had on April 15 granted Tuteja bail in a money laundering case arising out of the Chhattisgarh liquor scam, noting that Tuteja had been in custody for over a year and charges had not been framed against him and more than 30 prosecution witnesses were to be examined in the case.Based on allegations of ED 's ""high handedness"" and ""inhuman conduct"" in interrogating a person for almost 15 hours which went beyond midnight, SC had in Jan pulled up the agency and expressed concern over its approach in conducting probe.ED denied the charge and accused Tuteja of influencing witnesses with the help of Chhattisgarh Police and the ex-advocate general under the previous Congress govt. It also produced documents in support of its charge in a sealed envelope, which is said to have led to the transfer of an important judicial officer outside the state.",Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani alleged that Chhattisgarh govt's plea against former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments.

SC urges law minister to make changes in arbitration bill yet to be taken up by Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-urges-law-minister-to-make-changes-in-arbitration-bill-yet-to-be-taken-up-by-parliament/articleshow/120834244.cms,"‘Even after 30 yrs, procedural issues dog arbitration regime’



NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, Supreme Court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in Parliament. On Friday, it ""urged"" the law ministry to take a ""serious look"" and make changes in it, keeping in mind the arbitration regime in India.Constitutional courts are empowered to test the validity of laws enacted by Parliament and state legislatures and interpret the law. The Constitution under Article 141 provides that a law declared valid by the SC shall be binding on all courts. But these courts have never entertained a petition challenging the validity of a bill.Though the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, proposing major changes in the 1996 law on the same subject, was not under challenge before SC, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan decided to scrutinise it. They concluded that the bill suffered procedural lacunae and vacuum similar to the 1996 Act.The bench’s comments came in a case involving arbitration between two parties.Giving a brief background of arbitration laws in India, starting with the 1940 Act, followed by the 1996 Act and the changes proposed to be effected through the 2024 bill, the bench said, “It has been almost 30 years since the 1996 Act has remained in force. Various amendments to the 1996 Act have been made over the years to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously. It is indeed very sad to note that even after these many years, procedural issues such as the one involved in the case at hand, have continued to plague the arbitration regime of India.”Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, “Unfortunately, even the new bill has taken no steps whatsoever for ameliorating the position of law as regards the power of impleadment or joinder of an arbitral tribunal. What is expressly missing in the 1996 Act is still missing in the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, despite a catena of decisions of this court as well as various high courts, highlighting the need for statutory recognition of such power in order to obviate all possibilities of confusion.”He further said, “We urge the department of legal affairs, ministry of law and justice, to take a serious look at the arbitration regime that is prevailing in India and bring about necessary changes while the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, is still being considered.”The same bench had raised eyebrows in political and legal circles with its verdict setting a deadline of three months for the President to give assent to bills sent to her by governors, and by suggesting that she might consider it prudent to take the opinion of the apex court to determine the validity of bills.","Supreme Court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in Parliament.

The sight of Kerala's Leftist CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at an event linked to an Adani project would ""give several people sleepless nights"", PM Modi quipped on Friday at the inauguration of Vizhinjam Port , India's first dedicated transshipment hub, in Thiruvananthapuram. He also took a dig at Kerala CPM's stance on private investment.Referring to state ports minister VN Vasavan calling Adani “a partner”, PM Modi said, “See, a communist minister called a private investor a partner. This reflects the change happening in India.” “I want to tell the chief minister (Vijayan)…you are a strong pillar of the INDI alliance. Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here…,” Modi said, pausing in between to allow his words to be translated to Malayalam for the local audience.When the translator appeared to misinterpret the part about “sleepless nights” as a reference to “issues about Indian airlines”, the PM immediately caught on. “He couldn’t translate it properly. But the message has reached where it should,” Modi said.AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said Modi’s remarks about INDIA bloc and Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi — the PM didn’t mention him — were unbecoming of his position. “Let’s see who actually has sleepless nights. It seems the PM got carried away by the excitement of meeting his dearest friend, Adani,” said Venugopal, adding that CM Vijayan could have corrected the PM, but chose not to.Later, Vasavan clarified that he called Adani a partner because the industrialist executed the Vizhinjam Port project initiated by ex-Congress CM Oommen Chandy. “There’s no need to read too much into what I said. It’s a public-private partnership , and as long as the agreement is in place, Adani remains the project partner,” he said.The launch event was overshadowed by friction between CPM and Congress. State leader of the opposition VD Satheesan skipped the event, claiming he wasn’t properly invited. Congress functionaries were also upset that the state govt didn’t acknowledge ex-CM Chandy’s role in the project. They also pointed out the irony of CM Vijayan accusing Chandy of corruption when he was CPM state secretary.","PM Modi said the sight of Kerala's Leftist CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at an event linked to an Adani project would ""give several people sleepless nights"" He also took a dig at Kerala CPM's stance on private investment.

""In a matter of one day, it has 8.9 lakh views, 8,500 likes, and 2,200 comments, and the video has gone viral.

Police response and current situation

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions following the murder of Hindutva activist Suhas Shetty, the Mangaluru Police have imposed a prohibitory order across the city from Friday until May 6. Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.On Thursday evening, around 8:30 pm, Suhas Shetty was traveling with five associates—Sanjay, Prajwal, Anvith, Latheesh, and Shashank—when their vehicle was intercepted near Kinnipadavu Cross by a group of assailants.The attackers, numbering around six, were traveling in a Swift car and a pickup truck. They ambushed Shetty and his group, assaulting him with deadly weapons, inflicting severe injuries.Despite being rushed to AJ Hospital, Shetty succumbed to his wounds. The police have since registered a murder case and are actively working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.Shetty was a well-known rowdy sheeter with five criminal cases—four in Mangaluru City and one in Dakshina Kannada district.Given Shetty's affiliations, his murder is considered a sensitive issue, prompting the police to launch a manhunt to locate the perpetrators.Notably, he was one of the accused in the 2022 murder of Mohammed Fazil, a 23-year-old resident of Mangalapete in Katipalla. Fazil's killing had already stirred significant tensions across the coastal region.In response to the incident, police issued the prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, enforced across the entire Mangaluru City Police jurisdiction.City police commissioner Anupam Agrawal, who also serves as the additional district magistrate, announced that public gatherings, meetings, processions, sloganeering, and the carrying of items that could be used as weapons are prohibited during this period. The measure aims to prevent any potential flare-ups and maintain public order in the aftermath of the murder.Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack on Shetty was premeditated, though the exact motive remains unclear. The police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Following the murder, Bajrang Dal had called for a city bandh late on Thursday night, and some miscreants attempted to pelt stones at buses. The police have since increased security in the area, ensuring adequate deployment and continuous patrols to monitor the situation. ""We have registered a murder case, and teams are working on it. It is too early to say what the motive was behind the murder. We have imposed prohibitory orders to ensure peace in the city,"" Commissioner Agrawal stated.","Suhas Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru have a potential playoff spot within reach, while Chennai Super Kings are in search of a morale-boosting win. But beyond the immediate team objectives, Saturday’s IPL clash promises a nostalgic spectacle — a possible final face-off between two legends of the game, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, in the league.Before dwelling on that emotional subplot, it’s worth noting the stakes. A win for RCB would take their tally to 16 points, putting them in a strong position to secure a place in the Qualifiers with three matches still to go.For CSK, already out of playoff contention, a win could provide a late spark — a chance to build some momentum and finish mid-table, steering clear of the embarrassment of ending up at the bottom of the standings.The pitch at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium has offered some help to bowlers this season, making run-scoring a tougher task for batters, who’ve had to work hard for their runs. However, there have been instances where the surface has favoured batters, allowing them to play with freedom and capitalise on the short boundaries for maximum returns. If the pitch leans towards batting-friendly conditions, bowlers will need to stick to a stump-to-stump line and use variations wisely to outsmart the batters and take wickets.On the other hand, any assistance from the surface will allow them to bowl more aggressively and apply pressure to restrict the opposition. Dew is likely to play a crucial role, especially in the second innings — a trend that has significantly affected bowling teams throughout the season. The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, home to RCB, has hosted 99 IPL matches so far. Of these, teams batting first have won 42 games, while those chasing have won 53. The highest successful run chase at this venue is 186/3, achieved by the Deccan Chargers against RCB in 2010.RCB: Virat Kohli, Jacob Bethell, Rajat Patidar (C), Jitesh Sharma (WK), Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Suyash Sharma, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalCSK: Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, MS Dhoni (C/WK), Noor Ahmad, Syed Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha PathiranaRajat Patidar (c) Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Jitesh Sharma (w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Lungi Ngidi, Liam Livingstone, Swapnil Singh, Manoj Bhandage, Rasikh Dar Salam, Nuwan Thushara, Jacob Bethell, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara, Abhinandan Singh.MS Dhoni (c, wk), Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Anshul Kamboj, R Ashwin, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Jamie Overton, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Shreyas Gopal, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi.Matches played: 34RCB won: 12CSK won: 21NR: 1Tied: 0Out of the 34 matches played between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, CSK have emerged victorious 21 times, while RCB have won 12 matches.

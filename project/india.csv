As Iran Burns, India Flags Risk To 9,000 Indians, MEA Sets Record Straight On Chabahar Port Exit

NEW DELHI: Several Indian nationals, returned from Iran, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi late on Friday amid escalating regional tensions.Their return follows an advisory issued by the Indian government urging citizens in Iran to leave the country due to the deteriorating security situation. The Ministry of External Affairs said it is closely monitoring developments and remains “committed to doing whatever is necessary for their well-being. ”One Indian national who returned from Iran described it as ""bad situation"" and expressed gratitude to the government for facilitating their departure. “The conditions are bad there. The Government of India is cooperating a lot, and the Embassy provided us with information on leaving Iran as early as possible...'Modi ji hai toh har cheez mumkin hai',” he said.Another returnee told ANI that conditions had worsened sharply in recent weeks. “We were there for a month. But we were only facing problems for the last one or two weeks...When we went outside, the protesters would come in front of the car. They would cause a little trouble...The internet was shut down, which is why we couldn't tell our families anything, so we were a little worried...Wecouldn't even contact the embassy,” he said.A third Indian national, a resident of Jammu and Kashmir, highlighted the risks posed by the unrest. “I am a resident of Jammu and Kashmir... The protests there were dangerous. The Indian government has made a very good effort and brought the students back...” he said.Family members of those returning gathered at the airport to welcome them home. Among them was a family awaiting the arrival of an aunt who had travelled to Iran on pilgrimage. “My wife's aunt went to Iran on a pilgrimage...Iran has always been a good friend of India and we were very confident in the Modi government, which continuously supported...We thank the government of India for making this possible. We are very happy as our family member is returning to India,” a relative said.Another man waiting for his sister-in-law thanked the authorities for coordinating the evacuation. “My sister-in-law is returning from Iran today. There was a war-like situation in Iran, and the internet was down. We were not able to contact her by any means. We were worried...We are very happy that she is returning to India safely...We thank the Government of India for making arrangements for their return to India during these difficult times,” he said.A family member of two returnees said communication had been cut off for days. “My mother and aunt are returning from Iran. We were worried because we were unable to contact her for three days...They are returning to India today,” he said.Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Tehran issued an advisory asking Indian nationals, including students, businesspeople, pilgrims and tourists, to leave Iran using available transport options, including commercial flights, citing the “evolving situation.”Separately, the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi strongly advised Indians to avoid travel to Iran until further notice. It reiterated a January 5 advisory urging those already in the country to remain cautious and avoid protests or demonstrations.The unrest began at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on December 28 over the sharp fall in the Iranian rial and later spread nationwide. The currency’s decline followed multiple crises, including severe water shortages, power outages, rising unemployment and surging inflation.","Several Indian nationals, returned from Iran, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi late on Friday.

"Can't use law to scuttle Parliamentary process, says SC, rejects Justice Varma's plea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-use-law-to-scuttle-parliamentary-process-says-sc-rejects-varmas-plea/articleshow/126593022.cms,"NEW DELHI: Holding that the Judges (Inquiry) Act cannot be interpreted in a manner that frustrates its objective, and constitutional safeguards for judges cannot come at the cost of paralysing the removal process itself, Supreme Court rejected Allahabad high court judge Yashwant Varma's plea against the Lok Sabha Speaker's decision to appoint a committee on the motion to remove him. It said the Speaker has committed no illegality.Though SC held that the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman was competent to refuse admission of notice of motion, it, however, said the manner in which the notice of motion was processed at the secretariat level does not fully align with the role contemplated under the law.The bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma refrained from examining the validity of the deputy chairman’s order as it was not challenged by Justice Varma, but said it would have no effect.On July 25 last year, a notice on the motion to remove Justice Varma from his position was signed by over 100 LS members and it was received by the Speaker around 12.30pm, but was not admitted on the same day. After a brief interval, between 4.07pm and 4.19pm, a notice signed by more than 50 members was given in RS.Referring to the first proviso to Section 3(2) of the Act, which contemplates a situation in which notices are given in both Houses on the same day, the RS chairman directed that “the secretary general will take necessary steps in this direction”, but on the same day the chairman resigned from his office of vice-president of India.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Justice Varma, submitted that when notices of motion are given on the same day before both Houses, judicial inquiry committee (JIC) could not have been constituted unless both Houses had admitted the motions. JIC has to be constituted jointly by the Speaker & the chairman, he said. Countering his contention, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Section 3(2) is attracted only where the motions are “admitted” in both Houses, and not just being “given”.Rejecting Varma’s plea, the bench said the provision does not contemplate a scenario where a notice of motion is accepted in one House and rejected in the other. “To interpret the said proviso in the manner suggested by Rohatgi would require us to read into it a disabling consequence, namely, that the motion pending in the other House must also necessarily fail. Such an interpretation would amount to judicial legislation, a course we are neither empowered nor inclined to undertake,” it said.“There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law. The argument, therefore, lacks any legal foundation. The interpretation advanced by the petitioner of rejection of a notice in one House resulting in the notice automatically failing in the other House would entail consequences of a most serious nature,” the bench said. “The members would be put to square one and the process has to be initiated afresh in either House. Had Parliament intended such far-reaching consequences, it would have articulated the first proviso in clear and unambiguous terms. The absence of any express provision to that effect is, in our opinion, determinative,” it said.The bench said accepting such an argument would produce absurd results where the individual capacity of one House in initiating a motion under Article 124(4) becomes contingent upon the outcome in the other House, even at the stage of admission of such a motion. It said taking away the autonomy of one of the two Houses of Parliament could not have been the intent behind the first proviso.“The proviso applies to only one specific situation, namely, where notices of motion given on the same day have been admitted by both Houses. It does not restrict or negate the individual authority of either House of Parliament,” it said.“The first proviso must, therefore, be construed to balance prescribed protection with the effective functioning of the mechanism for removal of a judge from office triggered by the peoples’ representatives, and not to frustrate it altogether,” it said.",Supreme Court rejects Allahabad high court judge Yashwant Varma's plea against the Lok Sabha Speaker's decision to appoint a committee on the motion to remove him.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

Thackerays lose control of BMC: What's next for Uddhav and his Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thackerays-lose-control-of-bmc-whats-next-for-uddhav-and-his-sena/articleshow/126584774.cms,"Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check

NEW DELHI: The last bastion of the Thackerays has been breached. The BJP-led Mahayuti has ended the decades-old dominance of the Thackerays in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Even the “Brhamastra” of reunion, of cousins Uddhav and Raj. failed to help them retain control of the cash-rich civic body.For Uddhav Thackeray , this was a do-or-die electoral battle. After losing his government, his party, his symbol, it was important for Uddhav not to lose control over the BMC. While Uddhav’s Shiv Sena UBT did put up a strong fight, in the end it was not enough. On the other hand, Raj Thackeray ’s MNS, which has failed to make any significant electoral impact in the state since it was formed, failed yet again. As the results show, there were few takers for Raj Thackeray’s extreme anti-Marathi aggression.So, where do the Thackerays go from here? Will the Thackeray cousins continue with their alliance for future elections in the state? Or will Uddhav chart his own path once again?After the assembly elections in 2019, Uddhav had parted ways with his long-time ally - the BJP and joined hands with Sharad Pawar’s NCP and the Congress to form the MVA government in the state. However, his government could last only for around two and a half years. A revolt in the party by Eknath Shinde saw Uddhav lose his government, party and even the bow and arrow symbol.Uddhav’s decision to join hands with the Congress was a bold political decision given his father Bal Thackeray’s very strong views against the grand-old party. The BJP and the Shinde Sena have used Uddhav’s Congress association to not just corner him but also question his Hindutva commitment.Ahead of the BMC elections , Uddhav once again changed tracks - this time choosing his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray over the Congress for the make or break civic polls. The much-hyped reunion of the cousins became the talking point during the civic elections. Together they raised the Marathi Manoos pitch with aggression. However, in the end it was not enough to secure them a victory.What is also a worry for Uddhav Thackeray is the encouraging performance of Shinde’s Shiv Sena. Eknath Shinde has made impressive gains since he broke ranks with Uddhav. He has proved, election after election, that his Shiv Sena has wider acceptance in Maharashtra compared to the Uddhav Sena. With the BJP firmly behind him as of now, Shinde is the biggest threat to Uddhav’s party and his future politics.Uddhav Thackeray has not only lost electoral battles but also the perception battle of being the real Shiv Sena. He desperately needs to reclaim the political space in Maharashtra which he has lost to Shinde Sena in the last few years.While Uddhav’s party had made it clear that it will return to MVA fold for the assembly elections, it will be interesting to see the future course of action that Uddhav and his MVA allies actually take.The Congress has made it clear that it will not be part of any coalition that has Raj Thackeray, given the hard anti-outsider stand of the MNS chief. The Congress, which contested the civic polls without its MVA allies, would be hopeful, if not happy, with the results.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, projected to win more than 1,800 seats statewide. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 90 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 90 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.Statewide results reinforced this dominance. The BJP led in Pune Municipal Corporation with over 50 of 162 seats, secured a majority in Navi Mumbai (40 of 67), and crossed 80 seats in Nagpur’s 151-member civic body.Axis My India had estimated the BJP support among first-time voters (18–25 age group) at 47 per cent, while 44 per cent of women voters backed the party, influenced by welfare schemes such as Majhi Ladki Bahin and promises of tighter audits of civic spending.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party has won/leading on 352 wards and has emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won or is leadinf in over 1,700 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.The party registered victory/is leading on 94 wards, primarily in Muslim-majority pockets such as Bhendi Bazaar and parts of Kurla and Mumbra. In Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, it crossed 15 seats.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 72 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress was reduced to around 21 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 306 wards out of 2,869.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 11 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 18 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 28 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra civic elections 2026, including the high-stakes Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP-led Mahayuti. Across 27 civic bodies and 2,869 wards, results show the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance decisively ahead, as the party and its partners captured key urban strongholds.Meanwhile, smaller players made targeted gains and traditionally dominant regional parties struggled to counter a robust campaign narrative focused on governance.The most striking outcome of the civic polls is the BJP ’s dominance, under the strategic leadership of Devendra Fadnavis. In the BMC, India’s richest municipal corporation, the BJP is on track to secure around 90 wards, compared with just 82 in 2017.When combined with alliance partners, the Mahayuti tally comfortably surpasses the 114 seats needed for a majority, currently projected at 140+ BMC wards. The BJP also leads major urban bodies:The outcome validates the ""triple engine"" narrative the BJP has pushed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Analysts attribute the BJP-led Mahayuti’s march past the 100-seat mark to one overriding factor: a deeply fragmented opposition that converted the contest into a patchwork of “friendly fights” and multi-cornered battles. The sharpest splits emerged in the traditional Marathi heartland. Although the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS stitched together a tactical understanding, they faced competition not only from the BJP but also from the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena . In more than 80 wards, the two Sena factions were locked in direct contests, effectively dividing the same “bow and arrow” legacy vote.The Congress ’s decision to stay out of the Sena (UBT)–MNS arrangement compounded the problem. By contesting independently in an attempt to consolidate minority and Dalit voters, the party instead triggered a three-way split in what observers described as the secular vote. In several areas, Congress candidates, along with those from the VBA and the Samajwadi Party, played a spoiler role that hurt Sena (UBT) more than the Mahayuti.This splintering meant that anti-Mahayuti sentiment never coalesced into a decisive bloc. Reports pointed to at least 15 instances of “friendly fights” where opposition or anti-BJP parties fielded candidates against one another. The internal rivalries not only confused voters but also drained organisational energy and resources, leaving the Opposition poorly positioned to mount a unified challenge to the BJP.The results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics. The BJP, which for decades played second fiddle during the undivided Shiv Sena’s long reign over the BMC, has now emerged as the dominant force, aided by the Eknath Shinde-led Sena faction that broke away in 2022.The undivided Shiv Sena had controlled the 227-member BMC almost continuously since the late 1990s, making the civic body the cornerstone of its political and organisational power. For the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), the latest outcome marks its weakest showing in the corporation in more than 20 years, signalling a sharp erosion of its once-formidable urban base.Trends suggest that while the broader “Thackeray brand” retained limited resonance with voters, it was not enough to arrest the party’s decline. The results have also cast a spotlight on the future of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with questions mounting over Raj Thackeray’s political viability as his appeal failed to translate into significant electoral gains.Historically, the Shiv Sena, founded by Bal Thackeray, first captured the BMC in 1997, winning 103 seats and unseating the Congress, which secured 49. The BJP then won 26 seats, while the Samajwadi Party emerged victorious in 21 wards. In the 2017 polls, the undivided Sena had remained the single largest party with 84 seats, narrowly ahead of the BJP’s 82, while Congress won 31, the NCP nine, the MNS seven and the Samajwadi Party six. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena were allies, they had contested separately and stitched together an alliance after the results.In contrast, the current elections saw the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS contest together in an effort to consolidate the Marathi vote amid a fractured Sena legacy. That strategy failed to hold Uddhav Thackeray’s traditional civic bastion.Political observers say the verdict reflects a fundamental shift in Mumbai’s civic power structure, with influence moving away from the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena and the BJP significantly expanding its footprint in the country’s financial capital.Ajit Pawar’s bid to revive the Nationalist Congress Party’s urban strongholds through a late “family reunion” with the Nationalist Congress Party (SP) fell flat in the 2026 civic polls, as the Bharatiya Janata Party swept Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.Seeking to blunt the BJP’s challenge in his traditional bastions, Ajit Pawar forged an alliance with his uncle Sharad Pawar’s faction and ran an unusually confrontational campaign against his own state-level ally. He accused the BJP’s local leadership of stalled development and corruption, and personally targeted Union minister and Pune MP Murlidhar Mohol, as well as Pimpri-Chinchwad MLA Mahesh Landge.The strategy did not work. Live trends showed the BJP leading decisively in both cities: over 110 seats in Pune, compared with the NCP’s 12 and NCP (SP)’s two, and 84 seats in Pimpri-Chinchwad against the NCP’s 37. The outcome significantly weakens Ajit Pawar’s bargaining power within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance.Compounding the setback, Sharad Pawar remained largely absent from the campaign, as did Baramati MP Supriya Sule, blunting the optics of reconciliation. Ajit Pawar’s manifesto promises, including free Metro and bus rides and property tax relief for small homes, were ridiculed by BJP leaders as unrealistic.The polls, held after an eight-year gap, were also fought amid scrutiny of the Mundhwa land deal involving Ajit Pawar’s son, Parth Pawar. Together, the results underscore the limits of factional reunions without organisational unity or voter trust.One of the notable surprises of the 2026 civic results was the performance of the All India Majlis‑e‑Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).AIMIM has won or is leading in over 90 seats, performing better that regional parties like Raj Thackeray's MNS and Sharad Pawar's NCP.While AIMIM’s overall tally remains modest compared to the Mahayuti or traditional Congress vote banks, the party’s strategic gains have reshaped local arithmetic in several wards. In tightly contested seats, their presence appears to have split opposition votes, inadvertently aiding Mahayuti victories.For the Indian National Congress, the civic polls were mostly disappointing, but not uniformly so.The party decided to enter the contest solo after the Thackeray cousins reunited. While it was at No. 4 in BMC with 23 seats, the party managed to get third spot overall in the state with over 300 votes.The party's performed better in the state compared to its Maha Vikas Agadi allies Shiv Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP).While it might not be enough, this little resurgence might provide the motivation the party needs for the upcoming state elections.","The Maharashtra civic elections 2026 delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP- led Mahayuti. Results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics. The outcome validates the ""triple engine"" narrative the BJP has pushed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126580492,imgsize-1447732,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

""Meanwhile, Annamalai himself congratulated the Mahayuti government for clean sweep in Maharashtra civic polls.""The people of Mumbai have spoken with crystal clarity! The historic victory of the Mahayuti alliance in the BMC elections is a resounding endorsement of development-first governance.From the grassroots of local bodies to the halls of the parliament, this is the Triple Engine that delivers real, tangible development for every citizen. While the opposition trafficked in divisive narratives aimed at fragmenting the people, Mumbai chose unity, progress, and inclusive growth,"" the BJP leader wrote on X.Taking veiled jibe at Raj Thackeray, Annamalai wrote: ""The opposition was banking on the failed strategy of dividing Mumbaikars along linguistic and regional lines, a 20th-century relic the people soundly rejected. While our NDA government talks about development infrastructure, jobs, and growth, the opposition clung to an archaic narrative of regional animosity. Mumbaikars chose substance over divisiveness.

Try cutting my legs,” he said, insisting his comments had been misrepresented.Clarifying his position, Annamalai said praising leaders like K Kamaraj did not diminish their Tamil identity, just as calling Mumbai a world-class city did not erase the role of Maharashtrians in building it. He stressed that Mumbai’s growth was inseparable from the contributions of the Marathi people.Annamalai also accused Shiv Sena leaders of insulting Tamils by mocking their traditional attire, such as lungis and veshtis, and said it was surprising that the DMK chose to share political space with parties that resorted to such remarks.Interestingly, before 'rasmalai' it was 'jalebi' that was served as a sweet revenge by the BJP.In 2024, as the BJP swept Haryana assembly elections, its Haryana unit marked its dramatic comeback and a historic third consecutive assembly win with a pointed gesture: sending a kilogram of jalebis to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Delhi office.","PC Mohan, Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore Central, shared photos of 'rasmalai' (Indian sweet dish) on X and wrote: ""Ordered some rasmalai. #BMCResults"" The tweet was a direct jibe at Raj Thakeray, who started a war of words with BJP MP K Annamalai earlier last week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126569536,imgsize-1180209,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass- shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law and destabilise urban ecosystems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556091,imgsize-1095608,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday credited the BJP-led Mahayuti’s sweeping performance in the state’s municipal elections to its development agenda saying Hindutva and development were inseparable for the party.He said, ""Hindutva has always been our soul; one cannot differentiate our Hindutva from development""“First of all, I want to thank the citizens of Maharashtra for giving a grand victory to the BJP in the municipal elections. BJP and Mahayuti are going to form their 25 mayors after these elections,” Fadnavis said while addressing supporters after the results.He said the alliance had contested the civic polls with a clear focus on governance and infrastructure. “We faced these elections with a vision of development under the leadership of PM Modi... That is why we got a record-breaking mandate in these elections... These results have clarified that Maharashtra relies a lot on PM Modi,” he added.As per trends till Friday evening, the BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti was leading in a majority of municipal corporations across the state, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.The saffron alliance was ahead on 130 of the 227 BMC seats, comfortably crossing the majority mark of 114. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 93 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena was leading on 27.Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar said the BMC verdict reflected Mumbai’s endorsement of the alliance’s development agenda. “First of all, I want to thank the people of Mumbai and express my gratitude for reposing faith in the BJP alliance... This mandate has been given for the development of Mumbai. We have won the trust of Mumbai's people by dedicating to them important projects like the Metro Rail Network, Coastal Road, and Trans Harbour Link, and this mandate shows the desire of Mumbai's people for the city's development,” he said.The BMC elections were held after a gap of eight years, with the previous polls conducted in 2017. Mumbai is set to get a new mayor after nearly four years, as the term of the last elected mayor, Kishori Pednekar, ended in March 2022.Elsewhere in the state, the BJP also posted strong leads in other key civic bodies. In Pune Municipal Corporation, the BJP was leading on 90 of the 165 seats, while the NCP was at 20. The Congress-Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance was leading in 10 seats, while the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena stood at two.The Mahayuti also crossed majority marks in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik, Jalna and Vasai-Virar, according to trends.Congratulating party leaders, CM Fadnavis called up state BJP chief Ravindra Chavan and Mumbai BJP president Ameet Satam as the alliance surged ahead in the civic polls. Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane hailed the results, saying the Mahayuti was set to occupy mayoral posts across most municipal corporations.“It seems that everything is being prepared for people with the 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'I Love Mahadev' mindset, and those belonging to the Mahayuti alliance, to occupy most of the mayor's seats,” Rane said in a social media video.Polling for 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra was held on Thursday, with counting taking place on Friday.","BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti was leading in a majority of municipal corporations across the state, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.This notification comes barely a month before the scheduled rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), or barrierless tolling, on around half a dozen stretches of the NH network.The notification was issued early this week. Work of MLFF is at an advanced stage at Manoharpur and Shahjahanpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, at Chorasi on the Surat-Vadodara stretch of NH-48 and at Gharonda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway. The changes in Central Motor Vehicles Rules are expected to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one skips paying toll when barrierless tolling is implemented.On MLFF stretches, there will be no physical barrier to stop vehicles for the collection of user fee. As per the notification, any “unpaid user fee” will be linked with the NOCs for vehicle related services and transactions. It defines unpaid user fee as the user fee payable by a vehicle for use of a section of NH, where the electronic toll collection system has recorded the passage of such vehicle but has not received the applicable user fee levied.Officials said that soon there will be a portal where people will be able to raise their complaints for settling disputes. “There will be enough scope for settlement before initiating action of blocking the NOC,” an official said.The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.

NCP merger in limbo?

NEW DELHI: The coming together of Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar faltered on Friday as united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections.According to the latest trends, BJP has taken the lead of 74 wards in the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations -- considered as one of the richest after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Meanwhile, NCP(Ajit Pawar) is ahead of 40 seats, while the NCP(Sharad Pawar) is leading in one ward.This comes despite NCP's aggressive campaigning in the city during the run up to the elections.Meanwhile, BJP is leading in 52 wards in Pune. NCP, on the other hand, is leading in only two wards. The Congress which is ahead in five wards, is allying with the Thackeray brothers (Uddhav's Shiv Sena and Raj's MNS) - who are not leading in any wards.Both factions of NCP came together for the local body polls in Maharashtra. This came two years after, Ajit along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar's faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit's faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock' symbol. Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar's faction (NCP-SP) adopted the ‘tutari' (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.During the elections campaign, speculations were rife that both the factions of NCP were heading towards a merger. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule hinted at a reunion in the future.While speaking to news agency IANS, Sule had said that a decision about the merger could be taken in the future.“Our alliance is formed for the Pune Municipal Corporation elections. We will see about it in the future,” Sule said.However, after the lackluster performance in the local body polls, it would be interesting to see if both the factions would still see merit in coming together.","NCP suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections.

Car mileage claims to get real as govt pushes AC-on testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-mileage-claims-to-get-real-as-govt-pushes-ac-on-testing/articleshow/126586190.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at providing more realistic and accurate mileage figures for cars, the road transport ministry has proposed mandatory testing of fuel efficiency with the air-conditioning (AC) system both switched on and off. The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), manufactured or imported in India from October 1.Officials said subsequently, it will be mandatory for car manufacturers and importers to put the mileage for with and without AC on in the user manual of vehicles and on their website as well. So far car manufacturers have argued that as per European norms, only mileage without AC is taken into account. This is expected to improve transparency and help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions.The draft notification issued on Thursday said, “On and after October 1, 2026, all vehicles of category M1 (cars), manufactured or imported in India, shall be tested for measurement of fuel consumption with air-conditioning system in operation, as per AIS-213, as amended from time to time.” Officials said the move is intended to reflect real-world driving conditions, where AC usage significantly impacts mileage and energy consumption.At present, car manufacturers in India declare fuel-efficiency figures based on testing conducted without the AC running. Automakers have maintained that this practice aligns with prevailing European norms. However, govt officials noted that such figures often do not reflect actual on-road performance, leading to a gap between claimed and experienced mileage.AIS-213 lays down detailed procedures for measuring vehicle emissions and fuel consumption while the AC system is operational. The standard is designed to capture the additional fuel use and emissions generated due to AC load, which can substantially affect real-world efficiency and pollution levels.TOI has learnt that the ministry is also working on a broader framework to increase consumer awareness about vehicle emissions and in the near future, car owners may get exact information on this.","The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) It will be mandatory for car manufacturers and importers to put the mileage for with and without AC on in the user manual of vehicles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126586439,imgsize-726145,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

It proposes that all these new buses with length 9-metre and above shall have floor height of 400 mm.The ministry has issued the draft notification considering that the manufacturers are already producing such buses. “The ecosystem is in place for implementing this norm,” said an official.High steps, narrow aisles, poor handholds, and cramped seating make boarding difficult, especially for elderly, women, children, and persons with disabilities in most of the city buses operating across the country. Though low-floor buses exist, many cities still operate high-floor or semi-low-floor buses due to lower upfront costs.Officials said the compliance of Automotive Industry Standard (AIS-216), which provides a standardised set of rules for how bus bodies should be designed and tested so that they comply with legal safety and performance expectations, will make city buses safer.","All new buses with length 9-metre and above shall have floor height of 400 mm.

Actin ‘waves’ help T cells reuse key receptors: IISc study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actin-waves-help-t-cells-reuse-key-receptors-iisc-study/articleshow/126581874.cms,"BENGALURU: A new study from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has uncovered how dynamic movements of actin, a structural protein inside cells, help T cells sustain immune responses by preserving critical surface receptors during early contact with infected cells.T cells are central to adaptive immunity, the arm of the immune system that recognises and eliminates specific pathogens. As per the study, when a naive T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC), it forms a specialised contact zone called the immunological synapse. Events in the first few minutes of this interaction determine how the T cell will respond.Previous studies had shown that antigen-bound T cell receptors (TCRs) cluster at the synapse and move towards its centre, driven by the backward flow of actin filaments. This inward movement was thought to prepare the receptors for endocytosis, allowing the T cell to disengage from the APC.However, this posed a puzzle: T cells are known to interact with multiple APCs in succession, something that would be difficult if most receptors were internalised and had to be newly produced each time.To investigate this, a team led by Sudha Kumari from the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, working with Sumantra Sarkar’s group from the Department of Physics, used high spatial and temporal resolution imaging to track TCR movement during contact with an APC-like surface.They also developed a tracking algorithm to analyse the trajectories of individual receptor clusters.The results, published in the journal “EMBO Reports”, showed that nearly 40% of TCR microclusters moved away from the centre of the immunological synapse towards the cell periphery, a behaviour that could not be explained by actin’s conventional inward flow alone.The researchers found that actin was forming outward-propagating wavefronts around the synapse centre. These waves were tightly coupled to the outward motion of TCR microclusters, effectively rescuing them from endocytosis.Experiments with naive T cells lacking the protein WASP, which is associated with immunodeficiency disorders, showed a breakdown in this coupling, underlining the role of actin dynamics in the process, IISc said.“It’s like saying the river flows both ways,” Kumari said, referring to the paradoxical observation of actin-driven transport in opposing directions.The findings highlight a previously underappreciated layer of control at the immune synapse. According to first author Aheria Dey, a PhD student at IISc, this contact site is the T cell’s “decision-making point”, and small changes in cytoskeletal behaviour could influence whether immune responses are effective or faulty.The work also raises broader questions in biophysics about how active cellular materials generate complex patterns, with potential implications for understanding immune disorders, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune diseases.","A new study from the Indian Institute of Science has uncovered how dynamic movements of actin, a structural protein inside cells, help T cells sustain immune responses.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday inaugurated the 3rd International Kite Festival, urging the Delhi government and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to form a committee to make the city the national hub for kite festivities, expand the event, and encourage public participation for a grand nationwide celebration.Addressing the 3rd International Kite Festival- 2026 in Delhi, Shah said, ""The kite festival will connect people across the entire country, and in the future, it can become a national festival. I urge the Delhi administration and the DDA to form a committee to make Delhi the centre of the kite festival for the whole country, and to work to expand it and ensure public participation to make it a truly grand celebration.""Shah also referenced the richness of India's festival culture, quoting poet Kalidasa, ""Utsav-priya janah,"" meaning the people of India are fond of festivals. He said that throughout the year, people across the country celebrate festivals, which bring society together and foster a collective vision, adding that Uttarayan is an integral part of this tradition.He recalled the role of kites in India's freedom movement, saying the Simon Commission faced strong opposition across the country, with the slogan ""Simon Go Back"" becoming a key symbol of resistance.""The most powerful protest happened during Uttarayan, when people all over the country flew kites with 'Simon Go Back' written on them, filling the sky and demonstrating their strength to the British,"" Shah said.Speaking about Somnath Swabhiman Parv to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first attack on the Somnath temple , Amit Shah said that those who destroyed Somnath are gone, but the temple stands proud.""PM Modi has created the Somnath Swabhiman Parv to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first attack on the Somnath temple. Now, the Indian government and several state governments have also decided to observe a Somnath Swabhiman Varsh.""He highlighted the resilience of the temple, stating,""The power of those who build is far greater than that of those who destroy. Those who destroyed it Mahmud of Ghazni, Mahmud Begada, Alauddin Khilji are nowhere to be seen on the world map today. The Somnath temple stands proudly in the same place, visible to the entire world. This is a symbol of the eternal nature and immortality of Sanatana Dharma, and that the fundamental elements of Indian culture are immortal,"" Shah said.",Amit Shah inaugurated the 3rd International Kite Festival- 2026 in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Friday approved a comprehensive roadmap to curb air pollution in the capital and clean the Yamuna, including installation of misting systems at 62 pollution hotspots and strengthening sewage and industrial waste treatment, as part of the city's pollution control plan up to 2028.Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters that the government has finalised short-term, mid-term and long-term measures with fixed timelines to tackle dust pollution, transport emissions, waste management, and river pollution.Special misting systems will be installed at 62 identified pollution hotspots, besides major traffic corridors and PWD roads, to control PM2.5 pollution, Sirsa said.He further said mechanical sweeping would be expanded to cover road stretches across Delhi, while the dust mitigation plans of multiple agencies, including the Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the Cantonment Board have been reviewed and approved.""The issue of garbage mountains was reviewed, and a detailed plan has been finalised to ensure that all fresh municipal waste is processed through waste-to-energy projects by 2026-27,"" the minister said.He said discussions were also held on the Phase 5 expansion of the Delhi Metro network, requirement of thousands of buses by 2028, and construction of large bus terminals.""Measures to strengthen last-mile connectivity include increasing the number of e-autos, creating EV infrastructure, launching mobile applications for transport access, and developing adequate parking facilities at metro stations,"" Sirsa added.To improve the cleanliness of the Yamuna, the Delhi government has decided to set up additional biogas plants, and ensure industries install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and sewage treatment plants (STPs) to prevent the discharge of untreated waste, he said.Sirsa said the chief minister had fixed clear timelines for action up to December 2026, December 2027 and December 2028.He also announced enhanced financial support to the MCD, under which the number of material recovery facilities (MRFs) will be increased from 70 to 250 across the city.He said discussions would also be held with the Centre and adjoining states, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, to jointly improve Delhi-NCR air quality.During the press conference, Sirsa also commented on the Sikh Guru-related row, alleging that Leader of Opposition Atishi had avoided facing the House and the public following her contentious remarks in the Assembly.""The Punjab Police has sought time for the third time. The same police which registered a case within hours are now unable to explain the basis of that case even after 10 days,"" he said, alleging ""dishonest intent"" and evasion of accountability.The ruling BJP has accused Atishi of using ""insensitive words"" during a discussion in the Delhi Assembly on January 6 to mark 350 years of the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, Bhai Sati Das, Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Dayala, demanding an apology.","The Delhi government has approved a comprehensive roadmap to curb air pollution in the capital.

NEW DELHI: Questioning the legal shield granted to serving and former chief election commissioners (CEC) and election commissioners under a new law, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa on Friday described the provision as an “extraordinary protection. ”“I am not aware of any comparable protection available to other public institutions or public servants. In a democracy, accountability is paramount, and therefore this kind of legal shield, in my view, should not exist. Even if a right decision has been taken, it must still stand the test of being defended before a court of law,” Lavasa said on the sidelines of a panel discussion on accountability for the Election Commission (EC).The Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners under the CEC and EC Appointment Act, 2023.The petition contends that the provision confers “unprecedented, unbridled power” on the CEC and election commissioners by granting them permanent, blanket immunity from both civil and criminal proceedings, even in cases of alleged misuse of office.Clause 16 of the law states that no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, deed or statement committed, done or spoken while acting, or purporting to act, in the discharge of official duties or functions.Lavasa, who was appointed as one of two election commissioners in January 2018, resigned in August 2020 to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB). He drew national attention in 2019 after recording a dissenting opinion in a panel decision on complaints against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then BJP president Amit Shah during the Lok Sabha election campaign.","The Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners under the CEC and EC Appointment Act, 2023.

But Harish has been in a state of complete inertness. His eyes do not move, nor respond to danger.Advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, appearing for Harish, submitted that he has been in an irreversible and incurable state with 100% disability since the accident, with no hope of recovery.The court should proceed to make a final decision on withdrawing his life support system, she said.The court reserved its order after hearing both the sides. This is the first case of its kind when the apex court will decide a plea for passive euthanasia since it legalised the same.Shanbaug, a nurse who spent 42 years in a persistent vegetative state after being raped, died in 2015. She was left with severe brain damage and paralysed after the 1973 attack by a ward attendant in the Mumbai hospital where she worked.A plea was filed by a writer in SC seeking removal of her life support system, but the hospital staff, who were taking care of her, strongly opposed the plea and the court did not allow it. Passive euthanasia had not been legalised in the country at that time, happening only after the apex court’s verdict in 2018.Bhati had told the bench earlier that she had had a talk with the team of doctors, i.e., members of the Primary Board as well as Secondary Board, who examined Harish, and they were of the opinion that continuation of medical treatment was not in his best interest and that, in the given circumstances, nature should be allowed to take its course. ""The doctors are also of the opinion that Harish would remain in this permanent vegetative state (PVS) for years to come, with tubes inserted all over his body. However, he would never be able to recover and live a normal life,"" she told the bench.As per the procedure framed by SC on passive euthanasia, the decision to withdraw the artificial life support system can be taken only after the primary and secondary medical boards concur on the issue. In this case, both the boards are one on withdrawing Harish’s life support system, and the final call now has to be taken by the apex court.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor of his paying guest accommodation on Aug 20, 2013, while he was pursuing a B.Tech degree at Punjab University. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.","Harish Rana has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years.

Capital chokes: GRAP-III reimposed in Delhi-NCR; air quality likely to turn 'severe',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/capital-chokes-grap-iii-reimposed-in-delhi-ncr-air-quality-likely-to-turn-severe/articleshow/126568498.cms,"(PTI)

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday enforced GRAP-III (Graded Response Action Plan) in Delhi-NCR as air quality is expected to slip into the ‘severe’ category in the coming days.Delhi-NCR has been grappling with high pollution levels for several months. In December, all measures under GRAP Stage III were implemented after the Air Quality Index (AQI) rose to the severe range. Slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable meteorological conditions led to poor dispersion of pollutants, worsening air quality across the region.Earlier, on January 2, CAQM had lifted GRAP-III curbs after a significant improvement in air quality.However, with pollution levels rising again, the restrictions have been reimposed to prevent further deterioration.Under Stage 3 curbs, non-essential construction and demolition activities have been banned. These include earthwork, piling, open trenching, welding, painting, plastering, tile and flooring work, along with operations at ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants.Transportation of construction materials such as cement, sand, and fly ash on unpaved roads has also been prohibited.Stone crushers, brick kilns, mining activities, and industries using unapproved fuels have been ordered to shut.Vehicular restrictions include a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, non-essential diesel-powered medium goods vehicles, and inter-state diesel buses that do not run on CNG, electricity, or BS-VI standards.At the same time, exemptions have been provided for essential services. Infrastructure and public service projects such as metro, railway, airport, highway, defence, healthcare, and sanitation works will continue.Construction related to critical projects is allowed under strict dust control and waste management norms. Persons with disabilities may use exempted vehicles, public transport is encouraged, and schools may operate in hybrid or online mode up to Grade 5.Authorities will continue to monitor air quality and take further action as required.","Delhi-NCR has been grappling with high pollution levels for several months.

BJP leader K Annamalai hit back at MNS chief Raj Thackeray, daring him to stop his entry into Mumbai, a day after Thackeray mocked him as “rasmalai” and questioned his right to comment on the city.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me?

I don’t know whether I have become that important,” Annamalai said.“Some have written that they will cut my legs if I come to Mumbai. I will come to Mumbai—try cutting my legs. If I were afraid of such threats, I would have stayed in my village. If I say Kamaraj is one of India’s greatest leaders, does it mean he is no longer a Tamil?

Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: In a big setback to actor Vijay, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea against an order of stay passed by a division bench of the Madras high court over the certification of his movie ""Jana Nayagan"".The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.A bench of Justices Deepankar Datta and AG Masih asked the Madras high court to decide the matter by January 20.On January 9, the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order directing the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to immediately grant a censor certificate to Jana Nayagan, leaving the fate of actor-turned-politician Vijay’s film uncertain.KVN Productions LLP moved an appeal against the single judge’s directive, after a division bench of the high court last Friday put the order on hold and restrained the CBFC from issuing the certificate.Vijay recently launched his political party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.“Jana Nayagan”, widely projected as Vijay’s final film before his full-time entry into politics, was scheduled for a Pongal release on January 9.However, the release hit last-minute hurdles after the CBFC failed to issue certification in time.The division bench’s order came hours after Justice P T Asha directed the CBFC to clear “Jana Nayagan”, setting aside the film board’s decision to refer the matter to a review committee.Subsequently, the first bench comprising Chief Justice M M Shrivastava and Justice G Arul Murugan, acting on an appeal filed by the CBFC, granted an interim stay on the single judge’s verdict.Earlier, while allowing KVN Productions’ plea seeking a direction to the CBFC to issue the censor certificate, Justice Asha held that once the board had decided to grant certification, the chairperson had no authority to refer the film to a review committee.The film board immediately challenged the order before the division bench.","The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.

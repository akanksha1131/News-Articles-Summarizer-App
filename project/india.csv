CBI raids Bhupesh Baghel's residence; former Chhattisgarh CM reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-conducts-searches-at-former-chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghels-residence/articleshow/119511641.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday conducted searches at the residence of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.According to officials, the investigating agency raided Baghel's residences in Raipur and Bhilai, as well as the residential premises of a senior police officer and a close associate of the former chief minister.Reacting to the raids, Baghel suggested that the actions were taken to prevent him from attending a key Congress meeting scheduled for April 8 and 9 in Ahmedabad.Taking to X, Baghel said, ""Now the CBI has arrived. Today, former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel is scheduled to travel to Delhi for a meeting of the 'Drafting Committee' formed for the AICC meeting to be held in Ahmedabad (Gujarat) on the upcoming 8th and 9th of April.""""Even before that, the CBI has already reached his residences in Raipur and Bhilai,"" he added.This comes days after the Enforcement Directorate raided Baghel's residence in connection with an alleged liquor scam.The central investigating agency seized approximately Rs 30 lakh in cash, using a counting machine, at the former chief minister’s residence.The probe was linked to an alleged liquor scam that the central agency believes caused a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer. Authorities claim that those involved in the liquor syndicate had siphoned off around Rs 2,161 crore through various schemes.The ED investigation so far has revealed that the liquor syndicate operated between 2019 and 2022, generating a large amount of illegal commissions through multiple methods. One of the ways was to collect bribes from the distillers for each liquor 'case' procured by the state liquor body.The alleged scam also involved the sale of country liquor from state-run shops, which remained entirely unaccounted for. The ED believes that not a single rupee reached the state exchequer, with all the money pocketed by the syndicate suspects.","Bhupesh Baghel suggested that the actions were taken to prevent him from attending a key Congress meeting scheduled for April 8 and 9.

He was one of the accused in CBI’s long-winded probe into the alleged bribery in the Bofors gun deal after the kickback was first reported by the Swedish state radio in 1987.Bhatia alleged that defence files during Rajiv’s term would be taken to Quattrocchi so that he could change them to favour companies of his choice. The current Congress leadership, including party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, should answer if it was no violation of oath by Rajiv, he said at a press conference.He alleged that Quattrocchi’s bank accounts were defrozen by CBI in 2005 during Congress-led UPA rule at the behest of Sonia. “Sonia and Rahul should resign from their position till they make a full disclosure about their family’s relations with Quattrocchi.

PM set to open new bridge to Rameswaram on Ram Navami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-set-to-open-new-bridge-to-rameswaram-on-ram-navami/articleshow/119509551.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the new Pamban bridge in Tamil Nadu on Ram Navami (April 6), which will improve rail connectivity to Rameswaram - one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites.Rameswaram is believed to be the place where Lord Ram built the bridge to Lanka, as recounted in the Ramayana, to defeat Ravan. Over 25 lakh pilgrims visit the Rameswaram temple annually and the upgraded infrastructure is expected to be a bigger boost to tourism and pilgrimage.As far as symbolisms go, the significance of the likelihood of PM inaugurating the bridge on the day of Ram Navami, the day when Hindus believe Lord Ram was born, is big enough. But what makes it even more interesting is the timing of the likely inauguration-when DMK govt in Tamil Nadu has virtually been on a warpath against Centre over the language issue and yet-to-be announced delimination.The new bridge, country's first vertical sea bridge, is expected to ensure greater comfort for travellers.Sources said the preparation for commercial opening of the sea bridge is in full swing and top railway officials from Southern Railway have been inspecting the bridge and the Rameswaram railway station in the past few days. The inauguration is likely soon after the PM returns from his two-day trip (April 4 and 5) to Sri Lanka, they added.The little over 2-km rail bridge is an engineering marvel that reconnects the mainland to Rameswaram Island, replacing the old corroded bridge. The old bridge constructed in 1914 was the only link between Rameswaram and the mainland, and was a cultural icon for over 110 years. This was the country's first sea bridge and was a lifeline for locals, pilgrims, and traders. Exposure to saltwater and aging infrastructure caused severe corrosion, which eventually led to its closure in 2022.Officials said the new one isn't just a replacement, but a more modern and efficient one as it can accommodate growing traffic volumes, ensure durability and facilitate maritime navigation. Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new bridge in Nov 2019 and actual construction began three months later.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the new Pamban bridge in Tamil Nadu on Ram Navami (April 6) The bridge will improve rail connectivity to Rameswaram - one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites.

FIR filed against Kamra



'I will not apologise'



Political leaders react



Another video by Kamra in response



Sanjay Raut defends Kamra



'Freedom of expression has limits': Shinde



More allegations and threats against Kamra



NEW DELHI: A stand-up comedy performance by Kunal Kamra ignited a political storm in Maharashtra, leading to violent protests, legal action, and heated exchanges among political leaders. His latest show, which was released online on Sunday, included sharp jabs at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde , provoking outrage among the Shinde-led faction of Shiv Sena Kamra’s sharp political commentary included a parody of a popular Hindi song from 'Dil Toh Pagal Hai', in which he referred to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). His jokes also touched upon recent political turmoil in Maharashtra, including the splits between Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The performance provoked an immediate reaction from Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction. Party workers stormed the Unicontinental Hotel’s Habitat Comedy Club Studio on Monday, ransacking the venue in protest against Kamra’s remarks.The police responded, arresting Shiv Sena functionary Rahul Kanal and 11 others for the attack. However, a magistrate’s court granted them bail the same day.Amid the uproar, an FIR was registered against Kamra in Thane district for allegedly defaming Eknath Shinde. The case, filed at Dombivli police station by a Shiv Sena functionary, charges Kamra under Section 356(2) (defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Despite the backlash, Kamra remained defiant. He issued a strong response on the same day as the vandalism, refusing to apologize. ""I will not apologise,"" he clarified in a post on X, taking aim at both the ""mob and politicians"" who were outraged by his jokes.The row quickly rocketed into a political slugfest, with leaders from different parties weighing in. Maharashtra minister of state for home Yogesh Ramdas Kadam condemned Kamra’s comments, warning of consequences.""He will be punished. If you are going to insult the Supreme Court, PM of India, Hindu Gods and Goddesses, it is not tolerable. You cannot behave like this in Maharashtra or India... We do enjoy comedy, but this is not the kind of comedy that will be tolerated in Maharashtra,"" Kadam said.Kamra, in turn, responded with another satirical video on Tuesday, mocking the Shiv Sena workers who vandalised the comedy club. He posted a clip of himself singing ""Hum Honge Kangaal"", interspersed with footage of the destruction caused by party workers.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut came out strongly in support of Kamra, arguing that the comedian would not bow to pressure.""I know Kamra. We share the same DNA. He is a fighter,"" Raut told reporters. ""He won’t apologize. If you have to act against him, you have to take recourse to lawful steps.""His comments provoked a sharp reaction from Maharashtra Minister Yogesh Kadam, who retorted, ""The DNA of Kamra and Raut could be the same. He (Kamra) is mad, and so is this person (Raut).""BJP MLC Parinay Phuke also weighed in, alleging that Kamra was being supported by opposition parties. ""The Congress or other parties are supporting Kamra. Their DNA must be the same because the DNA of scoundrels is the same,"" he said.Eknath Shinde himself responded to the controversy, defending freedom of expression but warning against its misuse.""Right to express is important in a democracy, but to say anything in the guise of it and on the instruction of somebody is wrong,"" he said. ""He said many things about PM Modi, CJI, FM Sitharaman, HM Shah. He has been saying such things. Many airlines have banned him. Who is behind him? I don’t worry, there have been many allegations against him. I don’t support the vandalism of the studio—that was due to the emotions of the party workers. This looks like a well-thought-out conspiracy.""Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, in an exclusive interview with ANI, addressed the issue, saying, ""Freedom of expression should not be misused as a tool for attacks. Unfortunately, some people treat free speech as their inherent right to create divisions and further polarise the country.""Adding to the row, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske alleged on Tuesday that Kamra had been paid to make such statements as part of a conspiracy to divert attention from the Disha Salian case .""It does not matter whether Kunal Kamra apologises or not, he has talked about our leader, our worker will give him 'prasad', it does not matter whether is sweet or bitter, he will himself tell about that. He will get the reaction of Shiv Sena,"" he said.""Kunal Kamra has been given money to make such statements to divert people's attention away from Disha Salian’s case. Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut are left with no workers, which is why they are putting forward people like Kunal Kamra,"" Mhaske told ANI.He also issued a veiled threat, warning that Kamra would not be able to move around freely in Maharashtra.""He will face the reaction as Shiv Sena is a party of reaction. We are Shiv Sainiks, and if someone talks rubbish about our leader, we will not tolerate that. We are ready to face all the consequences, but Kunal Kamra cannot roam freely in Maharashtra and India,"" Mhaske said.","Kunal Kamra's latest show included sharp jabs at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister K N Rajanna after consulting legal experts and chief minister Siddaramaiah.The statement followed Rajanna’s formal request for action, in which he described encountering unfamiliar individuals and raised concerns about whether they acted independently or had external backing.The decision came hours after Parameshwara told reporters in Bengaluru that Rajanna had yet to file a complaint on the matter.""I will file a complaint today and submit it to the home minister because I had spoken about it in the Assembly and had said I would do so. Until today, I was unable to write the complaint due to various work-related commitments,"" Rajanna said.Speaking to reporters, he added, ""I have personally written the complaint and will submit it to the home minister today.

I have detailed everything that happened in a three-page complaint.""Initially dismissing the issue as a common occurrence, Rajanna said he took it seriously after his name was mentioned in the Assembly.""I have not installed CCTV cameras in my Bengaluru house. If they were there, we could have identified who came and went,"" he said.He mentioned that the individuals involved were strangers and stressed the need to investigate whether they acted alone or had backing.Among those who allegedly attempted to ""honeytrap"" him, Rajanna said the same man appeared both times, but the woman accompanying him was different on each occasion.""The woman who came the second time claimed to be a high court lawyer. However, she was not wearing a lawyer's coat but was dressed in jeans and a blue top. They approached me, stating they had something important and confidential to discuss. I can recognise them if I see their photos,"" he said.Last Thursday, Rajanna had informed the Assembly that honeytrap attempts were made on him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen victim to such schemes.The revelation sparked a stir in the Assembly, prompting the home minister to announce a high-level probe while the opposition demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge.Reacting to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court, Rajanna dismissed claims that he had mentioned judges in his statements.""Have I said anything about judges? I haven't. I only said that such attempts have been made on political leaders from all parties by their opponents to settle political scores. I never mentioned judges. Yet, someone has filed a PIL claiming that I did and that the case should be handed over to the CBI,"" he said, calling the petition misleading and based on ""false information.""Asked about his travel plans, Rajanna said he would visit Delhi after March 30.When questioned about informing the Congress high command, he replied, ""The matter has already reached the high command. They have not asked me anything personally, so I haven't spoken to them. However, they have gathered information on their own and have spoken to the chief minister about it.""Addressing concerns about discussing the issue in the Assembly, Rajanna admitted he should have brought it up within the cabinet or party first but felt compelled to speak after BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal mentioned his name while referring to alleged ""honey trapping"" attempts.","Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister K N Rajanna.

DRI advocate Madhu Rao also informed the court that actress Rao admitted to hawala connection.The decision comes after a detailed hearing where both the defence and prosecution presented their arguments.During the proceedings, Rao's counsel, Kiran Jawali, argued for her release, while Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) advocate Madhu Rao submitted evidence indicating her direct involvement in the illicit transfer of funds.The prosecution stated that the actress admitted to using hawala channels to facilitate gold purchases, further strengthening the case against her.Madhu Rao told the court, ""Money has been sent to Ranya Rao through hawala, she has confessed that.""Ranya Rao had approached the sessions court after a special court denied her bail on the basis of objections raised by the DRI.The high-profile case revolves around allegations of gold smuggling through unauthorised channels.The actress, daughter of DGP-ranked officer Ramachandra Rao , was intercepted by DRI officials last week at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). She was allegedly found carrying 14.2 kg of gold strapped to her body while being escorted by a constable out of the airport's arrival terminal.When questioned about an inquiry report by additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta regarding the case, the Karnataka home minister said he was unaware of its status and unsure whether an interim report had been submitted to the chief minister.

He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru.

Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed.

SC order sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases

NEW DELHI: Observing that the act of cutting a large number of trees was worse than killing a human being, Supreme Court on Tuesday said no mercy should be shown to people who damage the environment and approved imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for each illegally cut tree.Sending out a clear message that those indulging in illegal cutting of trees without approval from the authority concerned and damaging the environment must be dealt with an iron hand, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the plea of a man who had cut down 454 trees in the protected Taj Trapezium Zone.The bench accepted the suggestion of senior advocate ADN Rao, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, that a clear message needed to be sent to offenders that the law and trees could not, and should not, be taken for granted. With its order, the court has set a benchmark on how much fine should be imposed in such cases.“No mercy in environmental case. Felling a large number of trees is worse than killing a human. It will take at least 100 years minimum to again regenerate or recreate the green cover created by 454 trees which were blatantly cut without permission of this court though the embargo imposed by this court is right from the year 2015,” the bench said.The court accepted the report of the central empowered committee (CEC), which recommended a fine of Rs 1 lakh per tree for 454 trees which were cut last year by one Shiv Shankar Agarwal. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for him, told the bench that his client had admitted the mistake and apologised and urged the court to reduce the fine amount, which he said was exorbitant. He also said Agarwal should be allowed to do plantations at a nearby site and not on the same plot. Refusing to reduce the fine amount, the court, however, allowed him to do plantations in nearby areas.In its report, CEC said 454 trees were illegally felled on the night of Sept 18 last year out of which 422 trees were on private land known as Dalmia Farm situated at Vrindavan Chatikara Road, and the remaining 32 trees were on the roadside strip adjoining this private land which was a protected forest.Observing that the report revealed the shocking state of affairs and blatant violation of the SC’s order, the bench initiated contempt proceedings against Agarwal and asked CEC to suggest further measures to be taken against him.The panel suggested that the forest department should recover the penalty due under the provisions of UP Protection of Trees Act, 1976, for this illegal felling and the department should also take punitive action against the land owner for felling 32 trees that were in the protected forest as per the provisions under the Indian Forest Act, 1972",SC order sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases.

Nishant suggested that performing a ritual for Rs 6,300 could cleanse his life of negativity, police told news agency PTI.The software engineer, after a week of rumination, decided to go ahead with the ponzi prophecy.He reached out to Nishant, who assured him that a "" Bade Maharaj "" would personally conduct the sacred '' to heal his fate.""Nishant facilitated the conversation between the software engineer and Bade Maharaj through a conference call,"" according to the FIR. Later, what followed makes a classic case of spiritual extortion .Bade Maharaj demanded Rs 15,300 to begin the ritual and later added another Rs 28,000 under different reasons. Trusting their words, the victim made the payments electronically, police confirmed.When the techie asked for proof that the rituals had been performed, the fraudsters turned up the pressure.""When the victim demanded proof that rituals were performed by Bade Maharaj, the latter called up in the night and demanded an additional Rs 20,000, saying some rituals are incomplete,"" police said.The software engineer, skeptical but scared, hesitated.

With panic creeping in, the victim found himself tangled deeper in the scam.Nishant reconnected him with Bade Maharaj, and by this time, he had transferred Rs 2.41 lakh. But the fraudsters weren’t done yet.The psychological pressure intensified—warnings of impending doom if the rituals weren't completed pushed the victim into financial freefall.He maxed out his credit cards, borrowed from private lenders, and continued paying, desperate to ""fix"" his cosmic misfortune. Over six days in January, the techie had drained Rs 12.20 lakh into the scam. The fraudsters still weren’t satisfied.It wasn't until he confided in his friends that he realised he had been played.Urged to investigate, he reached out to the customer support of DevineTalk, where a woman reassured him that the rituals would be completed—and as a gesture of goodwill, she even offered him three free meditation sessions.Skeptical, the techie checked online reviews of DevineTalk and discovered he wasn’t alone—several users had flagged the app for fraudulent activities.On Monday, the techie lodged a formal complaint with the cyber police, leading to an FIR under various sections of the BNS and the Information Technology Act (ITA).","A Mumbai-based techie turned to ""astrology"" in a bid to mend his life, unaware the only thing that was to align for him were not stars but a well-planned scam.

Rashid's counsel counters NIA's objections



Rashid's terror funding case



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh , also known as Engineer Rashid, currently jailed in a terror funding case , abides by the law while attending Parliament.The court later reserved its order on Rashid's plea to participate in the ongoing session.Discounting the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) concerns over losing control of the accused within Parliament premises, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, ""Let’s not see ghosts. Let’s not feel so powerless that ‘oh my God, inside Parliament he will do this or that.’ He will be in our custody. Our arms are long enough and strong enough to keep him in line.""After hearing submissions from both the NIA and Rashid’s counsel, a bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Bhambhani stated that a detailed order would be passed soon.The court suggested that the NIA’s apprehensions could be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on Rashid if he is permitted to attend the session, which runs until April 4. Rashid’s counsel clarified that his plea was not for custody parole but for permission to attend the House while remaining in custody. He assured the court that Rashid would strictly comply with any conditions imposed.The court specified that the Speaker and the secretary general of the Lok Sabha possess sufficient authority to maintain discipline inside Parliament.""We are not granting him bail. He is in custody, and our officers will be with him at all times, except where they are not allowed. He will be in the highest temple of democracy—inside Parliament. Do not undermine the power of the Speaker and the Secretary General to enforce discipline,"" Justice Bhambhani said.In response to the NIA’s insistence on Rashid’s role in the case, the bench assured, ""We do not for a moment undermine the seriousness of the allegations. National security is paramount.""The court also suggested allowing a prison or police official in plain clothes to accompany Rashid inside Parliament if necessary.Facing strong opposition from the NIA, Rashid’s counsel argued that the Parliament’s marshals would maintain strict control over his actions.""The moment he switches on his mic to say anything inappropriate, his mic will be taken away, and he will be thrown out,"" Rashid’s lawyer said.To this, Justice Singh said, ""Then it will become a national issue that his mic has been taken away and he has been thrown out by the marshals.""Rashid’s counsel also informed the court of plans to challenge a March 19 trial court order denying him regular bail.Rashid, an Independent MP from Baramulla who defeated Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, is facing trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a 2017 terror funding case. He was arrested by the NIA in 2019 and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since.The NIA’s case against Rashid stems from allegations that he financially aided separatists and terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.His name surfaced during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali, a co-accused in the case. A special NIA court framed charges against Rashid in 2022 under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy, sedition, and waging war against the government, along with UAPA provisions for terror funding.The Baramulla MP was previously granted interim bail for a month in September 2023 to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.The high court has now asked the NIA to suggest additional conditions that could be imposed if Rashid is allowed to attend Parliament, reserving its final decision.",Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh is currently jailed in a terror funding case.

Cannot tolerate such a process of demolition: SC

Clip of girl fleeing bulldozer sparks outrage in UP

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh govt for demolishing houses in Prayagraj within 24 hours of serving notice, saying it had ""shocked the conscience of the court"" and hinted that it would allow the aggrieved owners to rebuild their houses subject to the outcome of the case challenging the demolition. The case pertains to razing of the houses of a lawyer, a professor, and others in 2021.A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and N Kotishwar Singh, based on the claim by the aggrieved, took exception to the manner in which demolition was carried out and termed it the state's high-handedness. ""It shocks the conscience of the court the manner in which within 24 hours of the notice it was done,"" it said.The UP govt, however, disputed the version of the petitioners that the demolition squad had moved in a day after notices were served on them.Attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, argued that reasonable time was given to the petitioners to respond to the notice. He said on Dec 8, 2020, they were given the first notice, followed by notices in Jan 2021 and March 2021. The petitioners said the demolition notice was issued March 1, 2021, served on March 6, 2021, and demolition carried out on March 7.The petitioners said they were not given a reasonable opportunity to challenge the demolition notice before the appellate authority under Section 27(2) of the UP Urban Planning and Development Act.""State must act very fairly and state must give reasonable time to enable them to file an appeal before the structures are demolished. Notice served on March 6 and demolition carried out on March 7. Now, we will allow them to reconstruct,"" the bench said.The bench pointed out that the notices were served by affixture, which is not the method approved by the law and only the last notice was served through the legally recognised method.""Therefore, we are going to pass order only in the light of these facts. The manner in which the whole process has been conducted... the court cannot tolerate such a process. If we tolerate in one case, it will continue. We will pass an order that they can reconstruct at their own cost and if the appeal fails, then they will have to demolish at their own cost,"" it said.The court asked the petitioners to file an undertaking and adjourned the case. The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, Prof Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad high court dismissed their plea against the demolition.The video of an eight-year-old girl clutching her books and running away from her shanty during an anti-encroachment drive in Ambedkar Nagar’s Jalalpur area in UP has sparked widespread outrage.The footage, which surfaced on social media, showed an earthmover revving nearby, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties. Former UP CM and SP president Akhilesh Yadav condemned the demolition, calling it an example of the state’s deteriorating condition.On Monday, he posted on X, “Eight years, UP ruined, and only questions remain.” He also shared an AI-generated image of a girl holding books while a bulldozer loomed in the background.

Officials clarified that troops conducted precautionary firing after detecting suspicious movement.Security forces deployed an army helicopter above the area while joint army units, including specially-equipped commandos with heavy weaponry, sniffer dogs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, continued searching for terrorists believed to be trapped within the zone.The Special Operations Group (SOG) launched the operation after receiving intelligence about terrorists hiding in a 'dhok'—a local enclosure—at a nursery in Sanyal village, about five km from the Pakistan border, officials said.The hiding terrorists responded with intense gunfire towards the police unit, resulting in a fierce exchange lasting for more than half an hour, they said. Additional forces were promptly deployed to capture the terrorists, who allegedly infiltrated on Saturday either through ravines or via a newly constructed tunnel.Officials reported no casualties from the initial exchange, and the area remained under strict security throughout the night before forces advanced at daybreak.Despite no further contact with the terrorists, Monday's search revealed four loaded M4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, food packets, and several polythene bags, which will be examined by the bomb disposal squad, officials said.Intelligence suggests two separate groups, each comprising at least five terrorists, infiltrated on Saturday. Local residents organised food provisions for security personnel and media representatives stationed at the outer cordon.Village women gathering firewood spotted approximately five terrorists taking shelter in the large nursery area, as reported by officials.A young girl, aged seven, sustained minor wounds when a bullet grazed her arm. She was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital.According to PTI, Anita Devi, aged 48, around 4:30 pm on Sunday recounted how armed terrorists apprehended her husband whilst they were collecting firewood at the nursery.""The terrorists held my husband at gunpoint and asked me to come near. But my husband signalled me to run and I ran. One of the terrorists tried to stop me but I started shouting, which attracted the attention of two more people who were cutting grass,"" Anita Devi said.","Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district found four loaded M4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, and food supplies.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee on Tuesday accused Union agriculture and rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan of working for the wealthy and acting as a ""dalal (broker) for the rich"".He criticized the Union government for not releasing central funds to West Bengal under schemes like MGNREGA and PMAYG .Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Banerjee alleged that funds had not been given to West Bengal for three years. He claimed this was because the BJP could not form a government in the state.""Shivraj Chouhan is a 'dalal' (broker) for the rich. He doesn't work for the poor and that's why he was removed from the post of Madhya Pradesh chief minister,"" Banerjee said. He repeated the remark multiple times.During Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, MPs from the DMK and Trinamool Congress protested against what they said was a delay in MGNREGA payments to some states. The Speaker adjourned the session until noon.Banerjee, in his statement, further alleged that the Centre’s claim about 25 lakh fake job cards under MGNREGA was being used as a reason to withhold funds. He said, ""They have not given us funds for the last three years. They are saying there are some discrepancies... (that) there are 25 lakh fake job cards (under MGNREGA)... We have told them to carry forward criminal proceedings against the fake cards, but they can't deprive 10 crore people of West Bengal of the funds.""He claimed that the BJP’s failure to win West Bengal in the 2021 assembly elections was the reason for the delay in funds. ""Shivraj Chouhan and PM Narendra Modi are against Bengal. They want to form a government there and are failing. They will never come to power there. BJP leaders say don't give funds to Bengal,"" he said.The BJP responded, with minister of state for agriculture Bhagirath Choudhary demanding an apology for the remarks made against Chouhan. ""This is not a good thing, such language by a senior MP does not suit him. PM Modi is working on the principle of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'. There is no discrimination against any state and everyone is getting their share,"" Choudhary said while talking to news agency PTI.He also said, ""Unfortunately, the West Bengal government changes the names of central schemes and indulges in corruption.

NAGPUR: Mohammad Hamid Engineer , a former govt employee turned firebrand commentator, is back in the spotlight after his alleged role in mentoring key riot accused Fahim Khan . Security agencies, long familiar with Engineer's involvement in community affairs, have turned their attention to his social media activity following the Nagpur riots on the night of March 17.Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party , was arrested on March 21 for allegedly inciting the riots and charged with sedition. A long-time figure in minority politics, he had allegedly flooded social media with inflammatory posts before the riots.Engineer first gained attention over 15 years ago when his tabloid Iman Ki Awaz foreshadowed serial blasts in Gujarat and later in Jaipur. Copies of the publication were sent to top Gujarat police officers, with Engineer later claiming he had merely pointed out a growing factional dispute within his community that could lead to bloodshed over control of religious shrines.Sources said his writings exposed the influence of a hard-line sect allegedly behind acts of violence. Some security officials saw value in Engineer's revelations, using him as an insider to highlight internal rifts within his community on a broader stage.He crafted an image as an anti-terrorism crusader. But it didn't take long for him to switch from whistle-blower to wanted man. His entanglement in sectarian conflicts brought legal trouble.In 2011, Engineer found himself in custody after mob violence erupted in Nagpur's Mominpura neighbourhood over the controversial burial of Baba Mustafa, a Sufi saint who died on June 28 that year. Engineer's alleged role in the unrest, linked to internal disputes, marked the beginning of a string of legal battles.More recently, his association with Minorities Democratic Party, a group he helped establish, has raised questions. The party's city president Fahim was arrested after a video he allegedly circulated triggered riots in central and north Nagpur.The violence erupted after demonstrations demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Decorated ex-cop and 2003 President's awardee Sambhaji Patil has been enlisted to strengthen 13 riot-related cases with his legal expertise.A former vice principal of a Maharashtra police training school, Patil is now a HC lawyer. Known for his sharp investigative skills, he is guiding Nagpur police, who are struggling with legal complexities in cases involving over 1,200 accused.","Mohammad Hamid Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party, was arrested on March 21 for allegedly inciting the riots.

Several states, however, have doled out higher increases on an ad hoc basis in their legislatures.Govt sources said the mechanism introduced in 2018 ensures a fair and transparent approach to salary revisions, preventing arbitrary increases and ensuring financial prudence.The Finance Act, 2018, amended the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, to link MPs' salaries to inflation, specifically using the cost inflation index (CII) published under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The sources said before this amendment, salary revisions were conducted on an ad hoc basis and required parliamentary approval each time. The amendment aimed to ""depoliticise the process and introduce a systematic mechanism for salary adjustments"", they said.The last revision before the 2018 amendment took place in 2010, when Parliament passed a bill to increase MPs' monthly salaries from Rs 16,000 to Rs 50,000, the sources said. This decision led to significant public criticism, as many perceived it as MPs granting themselves a three-fold pay hike.However, some MPs, including Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav,demanded at least a five-fold rise in salaries, the sources said.","The Finance Act, 2018, amended the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, to link MPs' salaries to inflation.

He also launched a sharp attack on Congress's management of the PM's Relief Fund, accusing the previous UPA regime of lacking accountability and transparency.The bill was passed in Lok Sabha in Dec 2024.On the need for the amendments, Shah said, ""Some members asked what is the need for amendment. I want to tell them that if a building is not repaired in time, it collapses. They think that maybe, they will come and change it but nobody's turn will come for the next 15-20 years. Whatever has to be done, we have to do it. The Disaster Management Act was implemented for the first time in 2005. Under this, NDMA, SDMA and DDMA were formed. Now, concerns are being expressed that there will be centralisation of power. If you read the entire bill carefully, then the biggest responsibility of implementation lies with the District Disaster Management Authority which is under the state govt. Therefore, there is no possibility of harming the federal structure anywhere.""Shah emphasised that the amendment prioritised shifting from reactive disaster response to proactive risk reduction. He outlined several key measures, including real-time monitoring using AI-based systems instead of manual processes, enhanced communication strategies, moving from traditional radio announcements to digital platforms, mobile alerts and social media notifications. The reforms also aimed to expand disaster response beyond being govt-centric to a multi-dimensional, society-involved approach, he added.He also underscored India's significant progress in disaster management, which has earned both national and international recognition. Responding to criticism over India's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Shah defended the govt's actions, and described the country's response as one of the most effective globally.He also hit back at the opposition's allegations of a lack of transparency regarding the PM-Care Fund's management, clarifying that while the PM's Relief Fund was created during the UPA era, the PM-Care Fund was established under the NDA govt.","Parliament passed the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024, on Tuesday.

BENGALURU: Five days after making explosive claims in the Karnataka legislative assembly that he and 48 other political functionaries cutting across party lines had been honey-trapped, cooperation minister K N Rajanna Tuesday formally submitted a petition with home minister G Parameshwara, seeking legal action against those involved.Clarifying his earlier statement in the assembly, Rajanna denied ever saying that judges were among the victims.Rajanna handed over a three-page petition detailing the sequence of events.

Since the issue was raised in the assembly, Parameshwara said that it was speaker U T Khader who was the ""custodian of the discussion"", and his assistance was necessary to initiate any further action.Reacting to this, Khader said: ""I am not aware of the home minister's statement, but if the points raised by Rajanna are a property of the House, then the assurance by the home minister on the floor of the House is also property of the House. I shall look into the minister's statement and discuss it further.""Parameshwara chose to describe Rajanna's submission as a ""representation"" rather than a formal complaint, saying that any police action would require directives from the speaker.Congress functionaries said Rajanna's complaint, coming just before the CM completes 30 months in office, has put the party in a difficult situation. A minister said: ""If an investigation is taken to its logical conclusion and names tumble out, it could dent our credibility.

VP Dhankhar sounds out MPs on fresh look at judicial accountability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vp-dhankhar-sounds-out-mps-on-fresh-look-at-judicial-accountability/articleshow/119506769.cms,"Dhankhar at a meeting with functionaries of various parties in RS Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amid the spiralling controversy over the alleged recovery of cash from the official residence of Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma , Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday sounded out political parties on the need to think of a mechanism for putting an end to the ""judges appointing judges"" regime.At a meeting with political parties, Dhankhar asked representatives of political parties to come together on the issue. Earlier, speaking in Rajya Sabha, he described the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, enacted in 2014 with unanimous support with a view to end the monopoly of the Supreme Court Collegium over appointment of judges of SC and HCs, as a ""visionary step"". Dhankhar faulted the apex court's decision to quash the law.""Now is the befitting occasion to reiterate that it was a visionary step endorsed by Parliament,"" Dhankhar said, remarks which he is learnt to have reiterated during a meeting leaders of political parties on fixing the accountability of judges.In RS, Dhankhar also criticised SC's decision to strike down the NJAC Act. ""There is no constitutional provision of review or appeal of a constitutional amendment. If there is a legislation (passed) by Parliament or state legislatures, judicial review can take place only on whether it is in conformity with the constitutional provisions,"" he said.The deliberations were held against the backdrop of demands in both Houses of Parliament for a discussion over the alleged recovery of cash from Justice Varma's official residence. Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar said the country would have been spared of the scandal had the NJAC Act not been struck down by SC in 2015.While the discussion with political parties remained inconclusive, it was decided to hold more rounds. Sources said Dhankhar, a vocal spokesperson for parliamentary supremacy, asserted that this was the time to do something about "" judicial accountability "". Opposition leaders, including Congress president and leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge and TMC's Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, are learnt to have asked the govt to outline the steps it wants to take.It is learnt that members cutting across party lines agreed that the fire-and-cash incident had raised serious concerns about the working of judiciary and that it must be addressed. According to a source, Trinamool MPs demanded the issue be discussed on the floor of the House, and not in the ""antechamber"".Leader of house in RS JP Nadda is learnt to have suggested that separate discussions be held with political parties on the course of action, including building a consensus on holding a discussion on the issue in the House, which was agreed upon by floor leaders.The meeting was attended by leaders from BJP, including Nadda and Kiren Rijiju; Kharge and Jairam Ramesh from Congress, Sasmit Patra from BJD, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, DMK's Tiruchi Siva, Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut, CPM's John Brittas, AAP's Sanjay Singh, and members from YSRCP and AGP.","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar asked representatives of political parties to come together on the issue.

Supreme Court to speaker: Why no decision on defecting BRS MLAs after 1 yr?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-speaker-why-no-decision-on-defecting-brs-mlas-after-1-yr/articleshow/119504842.cms,"SC: Why hasn’t Telangana Speaker set a deadline?

NEW DELHI: Noting that the application to disqualify three BRS MLAs who allegedly defected to Congress is pending for almost a year before the Telangana assembly speaker, Supreme Court on Tuesday asked why there no decision has been taken one way or the other. The court wondered if the decision would be taken after the assembly's term ends.Hearing a plea filed by BRS MLAs seeking the court's direction to the speaker to decide within four weeks, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih said it is prima facie of the view that the court can interfere if the decision is not taken within a reasonable time.The Supreme Court bench said certain observations passed by SC in the Subhash Desai case (Shiv Sena rift matter) favour BRS which seeks disqualification of its MLAs.“As on today, how much time has passed since the first application? It appears to be a year. Why has not the Speaker’s office set a deadline for deciding these petitions?” the court observed.Senior advocates C A Sundaram and D Seshadri Naidu, appearing for BRS MLAs seeking the disqualification, told the bench high court had in Sept 2024 asked the Speaker to fix a hearing schedule within four weeks but no notice was issued until Jan this year.They said one of the defected MLAs had even contested the Lok Sabha polls on Congress ticket and lost and continued to be MLA.They said only after SC passed observation in an earlier hearing, the Speaker issued notice on Feb 13 to MLAs and granted them three weeks time to respond. But that deadline passed and there is no clarity on the status of the disqualification petitions, they told the bench. The hearing will resume on April 3.Objecting to the delay on the part of the Speaker in taking decision, the apex court had earlier said the rights of political parties could not be permitted to be frustrated in a democracy",Supreme Court asks why there no decision has been taken one way or the other.

NEW DELHI: The bogey of foreign interference continues to plague India-Canada ties with Ottawa listing India among countries that could interfere in the Canadian elections that will be held on April 28.A top Canadian intelligence official said Monday that India has both intent and wherewithal to interfere in Canada’s democratic processes.Canada has in the past too accused India of interfering in its domestic politics. Canadian Security Intelligence Service deputy director Vanessa Lloyd said it was China that was likely to use AI to influence the election campaign but added that India, Russia and Pakistan could also interfere in the elections.“We have also seen that the govt of India has the intent and capability to interfere in Canadian communities and democratic processes to assert its geopolitical influence,” said the official.Canadian PM Mark Carney , who replaced Justin Trudeau earlier this month, has called snap polls on April 28 seeking a strong mandate in the middle of an internecine tariff war with the Trump administration, or what he has described as “the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty”.The remarks by the Canadian official follow a period of relative quiet and dialling down of tensions that have rocked the relationship since Trudeau accused New Delhi of facilitating the murder of a Khalistani separatist and Canadian national, Hardeep Singh Nijjar . Carney has expressed interest in rebuilding ties with India, and Indian govt too has said it hopes to do the same based on mutual trust and sensitivity.CTV News quoted the official as also saying that Pakistan could conduct foreign interference activities against Canada in line with its strategic aims and to counter India’s influence. “Pakistan could potentially conduct foreign interference against Canada in line with its strategic aims to promote political, security and economic stability in Pakistan and to counter India’s growing global influence,” added Lloyd.","Canada has in the past too accused India of interfering in its domestic politics.

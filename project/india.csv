Pahalgam attack 'economic warfare'

Jaishankar debunks Trump's trade 'warning'

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday again reiterated in no uncertain terms that India would not yield to nuclear blackmail and that New Delhi was ""not going to fall for"" the world worrying about the consequences of attacking nuclear-armed Pakistan.Jaishankar said terrorists would be dealt with ""no impunity"" and even the government that backs such terror outfits won't be spared.""We are very clear there will be no impunity for terrorists, that we will not deal with them any longer as proxies and spare the government which supports and finances and in many ways, motivates them. We will not allow nuclear blackmail to prevent us from responding,” Jaishankar said during an interview with Newsweek hosted at the publication’s headquarters at One World Trade Centre near the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan.The external affairs minister said, “we've also heard this for too long” that both India and Pakistan are nuclear countries and “therefore the other guy will come and do horrible things, but you mustn't do anything because it gets the world worried"".“Now we are not going to fall for that. If he is going to come and do things, we are going to go there and also hit the people who did this. So no yielding to nuclear blackmail, no impunity to terrorists, no more free pass that they are proxies.And we will do what we have to do to defend our people,” Jaishankar said amid applause from the audience.Jaishankar described the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam as an act of “economic warfare” intended to destroy tourism in Kashmir.Referring to a long pattern of cross-border attacks, Jaishankar said there was a sentiment in the country that “enough is enough”.He pointed out that the Pakistan-based terrorists targeting India do not operate in secrecy, and likened their infrastructure to corporate entities housed openly in urban areas.“These are terrorist organisations who have the ‘equivalent of their corporate headquarters in the populated towns of Pakistan,’” he said.“Everybody knows what is the headquarters of organisation A and organisation B and those are the buildings, the headquarters that India destroyed,” he added.India launched Operation Sindoor in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre, striking at terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility for the attack. In the operation, the forces hit hotbeds of terror in Pakistan's Bahawalpur and Muridke.During a Q&A session after the discussion, Jaishankar was asked whether President Donald Trump's claim of using trade to halt the recent India-Pakistan conflict had impacted ongoing trade negotiations between New Delhi and Washington.“No, I don't think so. I think the trade people are doing what the trade people should be doing, which is negotiate with numbers and lines and products and do their trade-offs. I think they are very professional and very, very focused about it,” Jaishankar said.He said that there is a national consensus in India that “our dealings with Pakistan are bilateral.“And in this particular case, I can tell you that I was in the room when Vice President (JD) Vance spoke to Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi on the night of May 9, saying that the Pakistanis would launch a very massive assault on India if we did not accept certain things.“And the Prime Minister was impervious to what the Pakistanis were threatening to do. On the contrary, he indicated that there would be a response from us. This was the night before and the Pakistanis did attack us massively that night, we responded very quickly thereafter,"" Jaishankar said.""And the next morning, Mr (Secretary of State Marco) Rubio called me up and said the Pakistanis were ready to talk. So I can only tell you from my personal experience what happened. The rest I leave to you,"" he said.","Jaishankar said terrorists would be dealt with ""no impunity"" and even the government that backs such terror outfits won't be spared. The external affairs minister said, “we've also heard this for too long” that both India and Pakistan are nuclear countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122172930,imgsize-32366,width-400,resizemode-4/122172930.jpg"

Enemies may exist across borders but there should be none within the country.

But when expression becomes repressive, intolerant or dismissive of opposing views, it loses its meaning. Constructive debate is essential.

A 24-year-old Indian woman has gone missing just days after she arrived in the United States for an arranged marriage, authorities in New Jersey said this week.The woman, identified as Simran, landed in the US on June 20. She reportedly arrived in the country for an arranged marriage. However, investigators say there’s a possibility she never intended to follow through with the marriage and may have used the opportunity as a way to travel to the US.Surveillance footage obtained by Lindenwold Police shows her standing alone, looking at her phone and appearing to wait for someone. Officials noted that she did not seem distressed in the video, New York Post reported.Simran was last seen wearing gray sweatpants, a white T-shirt, black flip flops, and small diamond-studded earrings. She stands about 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs approximately 150 pounds, and has a small scar on the left side of her forehead.Simran has no known relatives in the United States and does not speak English. Her phone is an international device that only functions via Wi-Fi, further complicating efforts to contact her.Police said they have also been unable to get in touch with her family in India.Authorities are urging anyone with information about Simran’s whereabouts to contact Lindenwold Police Detective Joe Tomasetti.","The woman, identified as Simran, landed in the US on June 20.

The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials.

Then there’s crookery with ambition. What would have been a flight of fancy for most practionists of this art was clandestinely turned into reality by a mother-son duo in Punjab’s Ferozepur sometime in 1997.A World War-II era airstrip, used by Indian Air Force during the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars as an advanced landing ground, was allegedly sold off by a mother and son in 1997 in connivance with some revenue officials. Now, 28 years later, accused Usha Ansal and her son Naveen Chand have been named in an FIR.The Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered Punjab Vigilance Bureau (VB) chief director to probe the allegation, and the report, filed on June 20, has led to the FIR. The case has been registered under IPC Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), and 120B (criminal conspiracy). DSP Karan Sharma is heading the investigation to identify all those involved in this long-concealed scam involving strategic defence land.The airstrip is in Fattuwala village, very close to Pakistan border. It was only in May 2025, after HC intervention, that the land was finally restored to ministry of defence.The VB inquiry confirmed that the land belongs to IAF. Acquired on March 12, 1945 by the British administration for use in World War II, it has remained in IAF possession and was used in three wars. According to the probe, accused Usha and Naveen, of Dumni Wala village, deceitfully claimed ownership of the land and sold it off in collusion with a section of revenue officials after forging revenue records.The original complaint was filed by whistleblower Nishan Singh, a retired revenue official, but nothing happened for years. In 2021, the commandant of Halwara Air Force Station wrote to Ferozepur deputy commissioner demanding a probe. Still nothing happened.Nishan filed a petition in HC seeking an inquiry. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the original owner of the land, Madan Mohal Lal, died in 1991. However, the sale deeds were executed in 1997 and the names of Surjit Kaur, Manjit Kaur, Mukhtiar Singh, Jagir Singh, Dara Singh, Ramesh Kant, and Rakesh Kant were shown as owners in the Jamabandi from 2009-10, although the military had never transferred the land to them.HC reprimanded Ferozepur deputy commissioner for inaction, pointing out the potential threat to national security. In his order, Justice Harjit Singh Brar asked Punjab VB chief director to personally verify the veracity of the allegations and, if required, take action. He was asked to conclude the probe within four weeks.","Usha Ansal and her son Naveen Chand have been named in an FIR. A World War-II era airstrip, used by Indian Air Force during the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars, was allegedly sold off by a mother and son in 1997 in connivance with some revenue officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122168384,imgsize-1055834,width-400,resizemode-4/122168384.jpg"
"38 hours after AI 171 crash: AI Boeing 777 got 'stall, ground proximity & don’t sink warning’ on take off from Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/38-hours-after-ai-171-crash-ai-boeing-777-got-stall-ground-proximity-dont-sink-warning-on-take-off-from-delhi/articleshow/122168144.cms,"NEW DELHI: Yet another Air India wide body aircraft had a close shave within 38 hours of the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad. Immediately after taking off from Delhi in the early hours of June 14, a Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning. It also got ground proximity warning system’s (GPWS) don’t sink caution, asking pilots not to lose altitude as the aircraft operating as AI 187 had witnessed altitude loss of about 900 feet during climb.Luckily, pilots recovered the aircraft from this precarious situation and safely proceeded to the destination. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the incident; have already summoned AI’s head of safety for this case and both the pilots have been taken off flying duty pending the investigation.According to flight tracking sites, the B777 (VT-ALJ) took off at 2.56 am on June 14 in bad weather. Delhi was witnessing a thunderstorm that time. “The aircraft was involved in an inflight occurrence of stick shaker and GPWS caution. Soon after takeoff, stick shaker warning and GPWS don’t sink caution appeared. Stall warning came once and GPWS caution came twice. There was an altitude loss of around 900 feet during climb.Subsequently, the crew recovered the aircraft and continued the flight to Vienna,” said officials aware of the incident.Stick shaker refers to the control column on the flight deck shaking and making a noise to indicate something is not right and that the pilots’ attention to the situation is urgently required. In this case the pilots did that and saved the day. The flight landed safely in Vienna after 9 hours and 8 minutes. After this technical halt in Europe necessitated by longer routes taken these days due to enroute airspace closures, the aircraft then proceeded to Toronto with another set of crew members.However, the flight report for Delhi-Vienna sector only had the “stick shaker due turbulence after takeoff mentioned and not the other occurrences in detail,” said officials. When authorities examined the B777’s flight data recorder (DFDR), possibly as part of the enhanced surveillance ordered by the DGCA after AI 171 crash, the other occurrences of GPWS don’t sink caution and stall warning appearing came to light, they say.An AI spokesperson said: “Upon receipt of the pilot's report, the matter was disclosed to DGCA in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, upon receipt of data from the aircraft's recorders, further investigation was initiated. The pilots have been off-rostered pending the outcome of the investigation.”Both the pilots have been off rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation. The regulator has taken a very stern view on the June 14 incident. It is learnt AI head of safety was summoned on this issue.Following AI 171 crash, the DGCA had on June 17 raised “concern regarding recent maintenance-related issues” reported by Air India and directed the airline to strictly focus on safety while “strengthen(ing) internal coordination across engineering, operations, ground handling units.”Multiple industry insiders said: “Old Air India (PSU time) did not have comfortable planes running on time but safety was never an issue. Now planes, at least the narrow body fleet, are better but passengers are apprehensive about safety after the terrible AI 171 crash. The new management and the new owner need to win back passenger and employee trust at the earliest by doing all it takes.""",A Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning.

"Deal deadline 8 days away, US talks stay deadlocked",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-deadline-8-days-away-us-talks-stay-deadlocked/articleshow/122168388.cms,"Even at 10% base tariff, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors: Officials

NEW DELHI: With eight days to go for US to restart reciprocal tariffs, there appears to be a stalemate in India-US trade talks, with New Delhi hardening its position on offering duty concessions on agricultural products.Although the Indian team led by chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal has stayed back in Washington for talks with American officials, the absence of a deal by July 8 will expose exporters to 26% reciprocal tariff. US president Donald Trump has indicated that an extension of the suspension is unlikely.The Americans are very keen to get India to lower duties on maize, soybean, dairy products, apples, and other fruits and nuts - a tough ask for the Narendra Modi govt, given the dependence of a large number of small farmers on these products, and the likely political noise over the concessions. The govt has refused to open the agriculture and dairy sector as part of free trade agreements with Australia and the UK and has conveyed its reluctance to the European Union too.But the US has asserted that any deal without lower duties on agricultural products was not acceptable, even if the opening up was for limited quantities, known as quotas in trade parlance.Indian negotiators are also worried that in return for concessions on automobiles and whiskey, they are not receiving sufficient benefits for products such as garments, home textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, and auto components.In fact, there are fears that some of the auto parts and iron and aluminium items may continue to attract sectoral tariffs, which face additional sectoral tariffs of 25% or 50%, depending on the item.Despite the divergent positions, both sides are working on a mini-deal in the run-up to the first tranche of the bilateral trade agreement by Fall (Sept-Oct), the deadline set by Modi and Trump when they met earlier this year.During a meeting with exporters on Monday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal did not completely rule out the possibility of a deal over the next few days, suggesting that sectors that may get left out in the first round should not lose hope as more items will be added later.While the Americans have virtually ruled out lowering tariffs to zero, at least immediately, officials have told exporters that even at 10%, which is the base tariff imposed by Trump, in case of a deal, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors who will face reciprocal tariffs.Privately, several industry representatives have met the commerce department brass and suggested that India should agree to the demands from the Trump administration, but govt is keen to ensure that it is not a one-sided deal.For Trump too, showing success through agreements with countries such as the UK, China and India is critical to get the others to the negotiating table. Last Thursday, after the pact with China, the American president had announced that a ""very big deal"" with India was expected.","The Americans are very keen to get India to lower duties on maize, soybean, dairy products, apples, and other fruits and nuts.

"Post Op Sindoor, India to fast-track launch of 52 defence surveillance satellites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-op-sindoor-india-to-fast-track-launch-of-52-defence-surveillance-satellites/articleshow/122149971.cms,"'Jo Hume Chhedega…': PM Modi’s Speech on Operation Sindoor Cut Short by Audience. Here's Why

Poll Do you support India's initiative to launch 52 dedicated satellites for armed forces? Yes No

NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.

NEW DELHI: Most parts of India are likely to receive above-normal rainfall in July, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday, warning of potential flooding in Uttarakhand and Haryana. With monsoon activity intensifying, authorities have been urged to monitor river catchment areas closely and remain on alert for landslides and waterlogging, particularly in vulnerable states like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand.Addressing a virtual briefing, IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra outlined the core areas expected to receive intense precipitation this month. These include:""We should monitor the catchment areas of rivers such as the Godavari, Mahanadi and Krishna,"" Mohapatra said. ""ur models show a high probability of above-normal rainfall in the upper Mahanadi catchment, which includes Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. There are several other rivers in the region. We must closely watch rainfall activity and the water levels in reservoirs.""the northeast, large parts of eastern India, and the extreme southern peninsula are expected to see below-normal rainfall. Temperatures are likely to remain normal to below normal in most areas, although above-normal maximum temperatures may affect parts of the northeast, northwest, east, and south.In Himachal Pradesh, the IMD has issued an orange alert for Kangra, Mandi, Sirmaur, and Shimla districts, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated locations. Over the past 24 hours, Pandoh (Mandi) recorded the highest rainfall at 130 mm, followed by Mandi town (120 mm) and Sunni (113 mm) in Shimla.Senior IMD scientist Sandeep Kumar Sharma confirmed that rainfall activity will remain high until July 1, after which intensity is expected to taper off slightly. However, intermittent moderate showers will continue across the plains and mid-hill districts until July 6.So far, Himachal has recorded 34% above-normal rainfall for the monsoon season, with Mandi, Solan, and Hamirpur districts reporting particularly high figures. Tribal districts Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti, however, remain in a rainfall deficit.In Uttarakhand, heavy rainfall has triggered landslides along the Yamunotri National Highway, blocking sections of the road and damaging essential infrastructure. Superintendent of police Sarita Dobhal visited the landslide zones and reviewed safety protocols.The Barkot-Yamunotri road, severely damaged after a cloudburst near Barkot, was partially repaired. The incident killed two workers and left seven others missing. The Char Dham Yatra, which was briefly suspended due to weather warnings, has now resumed.Electricity and water supply were affected in areas of Tehri Garhwal, including Agrakhaal, Chamba, and Jakhindhar.In Jammu & Kashmir, the Chenab River continues to swell due to relentless rainfall over the past week, forcing authorities to open multiple spillway gates of the Salal Dam in Reasi. Local residents in low-lying areas like Talwada, Chinka, and Jendi have been advised to move to higher ground and avoid riverbanks.River rafting has been suspended, and NHPC teams, along with local officials, are on round-the-clock patrols.DIG Shridhar Patil of the Doda-Kishtwar-Ramban Range acknowledged the risk. ""All of you must have noticed that the water level has risen in the Chenab River. One incident has also come to our notice in the Doda district, in which some people have lost their lives.

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi is now on a four-day trip to Bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties, which come at a time when China continues to strengthen its military infrastructure in the Doklam plateau that saw a 73-day face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in 2017.The Army chief will call on Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and hold wide-ranging talks with Lt General Batoo Tshering, the chief operations officer of the Royal Bhutan Army, during the visit.Gen Dwivedi will also interact with senior officials of the Indian embassy, the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) stationed in the country, and Project Dantak of the Border Roads Organisation, which is engaged in the construction of roads and other developmental work there.“The visit reflects the deep-rooted and time-tested ties between India and Bhutan and reaffirms India’s commitment to a close and trusted partner,” Army spokesperson Colonel Nishant Arvind said.India has been keeping a close watch on the series of border talks between Bhutan and an expansionist China in a bid to resolve their territorial disputes, which include the Doklam plateau in the west and the Jakarlung and Pasamlung valleys in the north.Ever since India’s military confrontation with China in April 2020, after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh, the Indian Army has also been shoring up defenses in the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor, or `Chicken’s Neck,’ the narrow strip of land in north Bengal that connects the northeast with the rest of India.The PLA has steadily stepped up its activities and infrastructure development in the Bhutanese territory of Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, which witnessed the 73-day face-off between the rival troops in 2017.Indian troops had then blocked PLA attempts to extend their motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA has constructed a lot of military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam, as reported by TOI earlier.",General Upendra Dwivedi is on a four-day trip to Bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties.

It will happen over a period of a month or month-and-a-half, during which he will be meeting party legislators, MPs, defeated candidates, District Congress Committee chiefs, before meeting ministers, chief minister and deputy chief minister, he said.As part of the first phase of his three day visit, Surjewala on Monday held one-on-one meetings with legislators from the Chikkaballapura and Kolar districts, News agency PTI reported citing sources.He is expected to have heard their grievances and collected feedback on the government's functioning, they added.This comes a day after Congress MLA HA Iqbal Hussain renewed speculation about a major political development in Karnataka after claiming that DK Shivakumar can get the chief minister post within the next two or three months.""You all know what our (Congress's) strength was before this government came to power. Everyone knows who put in the struggle, sweat, effort and interest to achieve this victory. His (Shivakumar's) strategy and programmes are history now,"" Hussain said.""I don't believe in speculation. We have full confidence that the high command is aware of the situation and will take an appropriate decision at the right time to give him an opportunity,"" he added.He claimed that the big decision will be made within two to three months, when asked if Shivakumar will get the position this year.""Yes, I'm saying it. The date some leaders are hinting at for revolutionary political developments after September—this is what they are talking about. A decision will be made within two to three months,"" Hussain said.""That's what I'm saying. I'm not beating around the bush; I’m speaking directly,"" he added.However, when asked about Siddaramaiah's son and MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah brushing off the leadership change as mere speculation, Hussain said that the Congress high command had decided on government formation after the 2023 assembly polls.""We were all together in Delhi then. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Mallikarjun Kharge made the decision. Everyone knows that. They will take the next decision too—we'll have to wait and watch,"" he said.Earlier, cooperation minister KN Rajanna also hinted at ""revolutionary"" political developments after September.","Mallikarjun Kharge hints at possible leadership change in Karnataka government.

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, Railways will soon prepare reservation chart (of confirmed berths/seats) eight hours before scheduled departure of trains instead of the present four hours. To facilitate passenger convenience, for trains departing before 2pm, the reservation chart will be prepared at 9pm the previous evening.Railway Board proposed the changes last week and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed their implementation ""in a phased manner so that there is no disruption"". The board will come up with the roll out plan soon.In an official statement, the ministry said the current practice of preparing reservation charts four hours before train departure creates uncertainty in the minds of passengers. The new timeline will greatly help them with waitlisted tickets. They will get the first update on waitlist status well in advance. It will especially benefit passengers travelling from remote locations or suburbs of major cities to catch long distance trains. It will also provide more time to make alternative arrangements in case the waitlisted ticket is not confirmed, the statement said.In another passenger-friendly move, the railways announced complete revamp of passenger reservation system (PRS) by Dec.The new PRS will allow over 1.5 lakh ticket bookings per minute, around five times more than the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.Under the new PRS, ticket inquiry capacity will increase 10-fold - from 4 lakh to over 40 lakh enquiries per minute. The system will also have a multilingual and user-friendly booking and inquiry interface. The decisions were made at a review meeting chaired by Vaishnaw last week. Officials said the project has been under execution by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) over the last few months.""In the new PRS, users will be able to submit their choice of seat and see the fare calendar,"" said an official.

The system is seen as a vital step in bolstering India’s layered air defence capabilities.The Indian Air Force is seeking approval to procure three Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance (I-STAR) aircraft. These planes will be sourced from international manufacturers and later modified by DRDO’s Centre for Airborne Systems, in collaboration with private sector partners. The aircraft will enhance battlefield awareness and precision strike capability.The Indian Navy has proposed induction of pressure-based moored mines developed by DRDO, aimed at countering enemy submarines and surface ships in strategic waters.The plan to modernise 84 Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets, already approved in principle, is expected to come up for further consideration. The upgrade will include avionics, weapons systems, and electronic warfare capabilities.The Navy is also pushing for unmanned underwater drones to strengthen undersea warfare and surveillance capabilities.The meeting marks the first major DAC session since the launch of Operation Sindoor, India’s counter-terror and strategic surveillance initiative, and underscores the government’s urgency in enhancing its defence posture amid evolving security challenges.Once cleared, the acquisitions are expected to significantly boost India’s operational readiness and reflect a continued emphasis on both indigenisation and technological upgrades in defence.","The defence acquisition council (DAC) is poised to clear a massive set of proposals worth over Rs 1 lakh crore aimed at modernising India's armed forces.

There is no hike in fares for trains on the suburban rail network and monthly season tickets for both suburban and non-suburban trains. Similarly, there is no increase in fares for passengers travelling in second class on ordinary (non-mail or express) trains for distances up to 500km.

CEC allays oppn fears of Bihar 'disenfranchisement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-allays-oppn-fears-of-bihar-disenfranchisement/articleshow/122169585.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Monday stepped forward to allay the opposition's fears regarding ""disenfranchisement"" on account of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying the objective of the exercise is to simply ensure that no eligible voter is left out, while also keeping the roll free of any ineligible voter.This is in line with the duty cast upon the Election Commission by Article 326 of the Constitution, which requires only an Indian citizen above 18 years of age and ordinary resident in that constituency, unless disqualified, to be enrolled. Kumar told TOI EC is deploying over 1 lakh volunteers to assist the elderly, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and other marginalised groups in filling up their enumeration forms.In a statement on Monday, EC reiterated that over 4.9 crore electors included in Bihar's electoral roll from 2003 - when the last such intensive revision was conducted - need not submit any document other than their filled-up enumeration form. The 2003 roll will be treated as probative evidence of eligibility, including presumption of Indian citizenship unless any input is received otherwise.They only need to verify details from the 2003 roll - now uploaded on the EC website and hard copies of which are being provided to booth level officers (BLOs) - and return the filled-up enumeration form to the BLO.Even children of these 4.9 crore electors will only have to submit their own citizenship proof from a list of 11 specified documents, and not any documents related to the birth of their parents. ""This is because any children born to parents included as electors in the 2003 Bihar roll are Indian citizens by birth,"" said an EC official. ""Thus, nearly 60% of Bihar's (current) 7.9 crore electorate, would not have to submit any documents. ""Stating that revision of electoral roll is mandatory prior to parliamentary/assembly election or bypoll, EC said it has been conducting annual summary revisions for 75 years. Nine intensive revisions were undertaken between 1952 and 2004, involving an average six-year gap, but the latest was pending for 22 years.""SIR is required as the electoral roll is dynamic and changes due to deaths, shifting of people due to reasons such as migration due to occupation/ education/ marriage, and addition of new voters who have turned 18 years old,"" said the officer.As per Census 2011, there were 454 million migrants in India, up from 315 million in 2001. Even as per the Migration in India Report, 2021, the percentage of migrants in the population was estimated at around 29%, which is more than the winning margin in many of the constituencies.""SIR will introduce complete transparency in the additions/deletions in the electoral rolls through active participation of booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties,"" the officer said, and added that around 1.5 lakh BLAs, including over 47,000 deployed by RJD alone, will monitor each stage of SIR. Interestingly, even as RJD is opposing SIR, its MLA from Hathua Rajesh Kushwaha has released posters educating electors on how to ensure they are enrolled.","Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar stepped forward to allay the opposition's fears regarding ""disenfranchisement"" on account of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll. Kumar told TOI EC is deploying over 1 lakh volunteers to assist the elderly, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and other marginalised groups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122169628,imgsize-1114599,width-400,resizemode-4/122169628.jpg"
"Aadhaar gaps, deviation from syllabus raise CUET concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aadhaar-gaps-deviation-from-syllabus-raise-cuet-concerns/articleshow/122169488.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even as CUET-UG 2025 results are awaited, the conduct of the exam has raised concerns over biometric verification gaps, shift-wise disparities and deviations from the syllabus. These have drawn criticism from candidates, parents, and experts, who say the exam fell short on basic fairness, syllabus integrity, and identity verification protocols.Adherence to protocols had been explicitly recommended by a govt-appointed high-level committee headed by former Isro chief K Radhakrishnan. One of the committee's core recommendations was multi-stage candidate verification, including Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, to prevent impersonation. National Testing Agency (NTA), in response to queries from TOI, accepted that biometric authentication of all candidates was not done at centre entry gates. Instead, the agency said, Aadhaar details were validated during online application process for 96% of the 13.54 lakh registered candidates, and that biometric data and photographs were captured inside exam halls due to time constraints between shifts.The agency said ""for CUET-UG 2025, Aadhaar validation was performed when candidate's name, date of birth, & gender matched during e-registration"".This indicates that photographs of candidates were not matched with Aadhaar data either at time of registration or during the exam, raising apprehensions of impersonation. This approach also resulted in a verification gap for the remaining 4% of candidates.Another concern is uneven shift-wise distribution of candidates, which could undermine percentile-based normalisation process. For instance, based on attendance documents accessed by TOI, physics paper had nearly 5,000 candidates in one shift and 570 in another, with similar variations seen in mathematics & general aptitude. While NTA did not provide subject and session-wise data, it said ""sample sizes were sufficiently large"" and cited the English test, for which around 43,000 candidates were accommodated in each shift.This raises a critical statistical issue: normalisation assumes comparable cohorts. If sample sizes differ across shifts, percentile rankings may not accurately reflect relative difficulty levels.On syllabus front, for physical education, the syllabus uploaded by NTA states candidates should, while naming their sport, opt for ""one of your choice"" for Unit 3. However, students reported that the questions were mandatory with no options available.While NTA maintains that CUET-UG 2025 was conducted ""successfully"" with approximately 78% attendance, several of these issues have cast doubt over the agency's capacity to uphold fairness, transparency, and comparability for the exam."," CUET-UG 2025 has raised concerns over biometric verification gaps, shift-wise disparities and deviations from the syllabus.

The idea of a two-and-a-half-year power-sharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar has gained traction, with Siddaramaiah completing half the term of govt in Nov.

National medical register struggles to get off the ground,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-medical-register-struggles-to-get-off-the-ground/articleshow/122169193.cms,"Another doctor's day comes by and we still do not have an updated medical registry where one can check the credentials of any doctor in India. After the spate of reports on fake doctors and those practicing without the requisite qualification or training, hospitals are struggling to verify the credentials of those they hire in the absence of a streamlined registry that reflects all the qualifications of a doctor and details of who have been blacklisted or penalised.Almost five years after National Medical Commission (NMC) was constituted, it has managed to verify only a few hundred out of the estimated 13 lakh plus doctors practicing in India.In a bid to get the register updated, the commission put out a notice in Sept last year asking all practising doctors to register again with National Medical Register. Just over 10,400 doctors' applications were received, of which barely 140 were approved or verified at the beginning of May this year. Though govt claimed that ""the speedy and easy registration process on the portal will facilitate the timely updation of the data"", in reality, doctors have been facing several problems with registration.""I registered on the portal on Aug 2024, a day after it was opened. Kerala State medical council approved and confirmed my registration to NMC. Yet, my application has been returned with irrelevant queries four times, which include queries on change in the names of the University and state medical council.They have asked me to file an affidavit regarding the name in Aadhaar card not matching the existing registration, which predates Aadhaar. Even today, my registration is not done,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and an RTI activist whose RTI application revealed how slowly the registration process is happening.""Is there a comprehensive list of doctors who have been blacklisted over the years or those who have been penalised for some wrongdoing? Where can I find such a list? Without that, how do we do a background check on doctors we hire?"" asked a doctor responsible for recruitment of doctors for a hospital.Many specialists are surprised by number of doctors without the requisite specialisation practicing a specialty and claiming to be experts. In a recent example, Delhi branch of Indian Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists and Leprologists was unable to verify if a life member of the association was a genuine dermatologist with a valid MBBS degree and specialisation in dermatology.Health minister JP Nadda had claimed that the register would ""strengthen the digital healthcare ecosystem"" and that there would soon be ""a similar register for paramedics and other healthcare professionals"". Yet, health ministry has not been able to provide accurate data in Parliament on how many doctors of modern medicine are currently practising.","Almost five years after National Medical Commission was constituted, it has managed to verify only a few hundred out of the estimated 13 lakh plus doctors practicing in India.

SC flags large-scale fake certificate fraud in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-flags-large-scale-fake-certificate-fraud-in-up/articleshow/122169070.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over large-scale fraud of educational certificates in UP and getting jobs on that basis, SC on Monday said that stern action needed to be taken against them and asked a teacher from the state to bring evidence to prove that his certificate is equivalent to BEd to be eligible for the post.The teacher, who has been serving for the last 32 years, moved the court through his lawyer Gaurav Dhingra after his job was terminated on the ground that he was not qualified for the post. His plea against termination was rejected by Allahabad HC.Senior advocate M C Dhingra, appearing for the teacher, submitted that he was holding the degree of 'Shiksha Alankar' which was recognised as BEd at that time when he joined the service in 1991 and the qualification was derecognised in 1997 when he has already worked for seven years. He said that the decision could not be implemented retrospectively.Hearing his plea, a bench of Justices Manoj Misra and N K Singh asked the petitioner to show that his degree of Shiksha Alankar was equivalent to BEd to save his job. ""...I come from the same state and I know the ground situation.There is large-scale fraud in UP of fake certificate. Recently 8,000 certificates of Agra University were found to be fake. It is because of this such order (for termination of job) is being passed,"" Justice Misra said.The petitioner pleaded the court to issue notice to state govt and seek response from it on whether degree of Shiksha Alankar was equivalent to BEd but the bench refused.

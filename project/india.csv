The Congerss leader's post on X

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would ""meekly bow"" to US President Donald Trump , as New Delhi weighs its interests amid ongoing trade talks with Washington.Gandhi's remark was a reaction to Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal 's statement, where he said: ""We are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest"". Trump has set July 9 as the deadline for trade agreements.""Piyush Goyal can beat his chest all he wants, mark my words, Modi will meekly bow to the Trump tariff deadline,"" Gandhi wrote on X.India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.Trump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on nearly 100 countries but agreed to a 90-day pause that is to end Tuesday. India was slapped with 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs.There is uncertainty over whether India and US can agree to an early tranche or a mini deal before that even as a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement is negotiated by Fall (Sept-Oct) after a meeting between Trump and PM Modi. For India, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as maize and soybean, as well as dairy products is a concern.While Goyal did not get into the specifics, he said India will not compromise the interests of farm and dairy sectors.""Farmers' interest is always paramount for Modi government. In any negotiation we have done, you have seen UK, Australia, Mauritius, EFTA and UAE agreements, India's farmers have been protected.""The government has refrained from offering concessions in major agricultural products, but for US, it is the main focus. While some government officials said US demands were not very clear, for India, Goyal said Indian expectations for duty concessions in labour-intensive sectors were the focus of the trade deal. India was hoping for duty concessions in leather, footwear, textiles and some auto parts in return for reducing levies on automobiles and American whiskey.","Gandhi's remark was a reaction to Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal's statement. Goyal said: ""We are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest"" Trump has set July 9 as the deadline for trade agreements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122261216,imgsize-44074,width-400,resizemode-4/122261216.jpg"
SC to decide validity of Madras HC stay on Tamil Nadu law on University VC appointments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-decide-validity-of-madras-hc-stay-on-tamil-nadu-law-on-university-vc-appointments/articleshow/122260745.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday entertained Tamil Nadu’s petition questioning reasonableness of Madras HC’s order staying its legislation, which gave the state government, instead of the governor, the power to appoint University vice-chancellors, but refused M K Stalin government’s plea for suspending the HC order to re-operationalize the law.TN fielded a team of senior advocates – A M Singhvi, Rakesh Dwivedi and P Wilson – to argue that the HC had without considering the urgency to appoint vice-chancellors to universities, recommendations to which effect has been put in cold-storage by the Governor, stayed the legislation.The law giving state govt the power to appoint VCs to universities was stayed along with nine other laws, Bills for which were reserved for the President’s consideration by the governor but were regarded as deemed to have been approved by President in a controversial unprecedented ruling by a two-judge SC bench on Apr 8.Three days after the ‘deemed to have been approved’ ruling by the SC, which now is subject to a Constitution bench’s opinion on a Presidential Reference questioning the use of Article 142 power of the SC to virtually obliterate roles assigned by the Constitution to President and Governors on Bills passed by Assemblies, the TN govt had notified the nine bills as laws.The bench refused to stay the HC order but asked the UGC and the public interest litigation petitioner before the HC to respond to TN’s petition in four weeks.For UGC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the law is palpably contrary to the UGC Regulations which empower only governors to appoint VCs to the universities.When the senior advocates pleaded that they would argue before the HC for vacation of the stay, Mehta said that in that case the TN must withdraw its petition seeking transfer of the PIL from Madras HC to the SC. “The state cannot have both options open at the same time and be permitted to argue before the HC that the SC is considering transfer of the PIL to itself,” he said.Wilson sought expunging of certain ‘harsh remarks’ against him by the HC merely because he was pointing out the SC’s 2-J bench order. Justices Narasimha and Mahadevan said this request would be considered by the SC during the final hearing on the TN’s petition.One of the Acts, notified on Apr 11 by the state related to vesting in the state govt the powers of the Governor, as Chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors of universities in the state. A vacation bench of the HC on May 21 granted stay on this amending provision, holding that UGC Regulations, 2018, would prevail over the state legislation by virtue of doctrine of repugnancy.The state said it had raised the objection to the delay in filing of the PIL but the division bench of the HC “did not even call for an explanation from the Registry of the HC or the Petitioner but proceeded to hear the case in a tearing hurry.” The HC “showed undue haste”, did not even give a week’s time to the state to file its counter affidavit, and passed the stay order “for extraneous reasons”, it said, adding that the impugned order is replete with personal attacks on the senior counsel who appeared for the state.","The Supreme Court on Friday entertained Tamil Nadu’s petition questioning reasonableness of Madras HC's order staying its legislation.

When Raj meets Uddhav (again): Thackerays to hold joint 'victory' rally today; reunite over Hindi 'imposition',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-raj-meets-uddhav-again-thackerays-to-hold-joint-victory-rally-today-reunite-over-hindi-imposition/articleshow/122260461.cms,"Raj Thackeray (left), and Uddhav Thackeray.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in 20 years, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray will share the stage on Saturday. The two leaders will address a joint ""victory"" rally organised by their parties to mark the withdrawal of government resolutions (GRs) related to the three-language policy.The rally is being held at the NSCI Dome in central Mumbai's Worli, which falls in the assembly constituency of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray. The gathering is also seen as significant ahead of the upcoming local body elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.Uddhav and Raj Thackeray, whose parties have been vocal on the issues of Marathi language and identity, last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign. That was after former chief minister Narayan Rane had left the undivided Shiv Sena. Raj Thackeray quit the party later that year and launched the MNS in 2006.The rally comes in the backdrop of protests against the April 16 GR issued by the BJP-led Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, which made Hindi a compulsory third language for students from Classes 1 to 5 in English and Marathi medium schools. Following backlash, the government amended the GR on June 17, making Hindi optional.On June 29, the cabinet decided to withdraw both GRs entirely.On the same day, leaders from Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had burnt copies of the GRs and had planned a protest march for July 5. After the rollback, both parties decided to hold a joint ""victory"" event instead. Uddhav and Raj had then said the government blinked after witnessing the unity of Maharashtrians and did not want them to come together.Though the two parties have chosen not to display any party flags, symbols, hoardings or scarves during the event, the political significance of the rally is being seen in the backdrop of their recent electoral performance. In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20 seats while the MNS failed to win any.The parties have invited other political groups that opposed the GRs, as well as members of the literary and art community, to take part in the rally.The Congress, a partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Shiv Sena (UBT), has however said it will not attend the event. State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal said the party supports the stand against making Hindi mandatory but will not join the rally.NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) president Sharad Pawar also said in Pune on Thursday that he would not be attending due to prior commitments. However, NCP (SP) state president Jayant Patil said the party would be represented either by working president Supriya Sule or MLA Jitendra Awhad. Patil said MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar had personally invited the NCP (SP).The rally takes place amid recent incidents involving both parties. MNS activists were seen on camera assaulting a food stall owner for not speaking Marathi. In another case, two people were made to apologise to a man in front of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Rajan Vichare for allegedly attacking him. “Speak in Marathi since you have hit a Marathi person,” a voice is heard telling one of the two men while he tries to say something to Vichare, a former MP from Thane.","Uddhav and Raj Thackeray last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led a delegation of the opposition INDIA bloc to meet Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) on Friday, lodging strong objections to the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral roll.The opposition claimed the Election Commission’s current exercise is “impractical and anti-democratic”. They demanded the inclusion of Aadhaar card , ration card and MGNREGA card as valid documents for voter verification under the SIR process in Bihar.Sharing a personal experience with reporters after the meeting, Tejashwi said, “My wife’s voter ID card was made on the basis of aadhaar card. Why is the aadhaar card excluded from the list of documents required for the SIR in Bihar?” he asked.EC officials here in Delhi clarified that the Aadhaar card was kept out of the list of 11 specified documents for SIR, as Aadhaar is neither a proof of date or place of birth, nor of one's Indian citizenship. ""It just defines that the 10-fingerprints, photo and iris belong to the person in whose name the card is issued. In fact, every Aadhaar card mentions in bold that ""Aadhaar is a proof of identity and not of one's citizenship or date of birth"".EC officials also mentioned that the Trinamool Congress, in its interactions with the commission, has consistently and strongly opposed linking EPIC with Aadhaar.Tejashwi also questioned the short 25-day window to verify 8 crore voters. ""Around 4 crore voters from Bihar live outside the state. How can they return so soon to verify their bona fides?” he asked.The RJD delegation that called on the Bihar CEO comprised state president Manganilal Mandal, MPs Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, former minister Alok Kumar Mehta, state spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan, Congress state president Rajesh Ram, legislative party leader Shakeel Ahmed, Sanjay Pandey, VIP’s Mukesh Sahani, CPI-ML’s Kumar Parvez, CPI’s Ram Naresh Pandey and CPI-M’s Lalan Chaudhary.","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led a delegation of the opposition INDIA bloc to meet Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Booth level officers (BLOs) on Friday completed door-to-door visits to the state’s nearly 1.5 crore households as part of the ongoing special intensive roll revision (SIR), distributing enumeration forms to over 87 per cent or over 6.8 crore, of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate. Already, 38 lakh or 5 per cent filled-up and signed enumeration forms, with or without the specified documents, have been received by the BLOs, with the figure expected to touch 15 per cent on Saturday.Sources in the election commission (EC) told TOI that even where enumeration forms are short on one or more required documents, there shall be a window for the elector concerned to submit them anytime before July 25, the last date for submission of the completed enumeration forms. “All those who turn in their filled-up forms by July 25 will be included in the draft electoral roll to be published on August 1, 2025,” said an EC official adding that the BLOs are working with the motto “inclusion first”.“In order to get one’s name in the draft electoral roll, the strict condition is to sign and submit the pre-printed enumeration form before July 25. This step will filter out non-existent voters, either dead or migrated ones who are no longer ordinary residents of that assembly constituency,” said an EC officer.Though BLOs will give their recommendation while submitting/uploading the filled up enumeration form, the electoral registration officer (ERO) or assistant ERO (AERO) is expected to scrutinise the forms “not recommended” by BLOs only after draft rolls are published on August 1.Claims and objections to the draft electoral roll can be filed from August 1 to September 1. “Based on the documents attached or not attached, eligibility verification of each name in the draft roll will start vigorously from August 2 onwards, which is also the date from which political parties or any member of the public can file claims and objections,” said an officer.EROs and AEROs will scrutinise the forms against the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 326, which requires electors to Indian citizens, not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in the constituency.Asked about the remaining 13 per cent enumeration forms still not distributed by BLOs, EC said these could be on account of locked houses, dead electors, migrants or those who may be travelling. BLO will be making two more house visits in such cases.Electors who miss the July 25 deadline can still apply for inclusion during the claims and objections period using Form 6. The over 1.5 lakh booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties, including 52,689 by the BJP 47,504 by RJD, 34,660 by JD(U) and 16,500 by the Congress, can continue to submit up to 10 forms per day even after the draft roll is published.The final electoral roll will be published on September 30, 2025. Those still aggrieved can file first appeal with the district magistrate and final one with the chief electoral officer.Further additions to the electoral roll can be made even after the Bihar poll is announced, that is, till the last day of filing of nominations.","Booth level officers (BLOs) on Friday completed door-to-door visits to the state’s nearly 1.5 crore households.

It also has significant conventional oil and gas deposits, positioning it as a potential long-term energy partner for India.The country is also rich in critical minerals such as lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. These are important for India’s plans for clean energy and industrial growth. Along with Bolivia and Chile, Argentina is part of the Lithium Triangle, a region that holds a large share of the world’s lithium reserves.Lithium plays a central role in rechargeable batteries, which are used in electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, and systems that store renewable energy.Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with Argentina's President Javier Milei to explore cooperation in areas like defence, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, renewable energy, trade and investment.""We will focus on advancing our mutually beneficial cooperation, including in the areas of agriculture, critical minerals, energy, trade, tourism, technology, and investment,"" Modi had said.PM Modi will also visit the famous Boca Juniors Stadium to have a look at Argentine football, news agency ANI reported.

Despite global challenges, commerce & industry minister

Piyush Goyal

expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by FTAs. While remaining upbeat on growth, he tells

Sidhartha

that investment is flowing into several sectors. He is pushing for a review of FTAs with

Asean

and Japan and is cautious on China. Excerpts:

How much export growth is expected this year given the global uncertainty?

How much help will come from FTAs?

The Modi govt opted out of RCEP. In hindsight, was it a sensible thing to do since many experts still argue that India should have joined it?

The Asean FTA is under review. Are you satisfied with the pace or is there a sense of frustration?

Your recent comments on the Asean agreement stirred a controversy. Do you see Chinese goods and investments getting routed through some of the countries that are part of the bloc?

Does the focus on China+1 remain in the US?

Are there opportunities for India?

Despite the focus on reducing imports from China, the trade deficit is near $100 billion. What is being done to check that?

Is there a reluctance to allow Indian goods in China?

Are the conditions conducive to lifting some of the checks?

There are indications of a slowdown in the first quarter. As the minister in-charge of industry, what will be your strategy to accelerate growth in the industrial sector?

Weak capex by the private sector is a major concern. When do you see an improvement in investments?

While gross FDI inflows have grown, there was an increase in remittances and outward FDI last year. How will you step up overall FDI flows?

What changes are you planning on SEZ regulations?

Quality control orders have been a focus. What is the rationale and benefit when a section of industry is objecting to them?

How is the progress on industrial corridors and when will you be ready with the plan for 100 industrial parks?

In the last 11 years of Modi govt, India has navigated uncertainty and volatility quite well. Total exports soared to a record $825 billion in 2024-25, growing over 6%, and sustaining a robust 5.8% CAGR over the past decade. We have seen a remarkable 20% CAGR during the past decade in electronics, and traditional sectors such as engineering and pharmaceuticals have done well. From 2019-20 to 2024-25, goods exports have seen a CAGR of 6.9%, despite the Covid period. From 2019 to 2023, because country-wise data is available up to 2023, commercial services exports registered a CAGR of 12%. Going forward, we may be able to maintain 5-6% growth in goods, especially non-petroleum exports, while services may grow 9-10%. If we can achieve that we are looking at crossing $870 billion in the current year, despite the global problems. Our focus is more and more on value-added and labour-intensive goods and services exports.India has deepened its footprint with FTAs with the UAE, Australia, EFTA and the UK, reshaping our trade dynamics. FTAs do make an impact. With the UAE, services exports have almost doubled in the last four-five years.In Australia, it has nearly tripled. On the goods side too we have grown very well, in Australia’s case at 25%, we have crossed $8 billion, while we were tottering at $3 billion earlier. The same is not true of the ones signed during UPA. Services export to Japan is slowing down. We did not get very wide coverage in areas of interest for India. It’s a sad situation and I hope that our efforts for a review will bear fruit. Japan has not agreed to it and a South Korea review is underway. Now, we sign FTAs after extensive stakeholder consultation and for the Modi govt, national interest is paramount.Before the decision, we held 200 consultations with stakeholders on RCEP and the benefits of joining it, only three suggested we should join. PM Modi showed decisive leadership and sensitivities for our fishermen, farmers, industry and entrepreneurs. He recognised that it was nothing but FTA between India and China because we had agreements with the others. We have signed ECTA with Australia and we should be able to finalise an agreement with New Zealand in the next few months. Just this week at a meeting with exporters, the issue came up and not one of them suggested that we should join.We can do much better and I am hopeful that both Korea and Asean will recognise the asymmetries in the FTAs signed 15 years ago and will make them more contemporary, fair, balanced and equitable.When the US announced its agreement with Vietnam, it focused on transshipment of goods from other countries. Every day we get cases of sub-standard goods coming in, predatory pricing being deployed for exports and to kill Indian industry. We are working on strengthening Make in India, supporting Indian industry wherever it is hurt by predaTOI tory pricing and focusing on Quality Control Orders.It appears to be working on a two-pronged strategy. While recognising that it cannot decouple completely from China, it is also working on strengthening the supply chain.Clearly, India is a much sought after destination for investments, there are collaborations for technology. In the maritime sector, India is recognised as a shipbuilding destination and govt is also coming up with measures to support it. Semiconductors is a success story of the Modi govt. We have seen significant increase in domestic value addition in the sectors where we offered PLI.During the 10 years of UPA, India’s trade deficit with China grew nearly 25 times, but has expanded 1.75 times between 2014-15 and 202324. We have managed to bring some reasonable controls. Electrical equipment, machinery, organic chemicals and plastics are our major imports. Between 2019-20 and 2023-24, there has been an increase in import of these items from China, but there is also a corresponding increase in exports, showing that several items imported from China are raw material, inputs or capital goods used for making finished products in India.There are several non-tariff barriers, including language and procedural delays. Many industries just don’t buy from India even when our products are competitive. Getting more market access is an area in which we are working with China through our embassy.Periodically, China has erected restrictions, whether it is export of rare earth magnets, fertilizer or tunnel boring machines, and recently recalled engineers. Yet, there are demands from Indian industry to lift some of the checks on investment from China, on visas and on apps.Given that there is now engagement with China at the ministerial level, if China is willing to engage on fair terms on trade, India will be willing to talks and see how we can work towards a more mutually beneficial and a fair trading system.Time will tell.We are already seeing an uptick and rural demand has shown significant improvement. You may see a jump in growth in the second half of the year. I see no difficulty in closing the year with RBI’s 6.5% growth which will make us the fastest growing economy.It varies across sectors. There is a lot of interest in investments in sectors that have domestic demand and there is import substitution, such as steel. There are plans to invest Rs 20 lakh crore in 10 years; cement is an ever-green sector as demand and production grow every year. Auto parts, sanitaryware are seeing large investments and there is confidence that Indian companies can compete with anyone. There are some focus areas like white goods, where demand is growing very fast on the back of tax cuts, growing income levels and the finance minister also spoke of GST reduction recently. Auto sector is growing rapidly and our efforts in electronics are showing results. Some of the investment going into GCCs may not be fully captured.With the outflow of investment, India is also building an asset base and its own presence in different sectors across the world, which in the long run will be our strength.There are certain suggestions that will help SEZ units increase their capacity utilisation and help meet the demand that is currently being serviced by some of the FTA countries. We are working with the requisite departments, and we should be able to come up with the changes by the end of the year.We are emphasising on QCOs to implement the PM’s vision of zero defect-zero effect manufacturing. Technical regulations have been strengthened to promote a strong quality ecosystem in India, enhance product safety for consumers, prevent the import of substandard goods, protect the environment and attract investment. It acts as a nudge to produce quality products in India.In Dholera, Shendra-Bidkin, Greater Noida and Vikram Udyogpuri, over 4,200 acres have been allotted and 76% of the developed industrial land is now under committed use. Each city is emerging as an industrial powerhouse: Dholera has emerged as the future semicon city of India, ShendraBidkin in Maharashtra is evolving into an automotive and EV hub. Of the 12 new projects approved by the govt last Aug, tenders have been floated and our target is to get the ground activity started by OctNov. As for the industrial parks, the blueprint is at an advanced stage. They are proposed to be developed and implemented through independent special purpose vehicles in collaboration between the Centre, states and wherever applicable, private players. There will be a single window system for approvals and plug-and-play infrastructure will be maintained."," commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by FTAs.

CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

Poll Do you believe that the police response to such incidents is swift and adequate? Yes, they handle it well. No, they could do better.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





PUNE: A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.""He also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,"" deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ""We have seen the cropped selfie image and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting the gadget from her,"" he said.The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar and has been staying with her younger brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI. The society is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into ‘A', ‘B' and ‘C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents.The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone in the flat when the ""delivery agent"" came calling, police said.DCP Shinde said: ""The woman said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying, and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment to step in and bolted the door from inside before using the spray on her face. ""He said: ""The woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams from the Kondhwa police and the city crime branch have been deployed to work on leads to arrest the culprit. ""Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said.""We have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,"" said an officer, who is part of the probe.

We have provided all details of the cellphone application and CCTV footage to the police. ""The office-bearer added: ""Only one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat.

NEW DELHI: In a horrific double murder, a 24-year-old worker in a garment shop entered the Lajpat Nagar residence of his employer and slit the throats of his wife and teenage son on Wednesday evening.

However, police said they were yet to ascertain the motive and would interrogate him after he arrived in Delhi late on Thursday.The victims were identified as Ruchika Sewani (42) and her son Krish (14). The family lived in F block, Lajpat Nagar, and ran a garment business from an establishment in the same locality. The murders took place around 7.30pm and were discovered over two hours later.Police received a PCR call at 9.43pm on Wednesday from Kuldeep Sewani (44), saying his wife Ruchika and son Krish were not responding to calls.Arnab (22), a neighbour of the Sewanis, said the worker sent by Kuldeep to the house had called back with grim news.""The worker saw bloodstains at the gate and on the stairs, and informed Kuldeep that the phone was ringing inside the house. Kuldeep rushed home and kept knocking on our door.

They had been attacked with a sharp object and had deep neck injuries.He added that the incident came to light around 9.30pm. Due to the sound of their air conditioner, no one had heard anything unusual during the assault.Police began reviewing CCTV footage from the area. In one of the cameras, they spotted Mukesh coming out of the building. This raised suspicion and police sent out an inter-state alert. Soon, Mukesh was apprehended by UP police at Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction while attempting to flee on a train.Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) Hemant Tiwari said a murder case was registered. According to police sources, the accused claimed he took a Rs 45,000 advance due to financial need. Ruchika gave him the money but he started taking leaves and stopped answering her calls.

However, he flew into a rage over a woman having scolded him.The source said he went to Ruchika's house, which was on the ground floor, and rang the bell. She let him in thinking he had come to talk about why he wasn't coming to the shop. ""He gave her no chance and started attacking her with a sharp object,"" the source added.Hearing his mother's scream, the son, who had returned from cricket coaching session, tried to save her but was also attacked.

NEW DELHI: Following remarks by union minister Kiren Rijiju backing the Dalai Lama’s announcement about his succession plan, including the statement that China will have no role in it, India said Friday that it has taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.Interestingly, the Chinese foreign ministry after cautioning India at a media briefing, according to agency reports from Beijing, against interfering in Tibetan affairs at the expense of Sino-India ties, omitted its comments objecting to Rijiju’s remarks from the official transcript of the briefing.“We have seen reports relating to the statement made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama about the continuation of the Dalai Lama institution. Government of India does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, responding to media queries on the Dalai Lama’s announcement. He added that the Indian government has always upheld freedom of religion for all in India and will continue to do so.India’s ties with China have shown signs of improvement in the past 9 months, since they resolved the almost 5-year-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh, leading to resumption of high-level bilateral visits.Amid global uncertainties, both sides seem keen to maintain a steady working relationship. External affairs minister S Jaishankar is likely to visit China on July 13 for a meeting of the SCO foreign ministers for what will be the first bilateral visit by the foreign minister of either country since early 2022 when Wang Yi visited India. Jaishankar has not visited China since the Covid outbreak and the beginning of the military standoff in 2020.Defence minister Rajnath Singh too visited China last month for a meeting of the SCO defence ministers. NSA Ajit Doval has twice visited China since PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping last year in October on the margins of the BRICS summit in Russia. As Special Representative for boundary talks, Wang himself is likely to visit India this month for talks with Doval. India, however, is yet to confirm PM Narendra Modi’s participation in the SCO summit in China in September.Unlike the US, which officially maintains that China has no role to play in the Dalai Lama’s succession, India has never taken any position on the issue. China maintains that the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama can only be appointed through the “traditional” process that includes approval by the central government. In rare remarks by an Indian minister, Rijiju had backed the spiritual leader’s assertion that no one else other than his Trust will help choose his successor. Rijiju clarified on Friday that he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the Indian government but, as a devotee himself, expressing the perspective of the Dalai Lama’s followers.“All over the world, the people who follow Buddhism and who believe in the sacred, supreme Dalai Lama ji…it is everyone’s wish that the Dalai Lama ji himself will decide. There is no need for the Government of India or for me to say anything…I am speaking as a follower. I am a devotee. This is the wish of the followers. I am not saying anything on behalf of the government of India or on the Chinese government’s statement,” said the minister.",India said it has taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.

In a new twist to the Pune rape case involving a 22-year-old IT professional, police now say the alleged attacker was not a stranger but someone known to the woman. According to investigators, the selfie used as evidence was taken by the woman herself and later edited, while the threatening message found on her phone was also typed by her, news agency PTI reported.“They know each other for a couple of years and belong to the same community. The selfie was taken by the woman herself, and she also typed the purported threatening message,” Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar told reporters on Friday, as reported by PTI.Earlier, the woman had claimed that an unknown man posing as a courier delivery agent entered her flat in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, bolted the door, and had allegedly raped her after spraying a chemical that caused her to pass out. She later said the attacker left behind a threatening note and a selfie taken using her mobile phone, partially showing his face.However, after detaining the suspect—described as a highly qualified professional—police said the original image had clearly shown the man’s full face but was later edited. Commissioner Kumar added, “No chemical spray was used. The girl’s mental state is not good at present. The rape part is still under investigation.”The woman had initially told police that the man entered her home by claiming he had a parcel from a bank, then asked for a pen. When she turned her back, he entered, latched the door, and assaulted her. She claimed to have passed out and regained consciousness around 8.30 pm, after which she called her relatives, and the police were alerted.The original case, registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation), had triggered a swift police response. Forensic experts were brought in to examine her and collect samples. CCTV footage from the housing society showed no trace of the alleged courier agent, and no visitor entries had been logged in the app-based system used by the society.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde had said, “We have seen the cropped selfie and the message on the survivor’s phone after collecting the gadget from her.”The woman, who works with an IT company in Kalyaninagar, had been living with her younger brother in a rented flat since 2022.

No compromise on interests of farm & dairy sectors: Goyal

NEW DELHI: India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.""India has never discussed any trade agreement or even a tranche under any time pressure or under any duress. We have to take care of our national interest, we have to ensure it's a fair deal which gives us a sustained preferential advantage over our competitors... But we are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest,"" he told TOI in an interview, referring to the July 9 deadline set by US President Trump for trade agreements.US President Donald Trump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on nearly 100 countries but agreed to a 90-day pause that is to end Tuesday. India was slapped with 26% reciprocal tariffs. There is uncertainty over whether India and US can agree to an early tranche or a mini deal before that even as a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement is negotiated by Fall (Sept-Oct) after a meeting between Trump and PM Modi.For India, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as maize and soybean, as well as dairy products is a concern.While commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal did not get into the specifics, he said India will not compromise the interests of farm and dairy sectors. ""Farmers' interest is always paramount for Modi govt. In any negotiation we have done, you have seen UK, Australia, Mauritius, EFTA and UAE agreements, India's farmers have been protected. "" Govt has refrained from offering concessions in major agricultural products, but for US, it is the main focus.While some govt officials said US demands were not very clear, for India, Goyal said Indian expectations for duty concessions in labour-intensive sectors were the focus of the trade deal. India was hoping for duty concessions in leather, footwear, textiles and some auto parts in return for reducing levies on automobiles and American whiskey.Besides, India wants to be insulated from future tariff adjustments, including sectoral actions, while getting the benefit of lower duties compared to countries such as China and Vietnam. There are only a handful of countries, including UK, China and Vietnam, that have so far agreed to trade deals with US.",Piyush Goyal says India will not compromise on interests of farm & dairy sectors.

""This is no surprise because 81% of military hardware that Pakistan is getting is all Chinese. China, of course, (followed) the good old dictum, kill with a borrowed knife. .. So, he (sic) would rather use the neighbour to cause pain than get involved in the mudslinging match on the northern borders,"" he added.The deep Pakistan-China military collusiveness was reinforced during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10, with Islamabad using a wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, as reported by TOI earlier.Lt Gen Singh, on his part, said China was able to test its weapons against those used by India during the conflict. ""So, it's like a live lab available to them. It is something that we have to be very cognizant about,"" he said.""Turkiye also played an important role in providing the type of support it did,"" he added. Pakistan, for instance, extensively used Turkish-origin Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones during the conflict.The senior officer said crucial lessons among the multiple ones to be learned from Operation Sindoor include the need for an effective C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), a more robust air defence network and civil-military fusion.The candid remarks come after Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, speaking in Singapore on May 31, downplayed China's role in the conflict. While Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing, the CDS had said.Pointing to China using its extensive satellite network to monitor Indian military movements, Lt Gen Singh said, ""When the DGMO-level talks were on, Pakistan actually was mentioning that we know that your such and such vector is primed and ready for action, and we would request you to perhaps pull it back. So, he (sic) was getting live inputs from China."" Lt Gen Singh also pointed out Indian population centres were not quite at risk during Operation Sindoor. ""In the next round, we'll have to be prepared for that.""","India faced three adversaries on just one border during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan was being actively supported by China and Turkiye, a top Army officer said on Friday. Beijing was even providing Islamabad with ""live"" satellite inputs on Indian military movements and deployments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122257492,imgsize-982954,width-400,resizemode-4/122257492.jpg"

Make J&K dry like Gujarat: Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-jk-dry-like-gujarat-hurriyat-leader-mirwaiz/articleshow/122257107.cms,"SRINAGAR: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called Friday for J&K to be made a “dry state like Gujarat” as he opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction”.“J&K is a Muslim-majority region and sale and consumption of liquor is against Islam’s tenets,” Mirwaiz said during Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid. The trigger was a protest the previous day by locals in Srinagar’s Batmaloo against the opening of a liquor shop in the area that had not seen such outlets for decades.“If Gujarat can be declared a dry state, there is no reason why J&K should be exempted,” Mirwaiz said. This was the first call to protest in recent months on any issue from Mirwaiz, who is also chief cleric of Kashmir and has been put in home detention ahead of Friday prayers on many occasions in the past few months.Mirwaiz urged the state’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt and lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha to check the trend. “If govt does not act, we will be forced to protest. This isn’t a minor issue,” Mirwaiz said.Authorities have linked the new liquor licences and shops to a spurt in tourism since the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370. In the case of Batmaloo, excise officials claimed the shop, now shut after the agitation, was not a new one and had been only relocated from another area.Despite such opposition, J&K’s alcohol sales are on the rise. The Omar-led govt’s economic survey earlier this year estimated excise revenues at Rs 2,000 crore in 2024-25, up 4% over the previous year.Mirwaiz rejected the argument that liquor sales were necessary for tourism, pointing out that J&K had welcomed visitors for centuries without promoting alcohol. “Has J&K become a tourist spot only after 2019 (Article 370 abrogation)? For hundreds of years, tourists have visited us but liquor was never promoted on this scale in every locality,” Mirwaiz said.Drawing a comparison with Gujarat, Mirwaiz stressed that alcohol was banned there due to its impact on society and asked why similar concerns were not valid for J&K. “Don’t we have a society? Don’t we have to live here, too,” Mirwaiz said.According to him, over 1 lakh people in J&K are already affected by drug addiction and govt’s fillip to alcohol sales will only aggravate the crisis.Some local Kashmiri Pandits led by an activist, Sandeep Mawa, had recently demanded a ban on liquor sales in the Valley. In March this year, PDP MLA Fayaz Ahmad Mir had introduced a private member’s bill seeking such a ban across J&K. But the bill was not taken up for discussion or voting in the assembly. BJP, too, has expressed support for the ban, with former J&K party chief Ravinder Raina having led protests on the issue earlier.","Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called for J&K to be made a ‘dry state like Gujarat’ He opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122257172,imgsize-1585837,width-400,resizemode-4/122257172.jpg"

"On choosing life, always",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-choosing-life-always/articleshow/122249739.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Rithanya was just 27. Within barely 70 days of marriage, she ended her life . Before she slipped away, she sent seven audio notes to her father—apologising for the path she had chosen, unable—she said—to bear the harassment allegedly inflicted by her husband and in-laws. In one voice note, she whispered the most haunting of farewells: “I can’t live this life anymore.” We don’t know the full story. Investigations will unearth the details, and justice, hopefully, will find its way. Almost every human being, at some point, faces that bleak moment where they glance at the abyss, thinking, this is the only way out. But from deep within, something stirs—a raw instinct to survive. We rise. We whisper to ourselves, not yet. Not like this. But for many, it does. India accounts for nearly 38% of global suicide deaths among women and nearly 26% among men. Suicide is the leading cause of death for youngsters. One in three of them takes the step due to family issues. Psychologist Roy Baumeister described suicide as a response to a mind overwhelmed by failure, guilt, and self-loathing. The person visualises not only death, but the aftermath—grief, regret, even revenge. Death becomes not an end, but a statement. What drives this despair? Sometimes, it’s as trivial as a failed exam or a teacher’s rebuke. A heartbreak. Or, as in Rithanya’s case, the crushing belief that “marriage happens only once,” and breaking it is a sin beyond survival . Monogamy is a noble ideal. And yes, history is filled with those who have given up their lives for ideals. But a sacrifice earns nobility only when it serves a higher purpose—when it uplifts others, preserves truth, or advances justice. To give up one’s life because an ideal was challenged by personal suffering is not bravery, but tragedy. Parents, too, must unlearn the habit of clinging to social approval. Let your children fail, stumble, choose differently. If they want to walk out of a marriage, quit a course, skip an exam—so be it. What matters is not community whispers, but their heartbeat. Let them live. Let them outlive us. Let’s tell them that courage lies not in silent endurance, but in speaking out, walking away, or beginning afresh. For centuries, societies glorified suicide in the name of honour. Even Thirukkural praises those who choose death over disgrace: Ilivarin Vaazhadha Maanam Udayaar OliThozhudhu Eththum Ulagu. “The world will always praise and adore the fame of the honorable Who would rather die than suffer indignity.” But remember the context of such couplets. They were meant for warriors and tribes that fought for their identities. Extending them to individuals who are challenged by life events and threatened by societal norms may be in-appropriate. Let the new ideal be this: Honour belongs to those who live. Pride rests with the resilient. Let us stop eulogising those who fall into darkness and instead uplift those who walk through it. If Ridhanya had whispered to herself, ‘ one year from now, none of this will matter’, perhaps she might have lived. Her parents might have been spared a grief no justice can heal. We owe our children a new legacy—not one of quiet suffering, but of radiant survival. Because in the end, life is precious, and to live it—truly live it—takes more courage than we ever speak of.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122250148,imgsize-57366,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/122250148.jpg"

Even CUET high scorers upset over discrepancies

NEW DELHI: Two woman candidates feature among the top three in the Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate programmes (CUET-UG 2025), results for which were declared by National Testing Agency Friday. But declaration of results has not stopped candidates, including high scorers, from questioning syllabus deviations, errors in question papers and response sheets, as well as the normalisation process.Ananya Jain from Punjab, with an aggregate of 1225.93, emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for. Arjav Jain from Delhi secured the second-highest score, followed by Purva Singh from Haryana.Aneesh Jain from Rajasthan was in fourth place, followed by Raghav Saraf from Haryana.Around 13.54 lakh students registered for the exam this year, marginally higher than 13.47 lakh in 2024, but the number of candidates who appeared dropped to 10.71 lakh from 11.13 lakh last year.In the top 20 candidates, five are from Haryana, three from Delhi, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, and one each from Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra.This year, candidates scored full marks (250) in just five subjects, compared to full marks (200) being achieved in 45 subjects in 2024. The test covered 37 subjects and 13 languages, and was conducted over 19 days across 300 cities, including 15 international locations. The number of universities participating fell to 239 from 283 in 2024, indicating that some institutions opted out amid concerns about the test's evolving framework and operational challenges.Among subjects, psychology, political science, business studies, Punjabi, and Urdu saw candidates achieving the highest possible score of 250, while the top score in physical education was as low as 219, highlighting variations across disciplines. Seventeen candidates scored 100 percentile in three subjects, 150 managed it in two subjects, and 2,679 aspirants scored 100 percentile in one subject.Candidates continued to express frustration on social media over the exam and many have written to the education ministry seeking remedial action. Even high scorers voiced disappointment over discrepancies. Matangsih Zula from Ahmedabad, who wrote to the local MP and the ministry, said he had raised concerns with NTA about errors in response sheets and answer keys a month ago but got no reply. Zula, who scored 99 percentile in GAT, 97 in English, 94.5 in mathematics and 93 in economics, had challenged six questions in the provisional key, of which three were later corrected.Candidates particularly highlighted issues with the physical education paper, alleging that despite formal challenges, the agency failed to revise key answers. Aspirants pointed out that Unit 3 in the official syllabus allowed them to choose ""one sport of their choice,"" but the test carried mandatory questions from multiple sports. NTA had earlier stated: ""The panel of subject experts decided not to provide options in Unit 3, as it was deemed impractical. Questions included in the paper were fundamental in nature"". The response failed to allay concerns.","Ananya Jain from Punjab emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for.

They will be given prefabricated houses to stay in, for which we are building a thousand more,"" Singh said.On whether the situation had improved enough for displaced families to be confident about returning to areas ravaged by violence, he said resumption of farming activity was an encouraging sign. ""I am glad to share both sides (Meiteis and Kukis) are farming together. I mean, within eyeball-to-eyeball distance. And they are sharing water."""," Manipur plans to shut around 350 relief camps sheltering people displaced by ethnic violence since May 2023. Chief secretary PK Singh said Friday that the northeastern state was in talks with the ministry of home affairs to start rehabilitating the displaced. The number of displaced people has dropped from 62,000 to 57,000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122257421,imgsize-1480879,width-400,resizemode-4/122257421.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: Panjab University students have to give an undertaking at the time of admission to stay away from drugs and submit to medical tests at random. This mandatory declaration binds students and their parents to acknowledge university's zero-tolerance policy on drugs, alcohol and tobacco - both in hostels and on campus.According to new rules, students must consent to undergo random drug testing - including breath, blood or urine analysis - if deemed necessary by Panjab University (PU) authorities. The move is in line with a University Grants Commission advisory, calling on all higher educational institutions to implement anti-drug measures. It recommended obtaining written commitments from students, creating awareness, and strengthening surveillance systems to prevent substance abuse.The university's new undertaking warns of strict disciplinary action, including suspension, expulsion or legal proceedings against students found in possession of or involved in consumption or distribution of banned substances.PU authorities have also introduced compulsory guest registration in hostels and are in the process of tightening access control.Officials said the anti-drug undertaking was part of a broader crackdown to safeguard campus environment and student wellbeing.""This isn't just about one incident. The undertaking, awareness drives and improved monitoring are part of a systematic effort to make PU a safe and drug-free campus,"" said a senior official.PU has instructed all departments and hostel wardens to collect signed undertakings from students and their parents before finalizing admissions.The move comes after the death of an outsider of a suspected drug overdose in a PU boys' hostel in Nov. The case triggered scrutiny, especially after a student and a former student were arrested.","Panjab University students have to give an undertaking at the time of admission to stay away from drugs and submit to medical tests at random.

Relief for commercial vehicles: Up to 50% reduction in toll for elevated sections on NHs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relief-for-commercial-vehicles-up-to-50-reduction-in-toll-for-elevated-sections-on-nhs/articleshow/122257032.cms,"NEW DELHI: After announcing the Annual Toll Pass for private cars on NHs, the road transport ministry has notified a new rule to reduce the toll rate up to 50% for structures such as bridge, tunnel, flyover or elevated sections. This will bring relief to commercial and heavy vehicles, particularly on tolled sections that have more such structures.TOI on June 27 had first reported the govt decision to rationalise the toll.Till now the toll charge for structures on NHs and Expressways under Central govt was 10 times more than the normal user fee. But as per the fresh amendments to NH Toll Fee Rules notified on June 1, there will be two methodologies to calculate the toll charge and whichever is lower will be applicable.As per the new norm, the toll charge for a section of NH consisting of structure or structures will be calculated by adding 10 times the length of structure to the non-structure or normal road length or five times the total length of section of a tolled NH, whichever is lesser.This will bring major relief to those using highway stretches that have more than 50% length as structures.Take for example, if a tolled section of NH is 40 km — 30 km structure and 10 km normal road — then the minimum length will be computed as 10x30 + 10 = 310 km or five times the total length of the section which is 5x40 = 200 km.So, in this case, the toll charge will be collected for 200 km since it’s lower.But suppose, the 40 km tolled stretch has 10 km structures and 30 km normal road, then the minimum length will be calculated as 10x10 + 30 = 130 km or five times of the total length of the section which is 5x40 = 200 km. So, in this case, the toll charge will be collected for 130 km, something that is in practice now.In case the entire tolled corridor is one or more structures, the toll charge will be simply reduced to 50%.","Till now toll charge for structures on NHs and Expressways under Central govt was 10 times more than the normal user fee.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: While inaugurating Shri Amarnath Shrine Board’s Yatri Niwas Complex at Baltal, around 92km northeast of Srinagar, J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Friday said more than 20,000 devotees had already performed darshan at the holy cave. Meanwhile, the third batch of 6,411 pilgrims left Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the Himalayan shrine.This year’s annual pilgrimage began on July 3 and will conclude on Aug 9. The yatra is proceeding seamlessly along both routes — Pahalgam (Anantnag) and Baltal (Ganderbal) — amid tight security. Escorted by CRPF, devotees from the third batch travelled in 291 vehicles. Of them, 3,622 pilgrims took the Pahalgam route while 2,789 opted for Baltal.Sinha lauded the people of J&K for extending a warm welcome to the devotees. “There is an atmosphere of celebration across J&K. Pilgrims are feeling blessed to be part of this journey of faith and tradition,” he said.Sinha said the Baltal Yatri Niwas Complex, developed by ONGC under its CSR initiative, can accommodate 800 pilgrims and includes registration facilities. Devotees arriving before their scheduled date would be accommodated, but those with prior registration would be prioritized.ONGC is constructing similar facilities at Sidhra, Nunwan and Bijbehara at a cost of Rs 240 crore, he added.Sinha noted that widened tracks, safety railings, and grid-powered lighting have made the Yatra safer, allowing 24x7 monitoring. Over 3.5 lakh pilgrims have registered online so far.Traffic advisories have been issued for smooth movement on the Jammu-Srinagar NH, with fixed cut-off timings for Yatra convoys.","The third batch of 6,411 pilgrims left Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the Himalayan shrine.

Need to involve urban & transport planner in highway projects passing through cities & towns: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-involve-urban-transport-planner-in-highway-projects-passing-through-cities-towns-experts/articleshow/122256636.cms,"NEW DELHI: Planning and preparation of highway projects passing through urban areas must involve urban and transport planners, experts said at a conference on “Crash Safety and Physical Planning” held at IIT-Delhi on Friday.Director of School of Planning and Architecture, Virendra Kumar Paul claimed that highway engineers have less capability to evaluate detailed project reports (DPRs). “DPR is an issue. We had trained some NHAI engineers at IIT, Delhi. We could understand that they don’t have the competence to deal with DPRs. They don’t have interest in deep diving into the DPR either because they are too bureaucratic or give that task to an external consultant,” he said in the presence of Ajay Tamta, MoS of roadtransport and highways minietry.Highways passing through urban areas need special attention as the number of fatal crashes are usually higher due to more conflict of different road users.SPA and IIT-Delhi offered to the ministry to take up some pilot projects of evaluating DPRs prepared for NHAI and other agencies. The IIT leadership also suggested the minister to set up a Centre of Excellence to deal with crash investigation.Addressing the gathering, Tamta called for a paradigm shift from reactive construction to proactive, innovation-led planning, where road projects are no longer isolated engineering exercises, but integrated, multi-sectoral development tools. He said there is a need for innovations which not only improve safety, but also tackle chronic issues in road projects such as land acquisition challenges, urban traffic congestion, poor last-mile connectivity, and cost overruns.","Highways passing through urban areas need special attention as the number of fatal crashes are usually higher due to more conflict of different road users.

NEW DELHI: Laying out a detailed process for uploading details of waqf properties registered with Waqf boards on the new Central Waqf Portal launched last month, the govt on Thursday notified the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment Efficiency and Development Rules 2025 dealing with the portal and database of waqf properties and the process for their registration, audit and maintenance of accounts.For instance, the Mutawalli (caretaker) of a waqf, existing on or before April 8, the date of commencement of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, will need to upload details like boundaries of waqf properties, their use and occupier; the name and address of the creator of the waqf, the mode and date of creation, the deed of waqf, if available; details of beneficiaries; the annual income from waqf properties and details of land-revenue, cesses, taxes payable annually and the purpose for which the waqf was created.The details of all existing waqf properties are to be uploaded on the portal within the stipulated six months as prescribed by the amended law. There are over 9 lakh waqf properties in India as per the data available with the ministry of minority affairs.The new rules also require that after completion of survey, the state govts must publish the list of ‘auqaf’ (waqf properties) and upload it on the portal and database, within a period of 90 days from the date of publication of the list in the official gazette.In what clearly shows that delays will not be allowed, the rules make it clear that if the Mutawalli fails to upload details within the stipulated timeframe, he will have to go to the tribunal to seek extension of time.After the Mutawalli files the details, the chief executive officer or any other officer authorised by the Waqf Board will verify the details of the waqf property and certify the authenticity of the information within a fixed timeframe.In case of registration of new waqf properties after April 8, 2025, the Mutawalli will file an application to the board for its registration within three months of its creation. A copy of the waqf deed will be required to be uploaded.In case of inquiry into wrongful declaration of waqf, the designated officer will complete the inquiry and submit their report within a period of one year from the date of reference made to him by the collector.As per the rules the joint secretary in the ministry of minority affairs in charge of the waqf division will be in-charge of the supervision of the portal and database which will include features for real-time monitoring of waqf properties, institutional governance, court cases and dispute resolution, financial oversight resource management and for surveys.Every state govt will have to appoint a nodal officer and establish a centralised support unit for providing assistance in streamlining uploading details of waqf, registration, maintenance of accounts, audit and other related activities of the waqf and the Board.The functioning of the portal and database shall be reviewed at the end of every financial year by an independent agency to be appointed by the central govt.The govt will have to publish the report of the agency and the action taken report on the recommendations of the agency on the portal and database within a period of three months from the date of submission of the report.",The new rules lay out a detailed process for uploading details of waqf properties registered with Waqf boards on the new Central WaqF Portal launched last month.

UltraSound & fabric study

In the hushed corridors of the International Space Station (ISS), where human voices float as weightlessly as the bodies that carry them, Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla and his Ax-4 crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space — quite literally.The Ax-4 crew recently lent their voices to the “Voice in Space” study, a pioneering experiment investigating how microgravity alters human speech. Without gravity’s usual pull on the lungs, diaphragm, and vocal tract, even subtle changes in vocal fold vibration or tone can occur.Using electroglottography — a non-invasive technique used to measure vocal fold contact during voice production — sensors and a series of scripted vocal tasks, researchers are capturing these shifts to understand how spaceflight affects speech patterns and cognition.The aim? To train artificial intelligence systems that can one day monitor astronaut health in real time — and perhaps even enhance voice-based AI technologies back on Earth. This study blends physiology, acoustics, and machine learning.“This experiment seeks to determine whether the influenced voice pattern and listening capabilities of the participant might be able to be detected by an AI algorithm. Vocal characteristics of an ISS crew member can change in a zero-gravity, and after undergoing cognitive function changes.Measurements of vocal fold vibration provide a quantitative indication of vocal fold function,” as per Axiom Space.Scripted voice audio recordings — reading, singing, vowel enunciation, audio pitch matching— allow for tonal analysis, Axiom said, adding that these data allow the investigator to test and analyse vocal performance and voice pattern changes in space and then evaluate how space journey influences the human voice.But sound wasn’t the only thing on the crew’s mind. Alongside the voice study, they completed multiple sessions of the “Cerebral Hemodynamics” investigation — an exploration into how blood flows through the brain in a zero-gravity environment.Without gravity pulling fluids downward, astronauts often experience a fluid shift towards the head. By using ultrasound to monitor these changes, scientists hope to develop better diagnostic tools for cardiovascular and neurological conditions — tools that could serve both astronauts and patients on Earth suffering from stroke, dizziness, or fainting.Also on the roster of the Ax-4 crew is the “Suit Fabric Study”, a technology demonstration examining how clothing behaves in space. This isn’t just about comfort — it's about performance. The crew wore sensor-equipped garments during exercise to observe how heat and moisture are managed when convection is no longer at play.“The findings could inform the design of next-generation space suits — and inspire innovations in thermal wear on Earth, from sports gear to medical textiles,” Axiom added.",Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla and his crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space.

On one side, there is China and on the other, Pakistan. Today, Nepal is also distancing itself from us. Everybody is moving away from us.”The Congress chief said that despite visiting 42 countries, PM Modi has not visited Manipur, where ethnic violence has led to loss of life. “He has travelled to 42 countries in the world, but so far he has not visited Manipur, where people are dying,” Kharge said.He accused PM Modi of neglecting domestic issues in favour of international appearances. “Modi ji, where are you? He is visiting eight countries, but he’s not looking towards his country's people. He is not looking at the farmers of this country,” he added.Kharge also alleged that the government under PM Modi has harmed the Indian economy over the last 11 years and undermined the Constitution.“He has ruined the country’s economy and destroyed the Constitution,” he said.He further mocked the prime minister, saying, “If someone gives Modi a cap or a medal he will wear it and go around,” urging that the focus should instead be on the welfare of farmers and the common people.Additionally, in a sharp attack on the RSS and BJP, Kharge referred to recent comments attributed to an RSS functionary suggesting the removal of the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ from the Constitution.“I challenge them – be it him, their BJP, PM Modi or Amit Shah – no one can remove those words,” Kharge said.During his address in Hindi, he said: “I heard that an RSS leader from Shimoga said that the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ should be removed from the Constitution. I challenge all of them – BJP, PM Modi, Amit Shah – no one can do it.”Reading from the BJP’s own organisational constitution, Kharge pointed out that the party’s own document states allegiance to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy.“If you hate secularism and socialism so much, why have you written it in your party’s Constitution?” he asked. “Your own party constitution says the BJP shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy. Then why are you trying to remove these values now?”Kharge also cited past Indo-Pak conflicts while criticising the current government's posture.He said: “You talk big about Pakistan. We helped them in the past. Then why did you back away? You say you ended the war between India and Pakistan. You say you calmed things down. Then why are you silent now, Prime Minister? Speak up. There is no need for Trump in India. We are strong, and we are ready to fight – just as Indira Gandhi once split Pakistan and created Bangladesh.”He urged PM Modi to stop misleading the people and to act decisively if the country’s interests are at stake.“If you had to act, you were in power, you could have. Don’t mislead the country. Don’t confuse the people,” he said.",Mallikarjun Kharge says India's foreign policy is flawed and has led to deteriorating ties with neighbouring countries.

BJP: No one will be homeless in Capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-no-one-will-be-homeless-in-capital/articleshow/117185779.cms,"BJP

New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva on Sunday claimed that AAP's Arvind Kejriwal did not take any initiative in the past 10 years to improve the standard of living of people residing in slum clusters in Delhi.He said if BJP formed its govt in Delhi, it would ensure that every homeless person in Delhi received a house under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana . ""You (AAP) have been in office for over a decade. Please clarify if your govt, through DUSIB or any other department, has undertaken any significant effort to rehabilitate slum dwellers,"" he said.Sachdeva also gave some guarantees on behalf of BJP to Delhi's poor. ""Slum dwellers who wish to stay in their current areas will be allowed to remain there,"" he said. 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahin Makaan' scheme would continue to benefit slum residents, he added. Sachdeva promised that DUSIB and DDA would provide alternative houses or flats to slum dwellers.He was speaking to the press while celebrating his birthday with residents of Nehru Camp in Patparganj constituency during BJP's slum outreach campaign. He said, ""If the BJP comes to power, we will make this Nehru Camp a model slum with regards to sanitation by Jan 2026.""At a press conference held in Nehru Camp later, Sachdeva alleged that, in 10 years, Kejriwal allowed 50,000 flats, built under Rajiv Awas Yojana, in areas like Narela to turn into ruins, without allotting even one flat to any slum dweller. He said that, despite being in office for over 10 years, Kejriwal had done nothing to transform slum clusters into model settlements or improve the living standards of the residents. ""The last 10 years bear witness to the fact that Arvind Kejriwal can only provoke people, but cannot improve their lives,"" Sachdeva added.""Kejriwal claims to provide free electricity to the poor, but some residents of Nehru Camp in former deputy CM Manish Sisodia's constituency, Patparganj, are receiving monthly electricity bills ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 8,000. Additionally, they are forced to purchase drinking water,"" he claimed.""It is unfortunate that, despite Kejriwal's various claims, the income of Delhi's poor slum-dwelling families is consumed entirely by electricity bills and water costs,"" he claimed. He said every poor person knew that PM Modi had provided not just lakhs but crores of houses across villages and cities in the country, which was why every slum dweller today looked towards BJP.BJP is leveraging its in situ rehabilitation programmes to challenge AAP's stronghold. Recently, Modi inaugurated 1,675 newly built flats at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar for JJ cluster residents and distributed keys to eligible recipients. He also announced plans for 3,000 more residential units.There are around 700 slums in Delhi, home to a significant portion of the city's population. These settlements often lack basic amenities like sanitation, with open drains exposing residents to poor living conditions. People from poor economic backgrounds work in sectors like construction, domestic work and street vending.","Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva claimed that AAP's Arvind Kejriwal did not take any initiative in the past 10 years to improve the standard of living of people residing in slum clusters.

NEW DELHI: Groundwater quality varies considerably across India, with certain states and UT such as Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and J&K fully meeting BIS standards while states like Rajasthan, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh facing widespread contamination, shows a report recently released by 'Jal Shakti' ministry.A notable concern in the report, based on quality data at 15,259 groundwater monitoring locations and focused assessment at 4,982 trend stations across the country in 2023, is the ""elevated levels of uranium in several regions"". Rajasthan and Punjab are shown as regional hotspots of uranium contamination .The samples with high uranium concentrations were clustered in areas identified as 'over-exploited', 'critical', and 'semi-critical' groundwater stress zones, such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The report also reflects significant concerns over the quality of water due to high concentrations of nitrate, fluoride, arsenic, and iron in groundwater. Almost 20% of the samples exceeded the permissible limit for nitrate while 9% of samples had fluoride levels above the acceptable limit. Arsenic contamination was found in 3.5% of samples.""This is particularly worrying because long-term exposure to both contaminants (fluoride and arsenic) can have severe health consequences, including fluorosis (for fluoride) and cancer or skin lesions (for arsenic),"" said the report.Fluoride concentration exceeding the permissible limit is a major concern in Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. ""Although the monsoon season led to some improvement in fluoride levels in these states, the overall contamination levels remain alarmingly high,"" said the report.Rajasthan, TN and Maharashtra have some of the highest incidences of nitrate contamination , with over 40% of water samples exceeding the permissible limit. The report attributed it primarily to agricultural run-off and overuse of fertilizers.","A notable concern in the report is the ""elevated levels of uranium in several regions"" Rajasthan and Punjab are shown as regional hotspots of uranium contamination.

KOLKATA: Days after a new mother died at Kolkata's Midnapore Medical College (MMC) allegedly after she was administered expired Ringer's lactate saline, three women whose condition deteriorated along with her were found to have acute kidney injury and required dialysis. These women were also administered the saline after C-section delivery at the hospital. Two are on ventilation, and the third is in the ICU.All three were shifted to SSKM Hospital late on Sunday. While Ringer's lactate is suspected to be the cause, a 13-member committee probing the case is yet to ascertain this. ""The initial suspicion falls on Ringer's lactate, but we have to look into other possible factors,"" said a committee member.Committee members said while the banned Ringer's lactate was used, which was not ideal, the same fluid was used on other patients in other departments where it did not cause any death or deterioration. The members said they will wait for the drug analysis report of the batch of the IV fluid, which may take about two weeks.Five women who underwent C-section at MMC on Wednesday fell ill after the procedure. Mamoni Ruidas (22) died two days later, and three are critical. Families alleged their condition deteriorated after they were administered Ringer's lactate, which is used for replenishing fluid.","Five women who underwent C-section at Kolkata's Midnapore Medical College fell ill after the procedure.

NEW DELHI: Focus more on creating facilities, amenities and better transportation network in zones in cities which naturally attract people and businesses, rather than developing new cities that push horizontal growth, PM Narendra Modi told top officials of housing and urban affairs ministry at a recent review meeting on urban sector, sources said.TOI has learnt that the ministry had made a detailed presentation on roadmap for urban development , focusing on planned growth of cities, before the PM. It was attended by top officials from PMO, cabinet secretariat, Niti Aayog and finance ministry.Modi was of the view that while certain areas or zones in existing cities have enough ingredients to attract people to come and work, it is difficult to convince or persuade people to shift to a new city.Following PM's suggestions, the ministry will start work on a better framework for transit-oriented development (TOD) for cities to push intensive and planned growth along transportation networks, sources said, adding the focus has to be on how to allow vertical development in influence zones of such transit corridors, & ensure decongestion to create enough public and open space.""While a lot depends on states as land use is a subject under 'State List', Centre must come up with a sound prescription and policy that can be replicated across states. But, while making such a policy, there is a need to take states on board and make them partners,"" said a former Union urban development secretary. He said to unclog areas around existing transit corridors, states need to permit higher floor area ratio (FAR) for vertical growth when redevelopment takes place.TOD is a planning and design strategy that aims at creating sustainable urban growth centres that are walkable, compact, and integrated with robust public transit. Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hong Kong SAR, Tokyo, and Singapore are some examples where TOD has been deployed effectively.","PM Narendra Modi told top officials of housing and urban affairs ministry at a recent review meeting on urban sector.

NEW DELHI: AAP supremo and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launched a sharp attack on Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, challenging him to withdraw cases against slum dwellers and guarantee housing for them. Kejriwal said that he would not contest the upcoming Delhi assembly elections if Shah fulfilled his demands.“Withdraw all the cases filed against slum residents and submit an affidavit in court guaranteeing that they will receive houses on the same land from which they were evicted. If you do this, I will not contest the elections. I challenge you to accept this. Otherwise, let it be clear—Kejriwal is here to stay,” he said during a press conference in the Shakur Basti area.Accusing the BJP of prioritising land acquisition over the welfare of slum residents, Kejriwal alleged that the saffron party was only seeking votes while planning to displace residents after the elections. “They are after your votes now, but after the elections, they’ll be after your land,” he said.The AAP leader also targeted the BJP’s 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan' scheme as a hollow promise, claiming that only 4,700 flats had been constructed for slum dwellers over the past five years. He accused the BJP of intending to clear slums without addressing the residents’ housing concerns. “They want to grab the land and have no regard for the people living there,” he said.Kejriwal was joined by senior AAP leader Satyendar Jain , who is contesting from the Shakur Basti constituency for the fourth consecutive time.

"Amid H-1B visa debate, some Indians lose jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-h-1b-visa-debate-some-indians-lose-jobs/articleshow/117181707.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Indian professionals are facing the heat in the wake of a raging debate over H-1B visa reforms in the US. With President-elect Donald Trump's administration expected to introduce stricter immigration policies , several professionals have already been hit by job offer withdrawals, visa delays and warnings of potential layoffs.TOI spoke to eight professionals in the US and in Hyderabad, and at least three had their job offers abruptly revoked due to ""visa-related concerns"". Hyderabad-based software engineer Vaishnavi Puvvada is one such professional. Hired by a US tech giant in Dec, she was preparing to move to San Francisco when her offer was revoked. She had, meanwhile, quit her current job.""I was offered the job in Dec 2024 and since I had a written confirmation, I resigned from my current job,"" said the 28-year-old.The company cited ""changing visa dynamics"" as the reason for withdrawing the offer. ""I feel cheated. Why offer a role when you're not sure about sponsoring the visa? They later said that they will issue my offer letter again when the whole discussion is settled and there is a concrete decision after Donald Trump assumes office. But how long can I wait?"" Vaishnavi said.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, over 72% of the 380,000 H1B visas issued in 2023 went to Indians, most of whom work in STEM fields like data science, AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. These professionals earn an average salary of $118,000 (about Rs 1.01 crore) annually.However, Indian professionals in the US are staring at an increasingly challenging environment as Trump's administration is expected to ""reform"" the H1B programme by increasing salary thresholds and costs for employers, aiming to prioritise American workers. There's also a growing backlash from MAGA supporters, who have often targeted the H1B visa, claiming it undermines American jobs and wages.The fear of unemployment is affecting those waiting for visa renewals. Saniya Haji, a cybersecurity consultant in Los Angeles, is facing delays in her H1B visa sponsorship.""Initially, the company promised to expedite the process (of sponsoring the H1B). But now they claim they are ‘waiting for clarity' on the potential visa reforms. The wait is agonising,"" she said.Saniya, who moved from Nagpur to US in 2022 for her master's degree, is unsure of her future. ""I was told they would register me for the H1B lottery in March 2025. But they haven't even initiated the preliminary stages of the process. Does it mean they are going to file for my H1B later, or are they going to just fire me if there is any major reform?"" she wondered.A woman from Telangana, who recently secured a position as a data analyst after an extended job search, now faces a new challenge as her company expresses uncertainty about sponsoring her visa.""Now that I have finally secured a position as a data analyst, the uncertainty around the H1B visa has come to haunt me. I can't even think of facing the trauma of unemployment again,"" she said, preferring to remain anonymous.Similarly, a software developer from Gujarat working in California, is feeling anxious despite holding a secure visa. His company recently announced workforce reductions, adding to his worries.""The management hasn't stated categorically if these layoffs are linked to visa issues, but the timing is suspicious,"" he said, choosing to remain anonymous. ""If we lose our job, we have to find another within 60 days to be able to continue staying here.""With unemployment at record levels and increasing uncertainties for Indian immigrants, he said finding a new job with H1B sponsorship within such a short period would be difficult. ""It is terrifying to think that I could lose my job and my legal status in the US any moment,"" he said.A senior immigration lawyer based in Georgia, speaking on condition of anonymity, elaborated on the broader implications.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's foreign affairs ministry summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to send its message to New Delhi to advise all relevant authorities in India to refrain from any ""provocative actions"" that could escalate tensions along the shared border between the two countries.During the meeting at his office, foreign secretary Md Jashim Uddin conveyed Bangladesh's ""deep concern"" to Verma over the ""recent activities"" of the BSF, particularly the ""unauthorised"" attempt to construct barbed wire fencing at several places along the border and the related operational actions. These have caused tensions and disturbances along the border, he said.After the meeting that lasted over half an hour, high commissioner said, ""I just met the foreign secretary to discuss India's commitment to ensuring a crime-free border, effectively addressing challenges of smuggling, movement of criminals and trafficking. We have an understanding with regard to fencing the border for security. BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) have been in communication in this regard.""The foreign secretary, however, said construction of barbed wire fences without proper authorisation undermines the spirit of cooperation and friendly relations between the two neighbouring countries. He hoped that the BGB-BSF DG level talks in Feb would be able to discuss the matter at length.Meanwhile, Bangladesh's home affairs adviser Lt Gen (Retd.) Md. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Sunday claimed that India stopped the construction of barbed wire fences five places along the border following the ""strong stance"" taken by the BGB and local residents.He said it has been decided to issue a letter to cancel the ""unequal agreements"" on border fencing made during the previous Sheikh Hasina government.Foreign secretary Jashim Uddin, referring to the recent killing of a Bangladesh citizen at Sunamganj by BSF, expressed deep concern and disappointment over such repetition of border killings. He called for urgent action by Indian authorities to stop recurrence of such incidents and conduct enquiries into all these border killings and take actions against those responsible.He mentioned that it is also a matter of grave concern that despite repeated firm commitments from Indian authorities to pursue non-lethal strategy and stop killings such incidents of killing have been continuing.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs ministry summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to send its message to New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said no force can stop India from becoming a developed nation, thanks to its human capital in the form of youth power.Addressing the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue at Bharat Mandapam, Modi said he has blind faith on Swami Vivekananda and his belief on the country's youth, and urged them to take ownership of the nation's future, calling for active participation in shaping policies, fostering innovation, and considering politics as a platform for impactful action.Reiterating the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, Modi said, ""Those who merely crunch numbers may find it difficult, but my inner conviction, supported by your trust, tells me that while the goal is ambitious, it is not impossible. The determination of crores of youth is propelling the nation forward, and we will surely achieve our targets.""The dialogue, held on National Youth Day to mark Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary, aligns with the PM's vision to inspire one lakh youth with no prior political background to actively participate in the political arena.He also spoke about how shared goals drive progress. ""History teaches and inspires us. There are countless examples worldwide where a nation or community, united with a common goal, achieved incredible feats. In the 1930s, the US was mired in a severe economic crisis. People resolved to overcome it through the 'New Deal' and not only emerged from the crisis, but also accelerated their development. Singapore, once a small fishing village, became a global financial and trade hub through collective efforts and disciplined leadership,"" he said.'Sankalp se Siddhi (realisation through resolve)' emerged as a recurring theme, with Modi spotlighting milestones such as India's open-defecation-free status, universal banking access, and rapid development of a Covid-19 vaccine.While underscoring India's recent accomplishments in startups, manufacturing, sports and digital transformation, and attributing these to the energy and determination of young leaders, Modi said, ""In just a decade, you have brought India to the forefront of global progress."" He urged every citizen to take ownership of the journey to development. Stating that achieving the vision of a developed India by 2047 is not far off and it only requires daily targets, relentless pursuit, and collective effort, Modi said, ""When India achieves its goals, it will not only transform the nation but also inspire the world.""The PM also visited an exhibition on contributions from participants of the dialogue. He spent six hours engaging with 3,000 young leaders. Modi was also shown 10 presentations on topics like sustainable development, integrating technology in agriculture, and strategies for making India a manufacturing and startup hub. During the sessions, the PM offered suggestions, and encouraged the youth to pursue transformative ideas.

NEW DELHI: India plans to ink at least four mega defence deals for fighters, submarines, helicopters and artillery guns, collectively worth over Rs 1.5 lakh crore, before this fiscal ends on March 31, as part of the long-term plan to boost the firepower and combat capabilities of the armed forces.The first off the block will be the around Rs 63,000 crore contract with France for the direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighter jets, which will operate from the deck of indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, defence sources told TOI.The deal for the 22 single-seat maritime jets and four twin-seat trainers for the Navy, along with weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support as well as spares for the 36 Rafales already inducted by the IAF, is now headed for the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS), the sources added.Another major deal with France will be the Rs 38,000 crore one for three additional Scorpene diesel-electric submarines, with air-independent propulsion (AIP) for longer underwater endurance, to be built at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL).The three new boats — with the first slated to roll out by 2031, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each — will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore ‘Project-75’. The sixth submarine ‘Vagsheer’ is slated to be commissioned, along with guided-missile destroyer Surat and stealth frigate Nilgiri, by PM Narendra Modi on Jan 15.“The Rafale deal is likely to be cleared by the CCS before this month ends, and will be followed by the Scorpene deal soon after,” a source said. Modi, incidentally, is slated to visit France for the Artificial Intelligence Summit on Feb 11 and 12.The other two mega deals are for 156 indigenous Prachand light combat helicopters for around Rs 53,000 crore and 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS) for Rs 8,500 crore.The 156 new Prachand helicopters (90 for Army, 66 IAF), which are capable of offensive operations in high-altitude areas like Siachen Glacier and eastern Ladakh, will be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. They will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and five Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract inked in 2022.The ATAGS designed and developed by DRDO, which is touted to have a strike range up to 48 km, in turn, will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems.With Bharat Forge emerging as the L-1 (lowest bidder), it will manufacture 60% of the guns, while Tata will produce the rest 40%. The order for 307 ATAGS is likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.“The aim is to sign all the four deals within this fiscal. Work is also underway to revise the Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 to further cut down procurement timelines, streamline processes and provide a level playing field to all,” another source said.","India plans to ink at least four mega defence deals for fighters, submarines, helicopters and artillery guns, collectively worth over Rs 1.5 lakh crore.

"Groundwater recharge declined marginally in 2024, dip in water availability too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/groundwater-recharge-declined-marginally-in-2024-dip-in-water-availability-too/articleshow/117182060.cms,"Data shows that the annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023.

NEW DELHI: Total annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally declined in 2024, compared to 2023, and so did water availability due to higher groundwater extraction last year, with northwest India, including parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh, being the bigger culprits.The Central Ground Water Board 's annual assessment report, released recently by the 'Jal Shakti' (water resources) ministry, also shows that the percentage of 'critical' and 'over-exploited' assessment units (block/taluk/tehsil/mandal), put together, increased in 2024, compared to the previous year, reflecting a bigger concern of inadequate recharge of groundwater in certain states, which extracted more for multiple use.The percentage of 'over-exploited' and 'critical' administrative units are more than 25% of the total units in the states and UTs of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu. It means groundwater extraction in these states and UTs substantially exceeded the annually replenishable groundwater recharge - a situation that might lead to water scarcity in due course if business-as-usual scenario remains.Data shows that the annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023. Accordingly, the annual extractable groundwater resources has also decreased marginally from 407.21 in 2023 to 406.19 BCM in 2024. In 2022, the total annual groundwater recharge was 437.6 BCM, whereas extractable groundwater resources was 398.08 BCM.Though the annual groundwater recharge and availability last year was much higher than 2022, the decline compared to 2023 is a concern, even as the year got good monsoon rainfall. The board has attributed it mainly to reduction in return flow from irrigation.The main source of replenishable groundwater resources is recharge from rainfall, which contributes to nearly 61% of the total annual groundwater recharge. Since over 75% of annual rainfall is received during the summer monsoon (June to Sept), the ministry's annual campaign 'Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls', by creating rainwater harvesting and conservation infrastructure through people's participation and states' cooperation, might show results in the long run. Though improvement in the groundwater situation is noticeable if it is compared with 2017, when the annual groundwater recharge was 431.86 BCM and the annual extractable groundwater resources 392.7 BCM, parts of northwest India invariably play spoilsport by indiscriminately extracting substantial amount of groundwater leading to over exploitation. Groundwater extraction for cultivating water-guzzling paddy in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh is one of the key reasons behind over exploitation in the region.""In some areas of the country, good continuous rainfall and management practices like groundwater augmentation and conservation measures taken up under central and state govt initiatives have resulted in improvement in the groundwater situation,"" said the report.Certain western parts of the country, particularly those of Rajasthan and Gujarat, also fall in the over-exploited zone, as groundwater recharge is limited due to the region's arid climate, leading to stress on the resource. On the other hand, groundwater availability is low due to characteristics of crystalline aquifers in southern part of peninsular India, including parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.","Annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023.

Deduct Rs 1.8 lakh from Rs 5.2 lakh granted as med expenses to claimant, orders HC

BENGALURU: The amount received by an accident victim under a mediclaim policy must be deducted from the total compensation under the head of medical expenses and hospitalisation charges , Karnataka HC has held based on Motor Vehicles Act Justice Hanchate Sanjeevkumar directed Oriental Insurance Company to pay Rs 4.93 lakh along with interest of 6 per cent a year to the family of S Hanumanthappa, a resident of Marathahalli in Bengaluru, after deducting Rs 1.8 lakh he had received from mediclaim. Hanumanthappa and his wife were travelling on a bike on Dec 10, 2008 when an autorickshaw dashed against them. He suffered fractures and was treated in various hospitals.He moved the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bengaluru. He claimed he was aged about 58 years, working as a teacher, and was drawing a salary of Rs 10,000 per month. On March 22, 2013, the tribunal awarded Rs 6.7 lakh, including Rs 5.2 lakh under the head of medical expenses.The insurer challenged the order, contending that Rs 5.2 lakh medical expenses was not correct, as Hanumanthappa got mediclaim reimbursements earlier.Justice Sanjeevkumar cited another Karnataka HC case in which the court had held that if the claimant got his medical expenses reimbursed, they can be deducted from accident compensation.“Therefore, in the present case, the amount received by the claimant under mediclaim is liable to be deducted from medical expenses while determining the compensation under the said head. The appellant (insurer) has produced evidence that the claimant received a mediclaim reimbursement amount of Rs 1.8 lakh. This fact is not disputed by the respondents/claimants,” the judge said. The HC ordered a deduction of Rs 1.8 lakh from Rs 5.2 lakh awarded as medical expenses to Hanumanthappa, determining the payout under this head at Rs 3.4 lakh.","S Hanumanthappa and his wife were travelling on a bike on Dec 10, 2008 when an autorickshaw dashed against them.

This year, given the rising number of manja injuries, more people have asked for it,"" said Sagar Sonawane, whose shop sells the rods.Police on their part have welcomed the installations. Authorities haven't yet objected because the rods don't impede vision, and their own efforts against nylon manja have fallen woefully short. ""I sincerely hope demand for manja falls. We've so far externed as many as 74 people who were caught selling the thread. The action will intensify,"" said a senior police officer, while urging those on two-wheelers to wear helmets.","Nashik records several cases of two-wheeler riders sustaining severe injuries during kite-flying season. Citizens have installed aluminium rods to their scooters and bikes to protect their necks and faces from nylon manja. The rods cost less than Rs 50, but they may save your life.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117180187,imgsize-71720,width-400,resizemode-4/117180187.jpg"

Poll Which Has Greater Influence on Elections? Candidate's Past Performance Party Manifestos

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva on Sunday launched a sharp salvo at AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal , accusing him of attempting to incite ""religious conflict"" in the capital ahead of Delhi assembly elections . Sachdeva alleged that Kejriwal wrote to the Election Commission, requesting the removal of Dalit voters from the Valmiki Temple area in Gol Market.""Arvind Kejriwal wants to incite religious conflict in Delhi. He has requested the Election Commission to cut the votes of 44 Dalit voters near Valmiki Temple. Why? Because they are Dalits,"" Sachdeva claimed, adding that Kejriwal had previously insulted Purvanchalis and was now targeting Dalits to further caste politics.Sachdeva also highlighted alleged bias in Kejriwal's approach. ""There is a Mazar near the Valmiki Temple with 60 registered voters, none of whom live in the area, but Kejriwal has not requested their removal. He is targeting Hindu Dalits instead,"" he alleged.BJP Patel Nagar candidate Raaj Kumar Anand echoed these sentiments, claiming Kejriwal was under pressure. ""Sources suggest Kejriwal might contest from another seat as well, indicating his lack of confidence in the elections. If he loses, how will he remain the chief minister?"" Anand asked.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh also launched a scathing attack, calling Kejriwal the ""kingpin"" of the alleged liquor scam. ""Kejriwal came to power promising schools but delivered liquor shops. During Covid-19, when people were struggling, he was busy building his 'Sheesh Mahal.' Delhi won’t forgive him for this,"" Chugh asserted.The BJP has ramped up criticism of the AAP-led government, accusing it of corruption, inefficiency in welfare schemes, and failing to tackle Delhi’s pollution crisis. The party has gone as far as branding AAP's governance as an ""AAPda"" (disaster).Meanwhile, AAP has retaliated, labeling the BJP as the "" Galli Galoch Party "" and accusing it of engaging in dishonest tactics and electoral fraud.The Delhi assembly elections are set for February 5, with results announced on February 8. Nominations close on January 17, with scrutiny on January 18 and withdrawals allowed until January 20.The Congress, once dominant in Delhi for 15 years, continues to struggle, failing to secure any seats in the last two elections.

Poll Do You Support the Use of GRAP to Tackle Air Pollution? No, It Doesn’t Address the Root Causes Yes, It's an Effective Approach

NEW DELHI: The central panel overseeing Delhi-NCR's air quality revoked Stage-III restrictions under GRAP on Sunday, as pollution levels decreased due to suitable weather conditions, as per an official directive. A western disturbance brought light rain to Delhi and surrounding areas, enhancing the region's air quality.""The AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 278 at 4:00 PM today which is 72 points below the 350 mark to implement the Stage-III as per the extant directives of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Further, the forecast by IMD predicts another WD (Western Disturbance) in the region around 14th-15th January, 2025. ""The Sub-Committee, accordingly, decided to revoke its orders dated 09.01.2025, for invoking actions under Stage-III (‘Severe’ Air Quality) of the Schedule of GRAP (Revised December, 2024), with immediate effect,"" said the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), the Sub-Committee on GRAP, in its order.The order further stated that GRAP 1 and GRAP 2 will still remain in effect. ""Actions under Stage-I & II of the revised GRAP shall, however, remain invoked and be implemented, monitored, and reviewed by all the agencies concerned in the entire NCR to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further. All implementing agencies shall keep strict vigil and especially intensify measures under Stage-I & II of the revised GRAP,"" stated the order.The panel also urged that, ""While GRAP Stage-III is being revoked, keeping in view the winter season when weather conditions may not always be favorable, and in order to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further, citizens are requested to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP-II.""""The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and reviewing the situation from time to time for further appropriate decisions depending upon the Air Quality in Delhi and forecasts made by IMD/IITM,"" it further read.Stage-III measures, reinstated on Thursday, prohibit non-essential construction work. Schools up to grade five are allowed to offer hybrid learning (online and in-person). BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, excluding those used by people with disabilities, are also restricted while older diesel-powered medium goods vehicles are banned in Delhi under Stage III.The GRAP outlines four stages of air quality: Stage I (Poor), Stage II (Very Poor), Stage III (Severe), and Stage IV (Severe Plus). Another weather system is expected to impact northwest India around January 14-15. Winter air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region is caused by a combination of weather patterns, vehicle exhaust, agricultural burning, fireworks, and other local sources.","A western disturbance brought light rain to Delhi and surrounding areas, enhancing the region's air quality.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

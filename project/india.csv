Road ministry for no construction along 15 m on either side of Centre-built Ring roads/bypasses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/road-ministry-for-no-construction-along-15-m-on-either-side-of-centre-built-ring-roads/bypasses/articleshow/122377922.cms,"NEW DELHI: No construction will be allowed along 15 metres on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and Ring Roads to be built by Union govt across states, as part of a policy the road transport ministry is in the process of finalising. State govts will have to notify these as “No Construction Green zone” under their planning laws, prohibiting any development activity.This will be the major thrust of the ministry’s “access-controlled Ring Roads/bypass” policy for decongesting major cities to ensure such stretches don't face congestion due to ribbon development. Ribbon development refers to linear development along roads, with buildings coming up with direct access to transportation networks.In response to a question on how the ministry is addressing the problem of unregulated ribbon development along ring roads and bypasses at a recent meeting of PPPAC, an inter-ministerial panel for appraisal of projects built in Public Private Partnership mode, it said, “Under the proposed policy, emphasis is on regulated development along proposed bypasses. The policy would require a development control zone of 15m on either side of the NH bypass or ring road being notified by the state govt as a green zone under the planning laws enacted by the state, where development shall be prohibited unless it is for public transport or mobility infrastructure, public utility infrastructure like electricity, water or sewerage pipeline or green zone infrastructure”.The ministry also said that beyond the no-construction green zone, state govts can plan, develop, or regulate the development of residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional infrastructure within a two-km radius on either side of the bypass or ring road. This will facilitate economic activity using the ring road or bypass as the centre of development in a regulated manner.Access to ring roads and bypasses would be only through service roads, which would be constructed at the time of project development, and entry to the main carriageway would be provided only through slip roads or interchanges, the ministry said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked the ministry to come up with a model for development of Ring Roads and bypasses by this month end. He has also instructed the ministry to put in place a permanent mechanism or institutional set-up for proper planning and mapping of such projects by the end of August.","No construction will be allowed along 15 metres on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and Ring Roads to be built by Union govt across states.

Nationwide strike called by trade unions had little impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nationwide-strike-called-by-trade-unions-had-little-impact/articleshow/122377407.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The nationwide strike called by trade unions on Wednesday had little impact on attendance across sectors with the banking sector seeing the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.Estimates from 20 major cities across the country that are available with the Centre showed that sectors such as railways, once controlled by unions, had no impact, as was also the case with air transport, including airport, and power.There were of course pockets - such as Kolkata, Asansol and Chennai - where there was an impact on banks and insurance companies.After banks, coal and mines and oil and gas with around 19% absenteeism in both came next, followed by insurance (16%). But it was not significant to affect operations. In any case, with the use of electronic clearing and fund transfer and ATMs, bank strikes are no longer as disruptive for citizens as they were in the past.The numbers in most cities indicate that the unions have lost their appeal among workers. More than 200 unions from industries as diverse as defence and oil and gas to several banks and ports decided against participating in the nationwide strike.The strike was called against the four labour codes enacted by the Centre, which have not yet been implemented as states are still in dialogue.What has hurt the unions attempts to mobilise workers is states moving ahead and amending their labour laws to provide significant relaxations across multiple provisions - from allowing women to work in night shifts to raising the retrenchment threshold without govt approval from 100 to 300 workers.Besides, only a handful of states have not responded on the labour codes, and that too for political reasons, as most of them chase investments, where companies often seek flexibility and lower inspector raj.","The banking sector saw the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.

"3 plants are killing us, why bring another WTE unit, asks Sannoth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-plants-are-killing-us-why-bring-another-wte-unit-asks-sannoth/articleshow/122377187.cms,"Villagers say a waste landfill, which has been growing for 12 years, is a major source of pollution

NEW DELHI: The air in Sannoth, a village next to Bawana industrial area in north Delhi, stings before it suffocates. By the time you walk past a large landfill, which has grown over the past 12 years, cross a stinking sewer that once used to be a clean natural drain towards Munak Canal, your throat itches and your eyes burn. Locals say this is the new normal.Sannoth, once known for health-conscious people and yoga practitioners, now lives with asthma inhalers, skin diseases and dyspnea.The region already has three plants to manage Delhi’s piling solid waste, chunks of which are often set afire, sending smoke into homes. However, villages are now bracing for a new waste-to-energy (WTE) plant recently cleared by the Union environment ministry.he villagers have been protesting against the newly sanctioned M/s Jindal Urban Waste Management (Bawana) Limited since Dec last year. Their concern is existential. “How can they bring another WTE plant when three such waste management facilities are already killing us slowly? We are seeing our loved ones dying, children cough and often struggle to breathe while playing,” Rajpal Saini, 70, a Sannoth resident.People can’t do yoga anymore, can’t sit outside, can’t go for long walks. The monsoon, a season that once would refill the ponds and channels and increase greenery, has become a nightmare as an intense foul odour fills the air,” said Saini, who retired from MCD’s sanitation department and has since dedicated his life to probing and exposing the environmental impact of waste processing in the area.The new plant is to come up between between the Munak Canal, which feeds half of the city with drinking water, and the landfill — a private storage and treatment facility of hazardous waste.A visit byto the area paints a grim picture of environmental degradation and a community grappling with a worsening health crisis. Yet, the plant’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) appears to side-step or downplay these realities — especially the proximity of dense human settlements and the precarious state of the natural stream slicing through the project site.sent queries to the Jindal group to find out how were they going to address the environmental concerns. However, no reply was received despite repeated attempts.Despite sustained local protests, the project secured environmental clearance. However, as the MoEFCC gave environmental clearance to the project on June 18, fears of a spike in contamination echo louder, given the condition of a similar facility in Okhla.“Our elders who died about a decade back were the last ones to die a natural death. Ever since that landfill started to grow taller, garbage being brought to this area in trucks, and a waste-to-energy plant was established, we witnessed diseases engulfing this and neighbouring villages. Swarms of big colourful flies, foul smell and itchy eyes are common. Now that a new WTE plant, a large one, has been proposed, we have no other option but to protest,” said Saini.Munesh, another resident of Sanoth, pointed towards her son, 23-yearold Ayush, who has an intellectual disability, and said that for the past five years he faced difficulty breathing, and the situation worsened every year. “Ever since the issue started, the seizures increased,” said Munesh.Similar concerns were echoed by Parvinder, father of 12-year-old Akshita, who often gets restless and gasps for air.“Some 12 years back, next to a natural pond, they started bringing and dumping waste to set up a private plant. Soon, a natural drain that passed through that site started getting murkier dark water. The air quality of the village worsened. We remember that while playing cricket as children, people would take sips from this channel. Now, we worry for the Munak Canal, which passes right next to the proposed site,” said Chand Narwal, who was joined by a retired Delhi Police constable Balraj, who echoed the same concerns.“My wife died three years back due to lung disease, and I got asthma,” said Brahm Prakash, a villager who retired from DTC.Saini further pointed out that the proposed project site had over 80 trees which villagers numbered, and that the project might impact a population larger than expected. “The EC was granted without proper fieldwork and the impact to human life due to already existing plants was avoided. No one ever visited the villages. They didn’t even consider public views which were sought by the Delhi govt. We even found that about 30 responses in favour of the plant were from JJ cluster, who were not even aware of the plant,” said Saini.When TOI contacted some of the 30 JJ colony residents who signed a handwritten letter in favour of the plant, they claimed that they were misguided. “Two men came to the colony and told that a water plant is being set up and that I will get a job there. So, I signed the letter supporting that factory. Later, we came to know that it’s a plant to burn garbage,” said Tufail Khan, a resident of JJ colony. Md Sahid Alam, another resident, tells a similar story.“The so-called public hearing was a complete farce, a disorganised, harassing charade that shifted venues multiple times, silenced residents, failed to record any objections or minutes, and rushed through before locals could even file their written submissions. To top it off, multiple letters favouring the plant, all in identical handwriting, expose a blatantly duplicitous attempt to manipulate public sentiment. Above that, toxic emissions and ash from the already existing plant and landfill have already led to skyrocketing rates of respiratory, kidney and cancerrelated illnesses among villagers, so approving another incinerator here is nothing short of environmental and health betrayal,” said environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari.","Sannoth, once known for health-conscious people and yoga practitioners, now lives with asthma inhalers, skin diseases and dyspnea.

NEW DELHI: An expert committee, appointed by central biotech regulator to review biosafety data of transgenic cotton, has submitted a favourable report on genetically modified HTBt cotton, paving way for Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to take a final call on its commercial cultivation.Though transgenic Bt cotton is being cultivated in the country after getting approved in 2002, the herbicide-tolerant Bt (HTBt) cotton could not get the mandatory GEAC nod despite long-pending demand of cotton farmers. As a result, its illegal variant is reportedly being used without quality check in many cotton-producing states.Sources said the expert committee's report has given an all clear to HTBt cotton but the final decision would be taken by govt after getting regulator GEAC's nod.The demand for legal use of HTBt is expected to be raised again on Friday when Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visits Coimbatore for a crop-specific meeting on cotton.Since the ministry has invited suggestions from farmers ahead of the meeting amid reports of declining Bt cotton productivity in the country due to a newly emerging disease, tobacco streak virus (TSV), demand for allowing another transgenic variety - HTBt - for commercial cultivation at the earliest is expected to be the key takeaway.","HTBt cotton could not get mandatory GEAC nod despite long-pending demand of cotton farmers.

"Ahead of civic polls, Telangana cabinet clears 42% quota",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-civic-polls-telangana-cabinet-clears-42-quota/articleshow/122377126.cms,"HYDERABAD: A cabinet meeting of the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt in Telangana approved Thursday a proposal to grant 42% reservation to Backward Classes (BCs) in local bodies - just in time for panchayat elections within three months, as mandated by a June 25 high court directive. The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.The reservation percentage is based on empirical data from the caste survey conducted by the state govt and submitted to the BC Commission headed by Busani Venkateshwara Rao. Based on Supreme Court's verdict permitting sub-classification of groups entitled to reservation, the cabinet had approved amendments to the Panchayat Raj Act, 2018, as precursor to raising the quota for Backwards Classes.With governor Jishnu Dev Varma proroguing the assembly and legislative council sessions on Thursday, the state govt now has the constitutional window to issue the relevant ordinance.The cabinet made the decision after consulting legal experts and the advocate general, who was present at the meeting, sources said. Revenue minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy & BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar said an ordinance was key to avoid delays & legal complications.""Per Rahul Gandhi's promise, Congress conducted a caste survey after coming to power. Two bills providing 42% reservation for BCs in education, employment, and local bodies were passed in the assembly and sent to the governor. But the Centre has been raising queries, stalling constitutional amendments needed for quota implementation. This ordinance reflects our firm commitment to BC political upliftment,"" Srinivas Reddy said.Ponnam said panchayat elections would be held by Sept 30, the deadline set by HC. ""We stand by our BC declaration made in Kamareddy. We urge all parties to support this reservation for the smooth conduct of panchayat elections,"" he said.On concerns over SC's 50% cap on total reservations, Ponnam argued that it had already been breached through the Centre's EWS quota, while Tamil Nadu currently has over 60% reservation. He said BCs constitute 56% of Telangana's population, which justifies 42% reservation for them.","The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

BENGALURU: In an apartment complex bustling with software professionals and startup entrepreneurs, no one expected a thief to be living right next door. But residents of GM Infinity in Electronics City Phase 2 were left stunned when police arrested a 26-year-old man for pulling off a string of high-value thefts right under their noses.The accused is Nitesh Subbu, an unemployed graduate from West Bengal, who had been staying with his sister in the same apartment at Thirupalya. Police recovered around 641 grams of gold and 56 grams of silver ornaments, altogether worth Rs 60.4 lakh.Subbu, who previously worked as an assistant in a real estate firm, targeted three locked flats in the apartment.On the night of July 3, he broke into the house of professor Suresh Iyer, 62, who works at Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Suresh's nephew filed a complaint with Hebbagodi police on June 5. Since her uncle had been working in Dehradun for the last four months, the house was locked, and his wife used to come to Bengaluru once in a few days. She locked the house on June 21 and went back to Dehradun. On June 4, Suresh's wife received a call from a neighbour, who informed her that the front door of their house on the second floor was broken. She asked her nephew to rush to the house and check for valuables.Subbu's sister stays in the adjacent block of Suresh's. He broke open the main door, the wardrobe slide door, and the cupboard in the bedroom to steal gold and diamond ornaments.Police inspector Somashekar G and his team verified the CCTV camera footage and found a man wearing a T-shirt and shorts searching for something in front of a few flats. When detained for interrogation on Monday, Subbu confessed to the crime.Ring the bell and then search for keySubbu would ring the doorbell of the flat he is planning to target. If someone opens the door, he would give some excuses and leave. If there is no response, he would search for the key in the shoe rack or flowerpots. If he doesn't find the key, he breaks open the door using an iron rod.Subbu committed similar thefts in two houses on the night of June 22. Police recovered the booty, including 621 grams of gold, 15.8 grams of diamond, 4.3 grams of platinum, 56 grams of silver, and Rs 28,000.","Nitesh Subbu, an unemployed graduate from West Bengal, was arrested.

""We found that Ahmed didn't have the required license from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to keep the dogs as pets. We will record Devi's statement once her health permits, and more criminal sections could be added in the case, if needed.""He added that following incidents of attacks on people by pet dogs of dangerous breeds, the department of animal husbandry and dairy under the Central govt had earlier banned the import or breeding of dogs of certain breeds deemed dangerous, including Rottweiler, Cane Corso, Kangal, Pitbull, Pitbull Terrier, Dogo Argentino and Wolfdog.""If any resident in the city is experiencing problems due to dogs of these breeds kept as pet by people in his/her neighbourhood, then they can inform police by calling the emergency number of 112, nearby police station or the DMC office for necessary action,"" added Singh.The incident has created widespread outrage in the local community.Residents and corporator Sanjay Nautiyal met Singh and mayor Saurabh Thapliyal to demand strict legal action against Ahmed and Zaid, noting that the same dogs had allegedly attacked four other people previously.Nautiyal told TOI, ""In earlier instances, Ahmed either threatened the victims or arranged settlements to avoid police complaints. This time, too, he dismissed their concerns, daring them to take action.""","Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones.

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","New tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges.

KANPUR: An eight-year-old boy's courtroom testimony against his mother led to her conviction and death sentence for murdering his three younger brothers by drowning them in a river after sedating them with spiked food at the behest of her lover in Uttar Pradesh's Auraiya last year.""A woman who can kill her children does not have the right to live in society,"" additional district and sessions judge Saif Ahmed said Thursday. Judge Ahmed called it a ""rarest of rare"" crime and handed 30-year-old Priyanka death penalty and a Rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons, aged six, four, and 18 months. Her partner Ashish - who is her dead husband's nephew - was sentenced to life in prison and fined Rs 1 lakh.Investigators said Ashish told Priyanka he would only be with her if she ""got rid of the children"". Priyanka took her four sons to Sengur riverbank in Devarpur after a quarrel with Ashish on June 27, 2024. She had drugged the children and threw them one by one into the water. Locals managed to rescue the eldest boy, who regained consciousness and later testified against his mother. The bodies of the younger boys were found soon after.Police arrested Priyanka and Ashish the next day. During trial, the son's eyewitness account and statements from six others, including Priyanka's brother-in-law, proved crucial for prosecution.""Court classified the crime 'rarest of rare' after it was established beyond doubt that the woman intentionally drowned her children.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) notified Srinagar district authorities Thursday that it will observe July 13 as Martyrs’ Day, reigniting political contention over the region’s historical memory and post-Article 370 identity.The date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K.NC also appealed to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha to reinstate July 13 and Dec 5 as public holidays. Both dates were struck off J&K’s official holiday calendar in Jan 2020, six months after the abrogation of Article 370. Until then, July 13 had been observed annually as Martyrs’ Day, while Dec 5 marked the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.In a letter to the Srinagar DC, NC said party president Farooq Abdullah and senior functionaries will visit martyrs’ graveyard in the city’s old quarters Sunday morning to lay floral tributes. NC requested security arrangements for the 8am visit.Opposition PDP president Mehbooba Mufti criticised NC’s move, saying the initiative lacked credibility. “Omar Abdullah-led govt’s proposal to the LG would have carried weight had the Speaker supported PDP’s resolution on the matter in the assembly,” she said, referring to the Speaker’s rejection of PDP’s proposal in March.“By dropping PDP’s July 13 Martyrs’ Day resolution, J&K assembly has exposed NC’s double-speak on Kashmir’s history. Their silence proves complicity, not commitment,” Mehbooba said.Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari also weighed in, urging Union govt to officially declare July 13 as Martyrs’ Day. He said his party would visit the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib to pay respect and had already sought permission from authorities.Bukhari used the moment to press for a revision of domicile laws. Addressing CM Abdullah directly, he demanded that the eligibility for J&K domicile be raised from 15 to 50 years of residency.“This is entirely within your authority and discretion. I urge you with folded hands, please, at the very least, do this much for the people of J&K,” he said.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah’s National Conference will observe July 13 as Martyrs’ Day.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court stayed Thursday the release of 'Udaipur Files' in a rare instance of judicial intervention to pause a movie on the eve of its pan-India opening, reports Abhinav Garg. The film is purportedly based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal's 2022 murder in Udaipur.The court directed Islamic cleric body Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and other petitioners, which have objected to the movie, to seek a review of its censor certificate. The division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Anish Dayal directed the petitioners to approach the Centre within two days with their grievance. Until the Centre takes a call on their revision plea, the film will not be released, the bench said.Kanhaiya Lal was murdered in June 2022 for allegedly sharing a social media post in support of former BJP functionary Nupur Sharma after her controversial comments on Prophet Mohammed.NIA arrested alleged assassins Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous. Their trial is pending. The judges pointed “that it is not impermissible for this court to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction even in a case where a petitioner has not exhausted its alternative statutory remedies”.“But having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case… especially the processes to be gone into at the time of grant of certification, we are of the opinion that the petitioner ought to approach the central govt by invoking Section 6 of the (Cinematograph) Act (which deals with revisional powers vested with the central govt),” the high court said.During the hearing, petitioners’ senior counsel Kapil Sibal described the film as “the worst form of hate speech” against a community and an “imminent threat to public order and harmony”. He told the bench he had watched the film in a private screening, as directed by the court. He cited some instances and dialogues to argue the movie was “not art but cinematic vandalism” to vilify a community. Among the scenes Sibal highlighted was one showing arrests of Muslim students.In contrast, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, justified the censor board’s nod and contended that it was a movie based on a crime, not any community. “The film cautions people. It is a crime-specific film. We should all live together — that’s the theme,” Chetan Sharma argued.",Delhi high court stays release of 'Udaipur Files' in a rare instance of judicial intervention to pause a movie on the eve of its pan-India opening.

""Indira Gandhi's harshness led public life into fear. Indira insisted that only an Emergency could bring discipline to the country. Outside world was unaware of the torture in detention and the murders without trial,"" he wrote.He said Sanjay's actions were extremely brutal and facilitated by the then govt, and people expressed their anger by ousting Indira and her party in the elections in 1977. Tharoor said today's India is democratic and has gained more confidence and progress. ""For 21 long months, fundamental rights were suspended, the press was muzzled, and political dissent was brutally suppressed.The world's largest democracy held its breath, as the very essence of its constitutional promise - liberty, equality, fraternity - was severely tested,"" he said.Tharoor's article appeared to stir the pot again, given that he has been publicly at odds with Congress on several issues. Recently, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge slammed him for putting ""Modi first"" as against Congress' policy of putting ""India first"".

Rs 2.9 crore Bengaluru drive to serve strays chicken rice stirs row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2-9-crore-bengaluru-drive-to-serve-strays-chicken-rice-stirs-row/articleshow/122376570.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Chicken rice, taxpayer money, and street dogs are set to converge in an unprecedented Rs 2.9 crore initiative by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which will soon roll out a daily feeding programme for stray dogs. The aim: to tame dog aggression and enhance public safety - and possibly, urban chaos.Starting with 5,000 strays across the city's eight zones, the municipal corporation will deliver one meal a day of 367 grams - a calorie-calibrated mix designed to meet the nutritional needs of a typical 15kg dog. Each Rs 22.42 meal includes: 150g chicken (protein); 100g rice (carbohydrates); 100g vegetables (minerals); 10g oil (fats). This will provide 465-750 kcal of energy.Bengaluru has an estimated 2.8 lakh stray dogs. A trial run has already been conducted ahead of the launch, BBMP officials said. Around 500 animal-welfare volunteers currently feed around 25,000 dogs across the city.BBMP will now onboard designated vendors to feed selected dogs - 400 to 500 for each zone - at 100 to 125 feeding points in a zone. Cleanliness at feeding sites will be part of the contract, said animal husbandry commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishore.Voluntary citizen participation is encouraged, with residents invited to contribute financially to the feeding efforts alongside BBMP. ""This is the first time a municipal body in India has taken up scheduled mass feeding of stray animals,"" said a senior BBMP official. ""It's not just a welfare step - it's a safety initiative.""But the move has sharply divided opinion. While animal rights activists have praised the plan, critics question the wisdom of allocating crores in public funds to feed dogs instead of curbing their population through sterilisation. ""My elderly father was chased by stray dogs just last week. Instead of spending crores on chicken rice, BBMP should focus on sterilising and controlling the dog population first. Feeding is not the solution,"" said Sowmya Ramesh, a resident.Kiran Raj from Hulimavu offered a counterpoint: ""Many of us already feed stray dogs with our own money. If BBMP is stepping in to help, it can make a big difference - provided it's done responsibly and without corruption.""","Bengaluru municipal corporation will deliver one meal a day of 367 grams.

He was speaking at a high-level workshop on ease of doing business and investment promotion where several states participated.During the session on decriminalisation and compliance reform, several states presented their ongoing initiatives arising from Jan Vishwas Act 1.0, highlighting efforts to decriminalise minor business-related offences at state level. The discussion stressed the need to convert minor business offences into civil penalties, while also streamlining compliance mechanisms to reduce the burden on entrepreneurs, said an official statement.States shared examples of removing imprisonment clauses, adopting self-certification regimes, removal of licence renewal and simplifying regulatory touchpoints to encourage ease of compliance and build trust with businesses.Industry representatives also suggested introduction of a trusted taxpayers programme for both direct and indirect taxes, to incentivise compliance and promote a more facilitative regulatory environment.B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, Niti Aayog, underscored the role of state-level execution in shaping the country's overall investment climate. He emphasised that there is much to learn from within the country, citing diversity of successful models across states.

Senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Congress and other opposition parties, said EC was undertaking a citizenship screening exercise. He said voters in the list were presumed to be citizens of the country and that presumption could not be taken away by the EC.Echoing him, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for RJD neta Manoj Jha, said there was a procedure under Citizenship Act which had to be followed in deciding citizenship disputes and a person who participated in more than 10 elections since 2003 could not be doubted not to be a citizen without any proof to the contrary.They said the SC ruling and guidelines framed in 1995 in Lal Babu Hussein case were not being followed by EC.

Denied promotions, Varinderjit retired in 2018 at same position he was hired in

PATIALA: A local court here has ordered the attachment of the municipal corporation's office building, the civic commissioner's official car and office assets, including furniture, computers, printers, fans and ACs, for failing to clear Rs 3.2 lakh dues to the family of a deceased Class IV employee. The bailiff is to execute the warrant by July 23.The court set the next hearing for July 27, with an order to the corporation to clear the dues or face further action, including potential auction of the attached properties.The order was passed by the civil judge (junior division), Patiala.Advocate Puneet Sharma, who represented the petitioner, said the deceased employee, Varinderjit Singh, was recruited in 2000 but dismissed in 2001 due to a pending case. After a prolonged legal battle, Punjab and Haryana high court ruled in his favour in 2017 and ordered the civic body to reinstate him and pay him allowances and interest retrospectively for the period he was removed from service.The corporation moved Supreme Court, where its appeal was dismissed, and it had to reinstate Varinderjit. His lawyer contended that Varinderjit was denied promotions and proficiency step-up benefits, forcing him to retire in 2018 at the same position where he was hired.Varinderjit passed away in 2021, leaving his adopted son, Samanjot Singh, to fight for the unpaid dues.Despite repeated orders, the corporation released only a partial payment of Rs 60,485 as principal, leaving over Rs 3.2 lakh, including interest, unpaid. On July 2, the court issued a final warning to the corporation, which went unheeded, leading to Wednesday's order.The court set the next hearing for July 27, with an order to the corporation to clear the dues or face further action, including potential auction of attached properties. ""The court's decision sends a strong message to govt bodies that flouting orders will have serious consequences. If dues remain unpaid, the court may order sale of attached properties,"" said advocate Sharma.Civic commissioner Paramvir Singh said, ""Our legal team is looking into the matter. As per the legal team, the court has issued a warrant of attachment and not attached the property.""In addition to the corporation building and the commissioner's car, the court has ordered the attachment of office assets that include 20 fans, 30 chairs, four coolers, three ACs, 10 almirahs, five tables, four computers, and three printers.","A local court has ordered the attachment of the municipal corporation's office building, the civic commissioner's official car and office assets.

Though the court flagged the practical difficulty in completing the task within the short timeline as it was tied to the state polls, EC assured 60% of the work was already done.Noting that EC itself accepted that the list of 11 approved documents was not an exhaustive one, a bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi said it was prima facie of the view that the commission should also consider Aadhaar and the other two documents. It said Aadhaar was already considered a relevant identity document for electoral rolls.The court, however, twice clarified that it was not a direction but a suggestion to the EC which could be discarded but for which the panel has to give reasons.Initially, the court was in favour of restraining EC from publishing draft rolls which is scheduled for August 1 but it refrained from doing so after the commission strongly opposed it.Thereafter, the court posted the hearing for July 28 to take stock of the situation before publication of draft rolls.The bench said in its order it was Priima facie of the opinion that there were three questions which needed to be examined in the case — power of EC to conduct the process; the procedure to exercise the power; and the timeline which was very short as Bihar elections are due in November.The court witnessed two-and-ahalf hours of intense arguments with senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan, Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Shadan Farasat challenging the validity of EC’s decision. The high-stakes legal duel saw the poll panel fielding senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh along with former attorney general K K Venugopal to justify the decision.During the hearing, SC said while EC was discharging its constitutional duty and it was not doubting the commission’s effort and sincerity, there was an issue of perception and practical difficulties which had to be examined. It questioned why the process started so late and why it was linked with the Bihar assembly election which is to take place in November. Dwivedi said being a constitutional body like judiciary, the EC could not answer about perception but only on law and there was no illegality.“If you ask me, then I would not be able to furnish those documents. You are talking about law but I am talking about practicality,” Justice Dhulia said. Dwivedi further said EC could not and does not intend to remove people from the list and a wrong perception was being created against the exercise because of a premeditated mindset.But the bench asked why EC took the decision suddenly and why it was related to the Nov election. “We appreciate the exercise done by you. Nobody disputes that. But with such a big population, is it possible to link the exercise to the ensuing election... We have serious doubts whether you will meet the timeline. It is not practical,” the bench said.Trying to dispel the court’s doubt, Dwivedi said the exercise was going on in full swing, and 60% of the work was already done. He said political parties were also helping in the exercise. He successfully prodded the court not to pass any interim order and to list the case days before publication of draft rolls to take stock of the situation.The court issued notice to EC on the batch of petitions filed by opposition parties — Congress, NCP (SP), CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), DMK, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena (UBT), JMM, RJD and TMC. In addition, Yogendra Yadav, NGOs Association for Democratic Reforms and People’s Union for Civil Liberties, and a few residents of Bihar have also filed petitions against the poll panel’s decision.","The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to consider accepting Aadhaar, voter ID card and ration card as valid documents for its special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.

SRINAGAR: As political parties in Kashmir continue to raise concerns over “demographic change” and the opening of liquor shops in the Valley, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Thursday slammed such comments, asserting that these narratives echoed those of terrorist groups like The Resistance Front (TRF).“Some people are giving irresponsible statements that guests are spoiling the culture of J&K. They are stating there is a demographic invasion, and that alcoholism is spreading,” Sinha said.“This is a narrative similar to that of terror outfit TRF. I appeal to those making such statements to stop peddling such a narrative.

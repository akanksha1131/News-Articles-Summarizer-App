'Both had to do something in India': Congress leader claims CIA–Mossad behind 2014 rout; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/both-had-to-do-something-in-india-congress-leader-claims-ciamossad-behind-2014-rout-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/125628214.cms,"Here's what former Congress MP said



What BJP said



NEW DELHI: Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in war of words after the grand old party's former MP claimed meddling by US and Israel intelligence agencies in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. Kumar Ketkar blamed Mossad and CIA for the Congress party's loss.BJP MP Sambit Patra, in turn, quipped saying that the Congress lost because ""Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI"" carried forward its ""agenda in India"".The former Rajya Sabha MP noted that the party secured 145 Lok Sabha seats in 2004 and increased its tally to 206 in the 2009 general election. If that trajectory had continued, he argued, the Congress might have reached around 250 seats and easily held on to power. Instead, the party’s seat count plunged to 44 in 2014, he observed.""There were organisations that acted in a way that 'till the time we do not bring down the Congress from 206, we would not be able to play games here (in India),"" he said.""One of the organisations was the CIA and another was the Mossad of Israel. Both had decided that they had to do something in India. If a stable Congress government or a Congress-led alliance government came back to power again, they would not have been able to interfere in India and implement their policies,"" he added.""The Mossad prepared detailed data on states and constituencies. The CIA and the Mossad have detailed data on states and constituencies,"" the former journalist said.The BJP countered Congress leader Ketkar’s allegation, insisting that its victories come from the support of ""the people, not foreign intelligence agencies"".""Neither the CIA nor the Mossad makes the BJP win. It is the people who make the BJP win. Those who get gas cylinders and housing, as well as the poor, farmers, women and youth, make the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win,"" he said.""If you will work on the ISI’s blueprint, seek to reconstruct the Babri mosque, oppose Ram temple… If the Congress follows the ISI agenda, how will it progress?"" the BJP leader told reporters at the party headquarters,"" he added.","Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in war of words after the grand old party's former MP claimed meddling by US and Israel intelligence agencies.

How Ahmedabad’s planning to turn CWG into Olympic leap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-ahmedabads-planning-to-turn-cwg-into-olympic-leap/articleshow/125627441.cms,".

Confirmation of Ahmedabad as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games (CWG) has sounded the starting gun for an accelerated infrastructure race across the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar belt. The Commonwealth Sport General Assembly’s approval on Wednesday has pushed the twin cities into delivery mode, with officials stressing that major venue construction plans are locked into a firm timeline.Speaking to the media in Glasgow after Ahmedabad won hosting rights, Gujarat principal secretary (sports, youth and cultural activities) Ashwani Kumar said that the city is poised to be the sports capital of India. “The construction of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave (SVPSE) and the Police Academy Sports Hub will begin in April 2026 and finish by late 2028 or early 2029,” he said.He announced that funding for both these projects had been secured by the govt and that “most venues for the 2030 Games are ready”. He also said that the “organising committee will be constituted within a month”.Much of the Games’ footprint will be centred on the SVPSE — a purpose-built zone that will anchor Gujarat’s longterm sporting ecosystem.The enclave will house an arena, aquatic centre, tennis courts, training zones, and athlete villages. The Karai Police Academy complex will host athletics, shooting and other disciplines. For Gujarat, the CWG is as much about global visibility as about creating infrastructural and sporting capacity that endures beyond 2030.Unlike some sporting meets that span multiple states, the 2030 Games will be strikingly compact, concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster. That will enable faster movement and a lower carbon footprint. “This compactness cuts athlete travel time and allows seamless integration of metro, BRTS and electric mobility,” states the document, ‘Games Vision, Concept and Legacy — Commonwealth Games 2030’, presented before the CWG committee. Only two disciplines — cycling at the Statue of Unity (near Kevadia) and women’s cricket in Vadodara — will take place outside this hub.The Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2030 Games — massive productions that are expected to reflect the Commonwealth Sport values.Beyond the Games, Gujarat — which hosted the National Games in 2022 — is pushing lesser-known disciplines like netball, lawn bowls, kabaddi, and yogasana into the spotlight. The bigger shift is strategic — Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar aim to become year round sports cities, with high performance labs, community spaces and university-linked infrastructure to ensure post Games utilisation.Ahmedabad also plans to discuss sustainability, diversity and inclusion during the Commonwealth heads of govt meeting (CHOGM) 2026 and 2028.Tejas Joshi, president of Credai Gujarat, said, “Hosting the CWG will be a game changer for Ahmedabad. The city’s infrastructure will see a drastic change with improved roads and connectivity. It will create demand for around 20,000 star-category hotel rooms and boost hotel and retail development. It will also eventually bring new migration to the city, resulting in increased housing demand.”Accommodation is expanding fast. “Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar offer 5,420 hotel rooms in the 3-5 star range, with 3,000 more planned, including 1,500 new 5-star rooms. Upgraded university hostels will house athletes during the Games and serve students later,” states the proposal.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport, handling 13.4 million passengers annually, will add a new terminal by 2026 to double its capacity and introduce e-gates and kiosks.“World-class sports academies will be set up, encouraging a sports culture among city youths. After the Commonwealth Games, Ahmedabad aims to host the 2036 Olympics. The next decade will bring historic developments to the city,” said Joshi.Behind the scenes, athlete development is accelerating. Gujarat’s sports budget has grown from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 521 crore over two decades, strengthening long-term athlete development pathways and strengthening academies. Part of the focus is also on scaling up talent hunts like Khel Mahakumbh, which saw engagement from 7 million participants, and schemes such as Shaktidoot to support athletes.Public participation will also be a defining layer. Programmes like Active Gujarat will convert riverfronts and parks into fitness zones. At the same time, Sabarmati Sundays — weekly openstreet events — will be expanded in the run-up to 2030. College students will join as youth ambassadors through the National Service Scheme (NSS) and the National Cadet Corps (NCC). By 2030, Gujarat plans to train 10,000 volunteers and create over 30,000 jobs linked to the Games.","Ahmedabad has been confirmed as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games. The Games will be concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster. The Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2030 Games.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125627487,imgsize-908548,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
SC to govt: Consider law to curb ridiculing of disabled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-govt-consider-law-to-curb-ridiculing-of-disabled/articleshow/125626753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to deter ridiculing of differently abled people, but the Union govt flagged the potential adverse impact of such legislation on creative artists depicting individuals with disability in movies and theatres.Hearing a petition by NGO Cure SMA Foundation that objected to five stand-up comedians ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and persons with disability in different shows, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, “Why don’t you (Union govt) bring a stringent legislation like SC/ST Act? It criminalises ridiculing the depressed, deprived and discriminated class of citizens. A similar law to protect persons with disability could be considered for enactment.”Mehta, sharing the court’s concern, said he would discuss it with the authorities but flagged the point that such a legislation might create a problem for artists who play characters, for example dumb and blind, in movies, theatres and dramas. They may evoke humour but also seek to depict in a larger sense the difficulties they face in society, he said.Appearing for the NGO, senior advocate Aparajita Singh said the organisation arranges for treatment of SMA patients mainly through crowd funding, which was affected because of a stand-up comedian’s disparaging remarks on cost of treatment. She said that a decision to allow corporate entities to donate CSR funds for treatment of SMA patients would go a long way in mitigating their suffering.When the court said the govt should create a corpus for treatment of SMA patients, Mehta said the Centre already has a scheme through which treatments up to Rs 50 lakh are borne by the exchequer. However, in one case, which was before SC, the treatment cost Rs 16 crore, a huge sum which the govt felt could be utilised to treat many more patients. “There is a platform for corporate CSR donations,” he said.Whan Samay Raina’s counsel said the stand-up comedian, who was hauled up by the court for his disparaging remarks against SMA patients along with others of his tribe who had ridiculed disability, had contributed Rs 2.5 lakh to SMA, Singh said the NGO does not need his money. She said if he could atone for his mistake by hosting achievers with SMA, it would send a positive message in society and make the public aware of the degenerative disease.Singh gave the names of 11 outstanding achievers — IITians, computer professionals working with Google and Microsoft, acclaimed author, academicians, filmmaker, doctors and sportsman — who suffer from SMA, and suggested these persons are hosted on comedians’ digital shows to spread the message in society.The bench agreed and asked the comedians to host two shows every month featuring the achievers with SMA and disability and contribute the earnings towards treatment of differently abled and SMA patients. “We are putting a social burden on you instead of punishing you,” CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said.",Supreme Court suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ), which now fully secures the Parliament House complex (PHC), has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament security duty, which may be further stretched by a year. The move is aimed at striking the right balance between operational continuity, so as to enhance familiarity of personnel with members of Parliament, and the former’s optimum rotation for steady infusion of new blood.As per CISF’s general posting norms, its personnel are allowed a maximum three-year tenure in a given place of posting, though this may be extended. The revised posting policy specific to PHC security duties will ensure that a fixed proportion of the sanctioned strength is changed every year. The extended tenure will also strengthen familiarity of personnel with MPs and movement patterns within PHC, which is critical for ensuring accurate identification, secure access protocols and layered threat detection and response.The updated CISF guidelines specific to PHC security duties lay down tighter eligibility norms for gazetted officers and non-gazetted officers, with mandatory multi-stage screening. Personnel detailed for PHC duties must possess a clean service record, be in top shape-1 medical category, have no disciplinary or vigilance concerns and should have completed at least 2 specialised courses conducted by the NSG and Army.",The Central Industrial Security Force has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament security duty.

Influencers sitting in countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ireland and Singapore and having nothing to do with India are setting narratives here, he said, adding that many of these handles using Indian names are unlikely to have a real identity. ""Rahul Gandhi does not only speak against India from abroad. He sets narratives against India by planning and design,"" Patra said.BJP later posted, ""X's new 'Location Display' feature has uncovered a staggering revelation: dozens of Congress-Left ecosystem accounts spreading anti-India narratives are not even in India. This is a coordinated foreign influence campaign targeting India's democracy, security, and unity.""Congress dismissed the charge as BJP's diversionary tactic, and alleged that some accounts linked to the governing party are based abroad too. It can be due to a host of technical reasons, including due to the use of VPN and temporary travel, the opposition party said.X's decision to display the location and identity of its users set political circles aflutter earlier this week as handles belonging to some of trenchant ""Indian"" critics of Modi, who had an active presence on the platform, turned out to be Pakistani.","BJP claims foreign-based influencers in league with Congress are behind promoting anti-govt narratives.

SC: Need to pre-screen social media content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-need-to-pre-screen-social-media-content/articleshow/125626640.cms,"‘Right to free speech must be given the widest width.

'Spur Of The Moment’: Former CJI Gavai Reacts To Shoe-Attack Attempt, Reveals Why He Took No Action

SC: Issue is social media content that goes viral before pull-down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told the information and broadcasting ministry to prepare a draft mechanism for screening of user-generated content (UGC) prior to its uploading on social media, realising its vast potential to cause social upheaval before being taken down.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Right to freedom of speech is very important but a regulated right. It is not absolute as the First Amendment Rights in the US. Self-regulatory codes may not work in case of UGC. If anti-national content is uploaded on social media, by the time the govt notices it and orders its takedown, a day or two may pass, during which period it would go viral and cause damage to, or unrest in, society. ”The bench said, “We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech. We are on a reasonable preventive mechanism, not to throttle but sieve content on social media prior to uploading. AI provides enormous potential to curate content. Some content may be academic yet... scurrilous. Today there is a statutory vacuum in this regard which needs to be filled.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan protested use of the word “anti-national” and said it is subjectively and selectively defined by authorities.The SC bench said, “Forget the definition of anti-national. If someone posts a video claiming parts of India with a neighbouring country, will it not be termed anti-national?”Bhushan differed. He asked, “If I question the accession of Sikkim to India, it is a mere viewpoint and cannot be termed anti-national.If I discuss China claiming parts of India’s territory, would it be anti-national?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested loudly & said Bhushan should not instigate secession in a judicial proceeding related to curbing uploading of obscene, perverse & anti-national content on social media.CJI Kant said, “There was a case before us during Operation Sindoor. A person uploaded a video claiming he was with Pakistan and praised another country for helping Pakistan. When the matter came before the court, he simply said he had deleted the post within an hour of posting it. But in this age, the moment such content gets posted on social media, it immediately goes viral and there is no mechanism to prevent uploading of such content. ”“Right to free speech must be given the widest width. But in the case of content on social media, prosecution is a post-occurrence proceeding. There should be preventive mechanisms to stop spreading misinformation and damage to society,” the bench said.When two associations of broadcasters, OTTs and digital channels said they have self-regulatory codes and that there is no need for pre-censorship of content, the bench asked, “If the self-regulatory code is working, why is such content getting posted on social media?”“A portal under self-regulation cannot decide whether content is damaging to society, obscene or outrageous. We can’t also give that regulatory power to the govt, but to an autonomous body. Speaking against the govt is not anti-national activity. That is a precious democratic right. But the problem is with certain content on social media which goes viral prior to these being taken down,” the bench said.The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from the public. The bench said the court would examine the issue after the govt prepares the draft mechanism, after considering the suggestions and objections of experts and public, to scrutinise social media content prior to their uploading.Attorney general R Venkaratamani and Mehta told the court that the ministry would carry out the exercise and take public opinion on it within four weeks. The bench said that the govt should take help of domain experts, jurists and media personnel in drafting the proposed mechanism.","The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from public. ‘We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech.

Former US Rep and economist Dr Dave Brat trained the guns at India over the H-1B visa program and said that while the national cap for H-1B is 85,000, one Indian district got 220,000 H-1B visas which is 2.5 times the limit. ""When you hear H-1B, think of your family, because these fraudulent visas just stole their future,"" Dr Brat said, appearing on Steve Bannon's podcast, adding that China contributes only 12% to the H-1B program.In 2024, India's Chennai consulate reportedly processed roughly 220,000 H-1B visas and 140,000 H-4 dependent visas. The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign skill.US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui , an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.""When I say H-1B visa, you need to think of your cousins, your aunts and uncles, and your grandparents. One of these folks comes over and claims they're skilled; they're not. That's the fraud.

The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate. Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure. And their anti-fraud drive was called a 'rogue operation'.

'Animal Will Pay': Trump Erupts After 2 National Guardsmen Shot Near White House; DC In Lockdown

Two National Guard members shot near White House





Authorities have identified the suspect in the Washington DC shooting that critically injured two National Guard members near the White House.Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the accused is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021. Officials are still verifying all his details, and the motive remains unclear.Images shared online appeared to show the suspect being taken away in handcuffs after being shot and placed on a stretcher.“This is the man who opened fire on the National Guard just one day before Thanksgiving. He was taken away in handcuffs after being shot, stripped, and loaded onto a stretcher before being placed in an ambulance,"" an X user wrote, sharing the picture.The shooting happened on Wednesday afternoon when National Guard members were on “high-visibility patrols” near 17th Street and I Street NW.Police said the gunman came around a corner, raised a handgun, and fired directly at the two soldiers. Other Guard members nearby immediately responded.The White House and nearby federal buildings were briefly placed under lockdown. Mayor Muriel Bowser and FBI director Kash Patel said both soldiers are in critical condition. President Donald Trump confirmed that the suspect was also seriously injured.The FBI is treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism, and the case is being handled as an assault on federal officers. The Trump administration later ordered 500 additional National Guard troops to the city.","The suspect is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021.

Speculations over former Prime Minister Imran Khan's whereabouts are rife across Pakistan after his three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.This comes as several social media handles originating from Afghanistan and Pakistan claimed that Imran has been mysteriously killed inside Adiala Jail.According to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf members, Imran's sisters — Noreen Niazi, Aleema Khan and Dr Uzma Khan — were camped outside Adiala Jail when police personnel assaulted them ""for seeking a meeting with Imran Khan"".""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.Meanwhile, thousands of PTI supporters also gathered outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi and raised slogans against the arrest of Imran Khan.Noreen Niazi also accused the police personnel of slapping and dragging women present outside the jail.""Police's conduct was part of a broader and troubling pattern of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a troubling impunity,"" she said.""Police's conduct was wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society,"" she added.This comes as the government has put a ban on meeting Imran inside jail for over a month. The former Pakistan PM has been in jail since August 2023 in multiple cases.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was not allowed to meet Khan. Afridi made seven consecutive attempts to see him in jail, but he was denied by the jail authorities, whom Khan claims were controlled by an army officer.","Imran Khan's three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

What kind of people are they, who find it difficult to utter the two most famous slogans of the freedom struggle in the House?""She said that after 1947, 'Jai Hind' was adopted by the Indian armed forces as their official greeting, while 'Vande Mataram', besides being the national song, is a slogan that gives India the status of a mother.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Disproportionate focus on SIR/vote chori at the cost of crucial local issues of cost of living, migration and corruption was cited by some senior functionaries as a reason for the decimation of Congress in Bihar, as they urged the central leadership to fix accountability for the defeat if the party is serious about reviving itself in the state.Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners. The AIMIM was also blamed for division of minority votes in Seemanchal region and beyond. It was alleged that BJP had used a ""basket of tools"" to ""fix"" the polls which spanned SIR, EVMs, the buying of votes and use of the administration against opposition candidates. Days after the Bihar debacle, the AICC brass of Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal held a review of the poor show with poll candidates and MPs.Around 70 members met the leadership in batches. Before the meetings started and top netas arrived, two losing candidates were reported to have clashed over the reasons for the defeat - with one taking exception to the other advocating violence against ""outsiders"" who got party tickets.Some claimed that the idea of meeting the state functionaries in batches was also to avoid a potential clash in a large gathering.A politician is said to have found fault with the manner of candidate selection which, he said, cost the party heavily. He is said to have told Rahul Gandhi that just like he had taken responsibility for the defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and stepped down as party president, heads should roll in the state too - in what was a veiled jibe at AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru - an issue that was also raised by other members, sources said. A section of party members also targeted the alliance with RJD, saying the ally brings some votes but also polarises other communities. It was also demanded that Congress break the alliance with RJD. However, at one group meeting, Rahul is said to have rebuffed it by asking why the party failed on seats that witnessed ""friendly fights"" with Congress and RJD in the fray against each other.Questions were asked about the weightage given by Congress to caste census with arguments that victory of candidates from individual upper castes is vastly higher than their population share, while that from some large OBC communities is just in line with their numbers - in a veiled reference to the advocacy of ""share as per population"" slogan.","Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan..."" Sarma said, as cited by ANI.Sarma has also pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam if he is re-elected in next year’s assembly polls.""If I return to the assembly as the Chief Minister, I will bring the UCC in the first session of the assembly. I give you my commitment that I will bring the UCC to Assam,"" Sarma added.The bill was introduced amid the absence of opposition MLAs from Congress, CPI(M), and Raijor Dal, who staged a walkout following a discussion on the death of singer Zubeen Garg.The bill defines polygamy as marrying another person while either party already has a valid, existing marriage or a living spouse from whom they are not legally divorced or whose marriage has not been annulled.It states that anyone entering into a polygamous marriage will face up to seven years in prison and a fine, as specified in law.""No person shall marry, if, he has a living spouse or he is not legally separated from the other spouse following due procedure of law, after marriage, or he is a party to a marriage which is not yet dissolved or annulled by a decree of divorce and either has right to appeal or the specified time for appeal has not been expired or is in appeal, or the appeal has been presented but has not yet been dismissed,"" the bill mentions, as cited by ANI.""Whoever abets any offences punishable under this Act or attempts to commit any such offence shall be punishable with the punishment as provided under the Act for the offence of polygamy. Whoever, during the lifetime of his or her spouse or during subsistence of a valid marriage or without having been lawfully divorced from the spouse, or without having been declared the marriage null and void or dissolved, contracts a marriage contravening any of the provisions contained in the Act under Section 4 shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years and a fine,"" the bill adds.","Assam Assembly passes 'Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025' Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma says the legislation is not against Islam.

NEW DELHI: The power tussle for the top post in Karnataka Congress turned ugly on Thursday with chief minister Siddaramaiah taking open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar. Hours after Shivakumar posted a cryptic message reminding Siddaramaiah and the Congress high command to ""keep one's word and walk the talk"", the chief minister has hit back using ""word play"" to target his deputy.Earlier today, Shivakumar in a post on X wrote, ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power.""The state Congress president, who is eyeing the top post as part of a ""secret deal"" in 2023 for rotational CM following the party's sweeping victory in the assembly elections, wants Siddaramaiah to honour the commitment made then by the party leadership.Siddaramaiah, who has often asserted that he will complete his term of 5 years, made an interesting response to DKS message.

SC orders nationwide audit of all private & deemed universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-nationwide-audit-of-all-private-deemed-universities/articleshow/125624193.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ordered an unprecedented nationwide audit of all private and deemed universities, transforming a student grievance into a deep scrutiny of India’s sprawling higher education sector. In a sweeping directive, apex court has asked Centre, all states and UTs, and University Grants Commission (UGC) to submit personally sworn affidavits disclosing how these institutions were set up, who governs them, what regulatory approvals they hold, and whether they truly function on a notfor-profit basis.The move comes in response to a petition filed by a student of Amity University, Ayesha Jain, who alleged the institution harassed and barred her from attending classes after she legally changed her name. What began as a single case of administrative apathy has now turned into a judicial inquisition into the governance and financial practices of the entire private university ecosystem.Supreme Court’s focus is clear — expose the structural opacity and examine whether regulatory bodies like UGC have adequately performed their role. Past interventions show this isn’t unfamiliar terrain. In 2005, the court struck down Chhattisgarh Private Universities Act that had allowed over 100 shell institutions to operate without basic academic infrastructure.In 2009, a central review found 44 deemed universities unfit for their status due to poor academic and governance standards. In 2017, a Supreme Court verdict invalidated engineering degrees awarded via unapproved distance mode by deemed universities and barred them from conducting such courses without clear regulatory approval.This current review cuts deeper. It questions how private universities acquire land, appoint leadership, handle finances, and whether they have credible grievance redressal mechanisms. The demand for personal accountability — from chief secretaries to the UGC chairperson — signals judicial impatience with the status quo. A UGC official, on condition of anonymity, acknowledged: “There have been longstanding compliance gaps. This is a chance to restore public trust.” The official added that in the current case, the commission “in fact recommended the university to consider the name change request”.Private universities, many of which operate under different state and central laws, are rattled. “This is a sweeping brush,” said a vice chancellor of a reputed state private university. “We support transparency, but we also fear being tarred with the same brush as a few errant institutions.”Observers see timing in the court’s action. Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, intended to overhaul regulation and merge UGC, AICTE, and others under one roof, is expected in the upcoming Parliament session.“An issue concerning a private university legislated by state law is now expanded to rope in all private deemed universities governed by separate regulations under a central law. In a similar exercise, in 2017 in the case of Orissa Lift case, an issue concerning four deemed universities affected all in an irreversible manner. With HECI round the corner, it is hoped that the present issue finds a policy solution through HECI Bill,” said an academic policy expert.","Supreme Court has ordered an unprecedented nationwide audit of all private and deemed universities.

NEW DELHI: National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down a proposal from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME), Katra, seeking to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) through the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC).An NMC official said the commission did not approve the request as it would go against policy. Such decisions require broader consultation with states and stakeholders, and existing regulations cannot be amended for a single institution. Under current rules, 85% of MBBS seats are reserved for the state quota and 15% for the All-India Quota. ""This is not just about SMVDIME. Any change will have to be worked out with all states and stakeholders on board,"" the official said.The proposal may be placed before the board for further deliberation if needed, but the commission has declined it for now.The SMVDIME proposal comes at a time when the institution has found itself at the centre of controversy. Several Hindu organisations, including Sanatan Dharam Sabha and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have protested over 43 out of the first batch of 50 MBBS students reportedly being from a particular community.The groups hold that since the institute is funded by devotees of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, it should attract students from across the country rather than just one community or region.""As of now, 100% of candidates are from the state,"" an official confirmed, adding the college was seeking all-India quota allocation to widen the pool for intake of students.On Sept 8 last year, SMVDIME - located at the base camp of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine - was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats, paving the way for admissions to its first batch in the 2025-26 academic session.The institute began functioning in Nov last year from the administrative block of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.","Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence sought to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down the proposal.

'Islamophobia': Pak Meltdown Over Ayodhya Event Despite Its Own Poor Record of Minority Persecution

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: On Constitution Day, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, speaking at separate functions on Wednesday, called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution and uphold the rights of citizens.However, while CM AbdullahAddressing students and faculty at the 50th annual celebration of Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa in Jammu’s Poonch district, Omar said “propaganda and lies” were being spread against Muslim religious institutions in many parts of the country. This was unpatriotic, he added.As the programme began with the national anthem, patriotic songs and Constitutional Day pledges, the CM said, “I wish those people who spread venom against religious educational institutions through social media and the press had been here today to witness this programme. They claim that the institutions like Zia-ul-Uloom teach nothing except communalism, and only impart religious education. But you can see that along with religious studies, they teach science, mathematics and all other subjects. ”On social media, “lies are spread that these institutions promote anti-national sentiment”, where one could see here that the reality was completely different, he said.Omar said symbolic observation of Constitution Day meant nothing if its ideals were not followed.“Today, we observed Constitution Day. It does not mean we remember the Constitution just for one hour; it means we must uphold it every day. The Preamble guarantees equal rights for every religion, equal democratic rights and equality before law for all. But, we are passing through a phase where even education is being given a religious colour, where statements are made that a Muslim shouldn’t study in a medical college or that non-Hindus shouldn’t be admitted in a medical college,” the CM said.He was referring to objections raised by BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal over the admission of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra. The row erupted after only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50. The admissions were based on the NEET merit list.Omar said Zia-ul-Uloom has always supported the govt and had always helped during natural disasters. During Operation Sindoor, shells fired from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir hit the madrassa on May 7, killing a teacher and wounding three students.LG Sinha, speaking at a function held in Jammu to celebrate 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution, said that after a long wait of 67 years, all provisions of the Constitution were fully implemented in J&K, ending discrimination and injustice. He was referring to the abrogation of Article 370, which granted a special status to J&K, in August 2019.“Those who say what was achieved over the past five years, I want to tell them that the practice of rewarding separatists and torturing patriots has been stopped completely,” the LG said. “Now, J&K is moving ahead guided by ideals of equity, social and economic justice as enshrined in the Constitution by Baba Saheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.”","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","PM Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus.

When Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within GIFT City on New Year’s Eve 2023, it made national headlines. For a state where ‘dry’ has been a foundational principle since 1960, the move to create a watering hole where professionals could socialise — even if within the perimeters of India’s first international financial hub — felt audacious.Two years later, the glass remains half full, measured rather than overflowing. Official figures show 985 permanent employees with liquor access permits and 5,291 temporary ones for visitors. With 5,552 bulk litres of liquor sold to date — a modest but telling figure — Gujarat’s experiment with controlled conviviality proves that even in prohibition territory, business pragmatism can find a way.Inside GIFT City, every drink has a paper trail. Gujarat’s first taste of legal liquor operates within one of the most controlled ecosystems in the country: precise, trackable and fenced in by policy.Only those employed with registered firms in GIFT City can raise a glass — and only after securing a two-year access permit, renewable for Rs 1,000 annually. Visitors can join in, but only through one-day temporary permits issued by an authorised recommending officer.Each permit holder is allowed to host up to five guests at a time within licensed ‘wine and dine’ zones — sealed-off spaces inside hotels, clubs and restaurants operating under a designated foreign liquor licence.While there is no official limit on consumption volume, everything is billed and recorded.Even with a valid permit, the glass must stay within these designated zones. Every guest’s name is registered before service, every bill traceable, and yes, even Ahmedabad residents can be invited, provided the meeting is deemed business-related. The guardrails extend beyond the bar counter. Those who drink cannot drive; they must leave with a designated driver. In case of an inquiry, a wine-and-dine bill serves as proof of authorised consumption — every toast documented in detail within Gujarat’s carefully calibrated social experiment.GIFT City’s social scene operates within tight boundaries. Currently, two wine-and-dine facilities serve the zone, with more planned as new commercial towers and hotels open.Taral Shah, a developer working on projects in GIFT City, said: “GIFT City is India’s only operational International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) and smart city, and we have seen interest growing among foreign companies year by year. With liquor norms relaxed, companies from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru are also setting up base in GIFT City. We expect more facilities as additional buildings become operational. We also hope that taxes will come down because wine-anddine facilities here primarily serve the salaried class. When the govt announced the relaxation two years ago, real estate enquiries in GIFT City saw a sudden jump of 25-30%.”The impact extends beyond realty metrics. An official at one of the licensed wine-and-dine facilities said the relaxation has transformed the sentiment within GIFT City: more employees now stay back in the evenings to catch up over drinks.“On weekdays, we see an average of about 15 people coming in to wine and dine. The number doubles to around 30 on weekends. The VAT is higher than other states, but we expect it to be rationalised soon and brought on a par with other states, which should further drive consumption,” the official said.The shift is reshaping the everyday rhythm at GIFT City as professionals embrace post-work socialisation. “The relaxation of liquor laws is a welcome move. The process of obtaining access is also convenient and easy. GIFT City is successfully creating a lifestyle and culture that matches international standards,” said Dhruv Singh (name changed), a professional working at GIFT City. Small changes signal larger shifts. Earlier, photography was banned at these facilities, but that restriction has been lifted — suggesting that GIFT City is easing into its new culture of controlled comfort.The demographics tell their own story: 15% of visitors at GIFT City’s wine-and-dine facilities are foreigners, while 85% are Indian, primarily employees and their occasional guests. The typical patron is between 26 and 45 years old. Beer dominates, with most patrons preferring to unwind over a pint or light drink after work. Spirits see lower uptake, likely due to both preferences and higher taxation.The licensed facilities operate from 11am and attract some daytime visitors, too, though crowds peak in the evenings. “We’re also seeing small groups using the space for formal and informal business discussions,” said a hotelier.Not every company, however, is ready to raise a toast just yet. Some firms deliberately avoid issuing permission letters for employees to access these facilities.“Our organisation has made a conscious decision to not issue letters to employees for drinking at the wine-and-dine facilities at GIFT City. Since alcohol prohibition continues beyond GIFT City limits, companies are worried about any incident that could tarnish their reputation,” explains Tanya Sharma (name changed), who works with an MNC at GIFT-IFSC.Industry leaders see broader potential. Narendra Somani, president of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat, argues that two years of regulated liquor access at GIFT City shows how controlled liberalisation can help build a wineand-dine culture while also generating revenue for the state.“Govt should consider extending such relaxations in a regulated manner across Gujarat, especially with increasing foreign investments in Ahmedabad, a growing expat community, and Gujarat’s bids for the Commonwealth Games 2030 [which it won on Wednesday] and the 2036 Olympics. Gujarat’s hospitality sector loses social and corporate event business to other states. With thoughtful liberalisation, Gujarat’s tourism industry could take a significant leap forward,” Somani said.Sanjay Kaul, IAS, MD and group CEO, GIFT City, said: “The streamlining of prohibition norms specific to GIFT City has been widely welcomed by companies and professionals, who see it as a reflection of the city’s global readiness.”The numbers may appear modest, but they represent Gujarat’s incremental approach to social liberalisation within an economic enclave, carefully avoiding any challenge to the broader prohibition framework across the state.A senior official emphasises that the relaxation aligns with GIFT City’s ambition to position itself as a global financial hub.“Several companies in GIFT City had identified prohibition as a challenge in attracting young talent. Since the relaxation, we have growing traction from global firms and multinational corporations. Previously, semiconductor design companies favoured Bengaluru or Hyderabad. But now, with a semiconductor manufacturing cluster coming up in Gujarat, GIFT City has become a viable alternative,” a GIFT City official said.Recent developments support this claim. Sources confirmed that a European semiconductor design firm recently established an office in GIFT City. “Global corporations require wine-and-dine facilities not just for employees but also for hosting international clients. With world-class infrastructure, airport connectivity, and the recent easing of liquor norms, GIFT City now stands on a par with other global financial hubs,” the official added.GIFT City’s liquor model remains unique: a closed-loop ecosystem where access, sale, and consumption are all verified and logged — an administrative “wet bubble” in an otherwise dry state.As GIFT City expands with new corporate tenants and residential projects, the central question persists: will Gujarat replicate this model elsewhere, or will it remain a singular concession at India’s global financial hub?For now, Gujarat’s controlled experiment continues — each glass raised within GIFT City represents not just a drink, but a data point in one of India’s most closely-watched policy experiments.","Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within GIFT City on New Year’s Eve 2023.

You cook, clean, manage bills, raise your kid and fight the silence that hits you every single winter,"" Ankur said.He said friends are polite but distant and community is rare, unlike India where there is chaos but also constant human contact.He says, ""Community is rare. Back home, you fight corruption and chaos but at least you have people around you. In West problems are different and they cut deeper in ways you can’t explain unless you’ve lived it.""Ankur said he is returning to Delhi on 5 December despite the city’s pollution levels. “Every place has a cost. Most of us are just learning which costs we can survive.

NEW DELHI: To make civil services future ready and to achieve the goal of a developed India, the principal secretary to PM, P K Mishra , Thursday suggested three guiding principles — “reorienting the purpose of civil services to developmental state, re-imagining selection to identify deeply capable individuals and building a lifelong learning state”.Addressing the centenary conference of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the country’s top bureaucrat also spoke about a shift from process compliance to outcome delivery; from incremental improvement to accelerated transformation; from siloed govt departments to interoperable digital infrastructure; and from a state that delivers to citizens to a state that partners with citizens.In a statement, the PMO said Mishra underlined how emergence of technology, urbanisation, climate challenges and frequent disasters have reshaped the responsibilities of civil servants, and today’s governance demands collaboration more than hierarchy.Highlighting the world is becoming more interconnected and volatile, with strategic competition spanning technology, supply chains, data, cybersecurity, AI, space and critical minerals, he said civil servants are managers of uncertainty, interpreters of complexity and guardians of India’s strategic interests, and their readiness must begin with how they are selected.","Principal secretary to PM, P K Mishra, suggests three guiding principles.

Superbugs now resistant to key everyday antibiotics: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/superbugs-now-resistant-to-key-everyday-antibiotics-icmr/articleshow/125626275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Some of the most common infections - urinary tract, pneumonia, sepsis and diarrhoeal illnesses - are becoming increasingly harder to treat in India as widely used antibiotics continue to fail at alarming rates.ICMR's annual report 2024 'Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN)', showed that routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently seen in hospitals.Based on nearly one lakh lab-confirmed infection samples from leading hospitals, the report showed drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to dominate. E coli, the most common cause of UTIs and abdominal and bloodstream infections, showed declining susceptibility to strong antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a major cause of pneumonia and sepsis, is resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam in nearly three-fourths of the cases and to carbapenems in most samples, limiting treatment options.In ICUs, the situation is even more alarming. Acinetobacter baumannii shows 91% resistance to meropenem, forcing doctors to use more toxic or complicated drug combinations.Pseudomonas aeruginosa continues to show rising resistance. Overall, 72% of bloodstream infections were caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, while ventilator-associated pneumonia was driven largely by acinetobacter, klebsiella and pseudomonas - organisms against which many commonly prescribed high-end antibiotics are ineffective.Though some isolated improvements were seen - including better sensitivity of E coli to amikacin and select cephalosporins - the broader resistance landscape continues to worsen. Diarrhoeal pathogens showed high resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and more than 95% of salmonella yyphi samples were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Among fungi, candida auris showed resistance in nearly 10% of isolates, while one-third of aspergillus samples were resistant to amphotericin B.ICMR said the data reflects hospital infections, not community patterns. But experts warn the message is unmistakable: India's most widely used antibiotics are losing power, and critically ill patients are already facing the consequences. Without aggressive stewardship and rational prescribing, they caution, even common infections may soon become untreatable.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said the findings mark a dangerous shift. ""Strong antibiotics are failing against infections once treated easily. This signals an urgent public-health challenge that demands tighter control on antibiotic use and stronger infection-prevention measures.""Data shows how quickly options are shrinking. ""Everyday bacteria are resisting medicines we once relied on. In ICUs, choices are narrowing even further. Rational antibiotic use is no longer optional - it's essential to preserve what still works,"" Dr Rakesh Gupta, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said.","Routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently seen in hospitals.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and RJD MP Manoj Jha on Thursday told Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter, yet through an ""unconstitutional"" pan-India Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of state electoral rolls is seeking proof of Indian citizenship from voters.Jha's counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the kind of documents that are being sought from voters through enumeration forms under SIR will disfranchise lakhs and lakhs of voters who would not have documents to show their date of birth, landholding ownership or parents birth certificates. ""That is why we are insisting that Aadhaar must be the basis for enrolment in voter list,"" Sibal said.For Venugopal, senior advocate A M Singhvi said the basis and ground for SIR are both wrong. EC is conducting a pan-India SIR when Representation of the People Act empowers it to conduct it for a constituency. The SC asked if the reason for SIR is to eliminate the dead from the voter list, would such a reason confine the exercise to one constituency or all constituencies?Singhvi, also appearing for TMC MP Mahua Moitra and NGO People's Union for Civil Liberties, agreed with Sibal and said the entire exercise is exclusionary.""EC is conducting this exercise with a figment of imagination that masses of illegal migrants are marauding across India. And, the procedure adopted for conducting this exclusionary exercise is neither prescribed by the Constitution nor the RP Act,"" he said.Venugopal's counsel said, ""There had been several revisions of electoral rolls since 2003. On one hand, EC is not asking those whose names figure in the 2003 voters' list for any document. On the other hand, a voter enrolled after 2003 is being discriminatorily asked to prove everything, including citizenship.""""Through this exercise to illegally seek proof of citizenship, EC is converting itself into a citizenship tribunal, which is beyond its constitutional mandate. EC can supplement the process prescribed in the RP Act, but not supplant it,"" Singhvi said.Sibal said teachers and other govt employees are engaged as booth level officers (BLOs) who have neither the knowledge nor expertise in scrutinising documentary proofs of citizenship nor are they legally empowered to do so as determination of citizenship is entrusted to the ministry of home affairs.Countering Sibal's assertion, EC counsel Eklavya Dwivedi said BLOs do not scrutinise documents. This is being done by electoral registration officers, who are SDM-level bureaucrats. Sibal said it is the BLO who scrutinises documents and sends doubtful cases to ERO. The arguments would continue Tuesday.",Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and RJD MP Manoj Jha told Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter. Jha's counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the kind of documents that are being sought from voters will disfranchise lakhs of voters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125626231,imgsize-861481,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Explosive incidents deepen concerns across Pakistan



Security forces in Pakistan have killed at least 22 militants linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) during a major intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military said on Thursday.The raid was launched in Dera Ismail Khan after reports emerged about the presence of members of the group referred to by authorities as “Fitna Al-Khawarij”. According to the military, troops “effectively engaged at the hideout of the terrorists, and after an intense exchange of fire, 22 were eliminated”.Officials said a combing operation was continuing to ensure no other militants remained in the area.The operation came as the province witnessed another series of violent incidents targeting law enforcement. Overnight, militants armed with assault rifles opened fire on a police checkpoint in Hangu district, killing three officers before escaping. Officers returned fire, but it remained unclear whether the attackers suffered casualties, District Police Chief Khan Zeb said.A search effort to track down the assailants is ongoing, with investigators suspecting the Pakistani Taliban, who have been linked to similar assaults in recent years.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the officers killed in Hangu, praising their “bravery and sacrifice” and noting that police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were playing a crucial role in countering militancy.The attack followed a deadly assault days earlier in Peshawar, where two suicide bombers and a gunman stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three officers and injuring 11.In addition to targeted attacks on security forces, civilians have also suffered from a rise in explosions across the country. In Balochistan’s Bolan district, three children were killed when an explosive device detonated outside their home on Wednesday. Police official Jan Mohammad Khosa said investigations were ongoing.Separately, two young men died in Bajaur district after an abandoned landmine exploded in the Jannat Shah area. The victims, identified as Shamshad, 18, and Usman, 22, were passing through when the device went off. Security teams cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those responsible.Pakistan has experienced a marked surge in militant violence in recent years, with officials frequently blaming the TTP. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghanistan of allowing the group to operate from its territory, a claim Kabul denies, though tensions have remained high since 2021.",At least 22 militants linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) killed in operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Govt moving towards opening up nuclear sector to private players: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-moving-towards-opening-up-nuclear-sector-to-private-players-pm-modi/articleshow/125623839.cms,"Photo credit: PTI

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments on the lines of the space sector.“The scope of reforms is continuously expanding. Just as space innovation was opened to the private sector, India is now moving towards opening the nuclear sector as well,” Modi said while inaugurating Skyroot’s Infinity Campus in Hyderabad via video conferencing. “A strong role for the private sector is being laid in this field, which will create opportunities in small modular reactors, advanced reactors and nuclear innovation. This reform will give new strength to India’s energy security and technological leadership,” he said.The PM’s remarks came ahead of Parliament’s winter session in which a key nuclear energy bill proposing to open up the civil nuclear sector to private players is listed. The Atomic Energy Bill, 2025, is listed in the Lok Sabha bulletin for the session, which will start from Dec 1. Amendments to another key nuclear law, Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010, are also on the cards.These amendments, if successfully passed, will usher in big reforms in the nuclear sector at a time when India has set a target of generating at least 100 GW nuclear energy by 2047.At present, the Atomic Energy Act prohibits the participation of the private sector or even state govts. Under this law, the power to operate nuclear power plants is vested in the central govt and companies or corporations established by it. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a PSU under the Department of Atomic Energy, is the only entity operating nuclear power plants, and currently operates all 24 commercial nuclear reactors in the country.Modi also said the future will depend greatly on the research being carried out today, and underscored that the govt is focused on providing maximum opportunities for youth in research. He underlined that the Rs 1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation Fund will provide significant support to the youth. Modi said more than 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs have already been set up to instil a spirit of research and innovation among students, and added that work is under way to establish 50,000 new labs in the coming days, he said.","PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments. “A strong role for the private sector is being laid in this field, which will create opportunities in small modular reactors, advanced reactors and nuclear innovation,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125623836,imgsize-906329,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-pti.jpg"

SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused Thursday his own party’s govt in J&K of “failing to fulfil electoral promises and following BJP’s approach of mere political slogans”.Mehdi, critical of the leadership for nearly a year, launched the latest attack from chief minister Omar Abdullah’s assembly constituency Ganderbal as the NC began a two-day working committee meeting under president Farooq Abdullah and the CM, who is also party vice-president.“We sought votes for restoration of constitutional guarantees under Article 370, and it was one of the main reasons we received a huge mandate in the (Oct 2024 assembly) polls. We promised to strive for the release of political prisoners. We must fulfil all commitments. We can’t adopt BJP’s language after coming to office,” the Srinagar MP told supporters in Ganderbal.According to Mehdi, NC’s election campaign last year was centered on Article 370 but it has focused on seeking statehood (restoration) since taking office. “If we shift from Article 370 to statehood, we are aligning with BJP’s line,” the MP argued.Mehdi claimed ignorance about NC’s meeting. “I am a permanent member of the working committee. This is the first time since 2002 that I have not been invited,” the MP said.Mehdi suggested that his disagreements with the party stemmed from his insistence that it must work on the issues over which votes were sought. “A year has passed. We have not worked on our political and governance agenda. We have not rationalised reservations in J&K. We cannot tell open-merit candidates who are crossing the age bar that we still have five years to act,” Mehdi said, adding the govt had not also kept its promise of 200 units of free electricity.Insisting that he was not protesting against his party but reminding it of its promises and manifesto, Mehdi pointed out that J&K’s people had reposed trust in mainstream political parties after a long time last year, handing NC a big mandate that must be honoured.Mehdi brushed away at statements by deputy CM Surinder Choudhary asking the MP to raise issues in Parliament instead of trying to stay in the limelight. “He (Choudhary) was earlier with BJP, then he joined PDP, and now he is in NC. In his politics there is no principle, no direction, no value,” Mehdi said.The MP also criticised the Omar-led govt over a demolition drive in the Valley against settlers, saying people had voted for NC so that “what is happening in Uttar Pradesh does not happen in Kashmir”.","National Conference (NC) MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused his own party’s govt in J&K of “failing to fulfil electoral promises” Mehdi, critical of the leadership for nearly a year, launched the latest attack from chief minister Omar Abdullah's constituency Ganderbal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125622520,imgsize-23028,width-400,resizemode-4/mp-aga-ruhullah-mehdi.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Highway contractors and concessionaires not meeting project quality standards will get up to 30 negative marks — a penalty that will lower their ratings and make it more difficult for them to secure new contracts in the future. Conversely, contractors who complete projects on time and maintain high quality will receive 30 and 40 marks, respectively.Under the framework for ‘Contractor/Concessionaire Rating System for NH Projects”, unveiled by the road transport ministry on Thursday, the maximum score will be 100 and the rating exercise will be held annually. Highway builders will be rated on seven parameters — timely completion, quality, maintenance, safety, disputes, subcontracting, overall performance and user rating, and negative marks for poor quality.This rating system is being introduced amid rising complaints about substandard construction, poor quality and inadequate maintenance of highway stretches. These issues have been flagged by PM Narendra Modi during highway sector review meetings and also by parliamentary panels. Highway minister Nitin Gadkari has repeatedly sought action against contractors for poor-quality work.According to the framework, failures, major defects, or stretches getting damaged before completion or during the defect-liability period will attract up to five negative points, while failures or defects in retaining (RE) walls will draw up to 10 negative points.Contractors will also be penalised for failing to deploy qualified professionals. Recent incidents such as damage on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway and the collapse of an RE wall on NH-66 in Kerala have been glaring examples of poor-quality construction.Officials said the rating system assigns 70 marks for timely completion and quality, aiming to clearly identify high-performing contractors. “While poor performers will face penalties, good performers will be rewarded,” an official said. The rating will primarily be done during the construction period to ensure objective assessment and identification of performers and non-performers.All national highway projects completed or provisionally completed in the last three years will be eligible for ratings. Projects that have been underway for at least 180 days since the last appointed date will also be rated.Contracts will be grouped into three categories: Rs 100 crore–300 crore; Rs 300 crore–1,000 crore; and above Rs 1,000 crore.",Road transport ministry unveils framework for ‘Contractor/Concessionaire Rating System for NH Projects’ Maximum score will be 100 and the rating exercise will be held annually.

Whatever you also tell in your media also tell. Your anchor also speak. Whether your reporter speak, that is important. That is the power.""The clarification came amid intensifying discussions over leadership transition in Karnataka after the Congress government completed two and a half years in office, a point at which Shivakumar’s supporters believe a rotational understanding from 2023 should take effect. While Siddaramaiah has consistently maintained his intent to serve a full five-year term, Shivakumar's recent remarks and online posts have been interpreted as renewed signalling of his claim to the post.The exchange marked a departure from previous months, where comments had largely come from supporters of both leaders rather than from the two principals themselves. The matter now rests with the Congress high command, as both sides await direction on whether the leadership question will be settled or deferred.","Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday clarified that his recent social media post on ""word power"" was meant to mark Constitution Day. His clarification followed a sharp exchange between the two senior leaders that played out publicly. Siddaramaiah responded later using similar phrasing to assert that the mandate belongs to the government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125621312,imgsize-1130933,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Friday said that Pakistan’s armed forces launched multiple attacks using drones and other munitions along the entire western border on the intervening night of May 8-9.These attacks were ""effectively repulsed,"" the Army said.Pakistani troops also engaged in “numerous ceasefire violations” along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, the Army said in an early morning post on X.The post included a short video clip and reaffirming India's intent to respond firmly to any hostile actions.""OPERATION SINDOOR - Pakistan Armed Forces launched multiple attacks using drones and other munitions along entire Western Border on the intervening night of 08 and 09 May 2025. Pak troops also resorted to numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir,"" the post said.The Indian Army stated that the drone attacks were ""effectively repulsed"" and that a ""befitting reply"" was given in response to the ceasefire violations.""#IndianArmy remains committed to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Nation. All nefarious designs will be responded with force,"" it added.In a large-scale counter-drone operation, Army's Air Defence units deployed a range of advanced weaponry including L-70 guns, Zu-23mm systems, Schilka systems, and specialised counter-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipment and S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" .India’s counter-drone and air defence capabilities are supported by a combination of legacy and modern weapon systems designed to neutralise aerial threats, including drones, missiles, and low-flying aircraft. Among these, the L-70 guns are 40mm anti-aircraft artillery pieces originally developed by Bofors. They are known for their high rate of fire and are capable of engaging fast-moving aerial targets at low altitudes. India has upgraded these guns with modern electro-optical fire control systems to enhance accuracy and automation.The Zu-23mm systems are twin-barrel, Soviet-era anti-aircraft guns that remain in service due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Mounted on a towed platform, the Zu-23 is capable of delivering a high volume of fire and is often used to defend static installations against low-flying threats. These guns can also be paired with radar and optical targeting systems for improved response.The Schilka system, officially known as ZSU-23-4, is a self-propelled, radar-guided anti-aircraft weapon system mounted on a tracked chassis. It is equipped with four 23mm autocannons and an integrated radar system, giving it the capability to track and destroy multiple aerial targets in real-time. Despite its age, the Indian Army has modernised the Schilka with advanced fire control systems and thermal imaging sights.To address the evolving threat from drones and unmanned systems, India also deployed specialised counter-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipment. These systems include radar and electro-optical sensors for drone detection, as well as jammers and directed-energy weapons for neutralisation. The integration of kinetic systems like guns and non-kinetic tools such as jammers provides a layered defence mechanism, essential for protecting sensitive military and civilian infrastructure from modern aerial threats.On the intervening night of May 7 and 8, India used the S-400 Sudarshan Chakra defence missile systems to take down Pakistani drones and missiles fired towards 15 Indian cities, thwarting Islamabad's attempt to damage military installations. Indian Air Force S-400 Sudarshan Chakra air defence missile systems were fired last night against targets moving towards India.The targets were successfully neutralised in the operation.The S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" is an Indian name given to the S-400 Triumf air defence missile system acquired from Russia. The term ""Sudarshan Chakra"" draws from the Epic Mahabharata, symbolising precision, speed, and lethal capability, qualities that closely reflect the S-400's operational strengths.Developed by Russia's Almaz-Antey, the S-400 is among the most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile systems in the world. India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 to procure five S-400 units, with the first system deployed in Punjab in 2021 to bolster defences against threats from Pakistan and China.The S-400 can engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 400 km and detect threats as far as 600 km away. It supports four different types of missiles, enabling it to target everything from aircraft and drones to cruise and ballistic missiles.","Pakistani troops also engaged in “numerous ceasefire violations” along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir. Indian Army stated that the drone attacks were ""effectively repulsed"" and that a ""befitting reply"" was given in response to the ceasefire violations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121016691,imgsize-88286,width-400,resizemode-4/Stories-31.jpg"

The video comes after overnight attacks launched by the Pakistani Armed Forces involving drones, and other munitions across the western border and along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir In a post on X, the Army said: “OPERATION SINDOOR: Pakistan Armed Forces launched multiple attacks using drones and other munitions along entire Western Border on the intervening night of 08 and 09 May 2025.Pak troops also resorted to numerous cease fire violations (CFVs) along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. The drone attacks were effectively repulsed and befitting reply was given to the CFVs. Indian Army remains committed to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Nation. All nefarious designs will be responded with force.”Last night, over 50 drones were neutralised by the Army's Air Defence units in J&K, ANI reported quoting sources. The engagement saw extensive deployment of L-70 guns, Zu-23mm cannons, Schilka systems, and other advanced counter-UAS technologies.The Army's response came two days after it had launched Operation Sindoor , which saw missile strikes on nine terror camps inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The strikes targeted infrastructure associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in retaliation for the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.Defence sources told news agency ANI that at least two drones were shot down in the Naushera sector during a heavy exchange of artillery fire. Explosions were also heard in the Poonch and Rajouri districts on Friday morning, with a complete blackout was enforced in some areas.'Videos showed houses in border towns of J&K being damaged in the shelling.""When blackout happened at 9 in the night, we heard the explosions. Earlier, we thought it was firecrackers, but later we realised it was a real bomb, targeted at us. We never thought of experiencing this,"" a local from Rajasthan's Jaislmer told ANI.Meanwhile, the Border Security Force (BSF) thwarted an infiltration bid along the International Boundary in Samba district late on Thursday night. “At around 2300 hours on 8 May 2025, BSF foiled a major infiltration bid at the International Boundary in Samba district, J&K,” BSF Jammu said in a post.",Pak troops also resorted to numerous cease fire violations (CFVs) along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.

"India logged 19.7L excess deaths in 2021, 6x official Covid toll: Government data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-logged-19-7l-excess-deaths-in-2021-6x-official-covid-toll-government-data/articleshow/121013243.cms,"India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in Covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year, as per official data based on the civil registration system (CRS) that was released on Wednesday. After accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike in deaths in 2021 is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.The highest undercounting of deaths was in Gujarat, which saw nearly 2 lakh excess fatalities, more than 33 times the state's official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021, the data revealed.Excess deaths were 18 times higher than the official Covid toll in Madhya Pradesh and 15 times higher in West Bengal. In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, excess deaths were more than 10 times higher than the official Covid toll.The lowest discrepancy between official Covid tolls and the calculated excess deaths for that year were in Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi, the data reveals. The report on vital statistics of India based on the civil registration system (CRS) released on Wednesday shows that India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in the Covid year of 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year. Not all of the excess deaths are attributable to Covid, but even accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.Gujarat saw the highest undercounting of deaths with nearly 2 lakh excess deaths, more than 33 times the official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021. Other states where the excess deaths were several times the official Covid toll were Madhya Pradesh (18x) and West Bengal (15x). In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, the excess deaths were over ten times the official Covid toll.How do we get to these numbers? Even with the death rate remaining unchanged, the number of deaths would increase as the population does. Hence, we applied the 2019 death rates, as revealed in the sample registration system (SRS), to the 2021 population projected by the Census office to arrive at what the number of deaths should have been in 2021 in the normal course. In fact, death rates had been falling steadily till 2019, so these estimates actually somewhat overestimate what the numbers would have been. We then compared this estimate to the actual number for 2021 reported by the CRS. The difference is 'excess deaths'.In Madya Pradesh, the government's Covid death tally for 2021 was about 6,900 deaths. However, total deaths registered in 2021 exceeded the number projected using 2019 death rates by about 1.3 lakh. West Bengal reported a little over 10,000 Covid deaths in 2021, while excess deaths were over 1.5 lakh.Among larger states, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi showed the least discrepancy between the Covid death tally given by the respective governments for 2021 and the calculated excess deaths for that year. In these, excess deaths varied from 1.5 to 3.1 times the official Covid toll.Another report, on medical certification of cause of deaths in 2021, also released on Wednesday, shows that Covid was the second leading cause of death that year accounting for 17.3% of deaths, behind diseases of the circulatory system, which accounted for 29.8% of total medically certified deaths. This meant that despite medically certified deaths accounting for less than a quarter (23.4%) of total registered deaths, the number of certified Covid deaths in the report was 4.1 lakh, higher than India's official tally of 3.3 lakh Covid deaths.","India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in Covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year.

NEW DELHI: In fast widening hostilities, India hit several air defence systems and other targets in Pakistan after thwarting missiles and drones launched from across the border against Indian military bases and civilian areas in the early hours of Thursday as well as later at night. Operation Sindoor is fully underway. Pakistan army chief Asim Munir will not be given a face-saving exit,"" a senior officer told TOI, as India's counter-strikes were still unfolding at night, including forward deployment of warships in northern Arabian Sea and total breakdown of the LoC ceasefire.Amid the 'fog of war', there were unconfirmed reports of two Pakistani JF-17 jets and an F-16 fighter being shot down and India targeting Pak capital Islamabad.The IAF deployed Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones, which act as cruise missiles by exploding into enemy targets and radars, soon after Pakistan launched a salvo of missiles and suicide drones at 15 Indian military targets in northern and western India around 1am.The drone and missile attacks by Pakistan resumed as it got dark, with multiple locations being targeted, including Jaisalmer air base, Amritsar and military stations of Jammu, Pathankot and Udhampur as well as other places like Samba and Arnia. Explosions caused panic in Jammu city as the heavily-guarded airport was one of the targets. ""The threats were neutralised by our armed forces through kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) actions. There were no losses,"" an officer said.India launched a massive retaliatory attack on Thursday as IAF drone strikes destroyed a Chinese-origin HQ-9 surface-to-air missile and radar system in Lahore. Other sites targeted in Pakistan included Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Khenju (Sind), Attock, Miano, Bahawalpur and an area near Karachi.Earlier in the day, Pakistan launched an attack on Indian military assets, including IAF bases in Awantipura, Srinagar and Uttarlai as well as Army formations in Jammu, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Bathinda and Chandigarh, which was foiled by the multi-layered air defence network led by the formidable Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile system.Also read: Army foils Pakistan's attempts to send swarm drones across LoC Following India's retaliation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India has always played the role of a responsible nation by exercising great restraint and trying to resolve issues through dialogue. ""But if anyone tries to take advantage of our restraint, they will face the same kind of quality action as yesterday,"" he said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the Pahalgam terror massacre was the ""original escalation"" and the Indian armed forces were only responding to it. ""India's response is non-escalatory, precise and measured. Our intention is not to escalate matters, and we are only responding to the escalation,"" he said. ""Any further action by Pakistan, some of which we are seeing today, is nothing but escalation by Pakistan once again, and will be responded to and is being responded to appropriately,"" he added.The outrage at Pakistan's attempt to hit Indian military bases at 15 locations in the morning was quite evident. Colonel Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, at a briefing, said it had been made amply clear that Operation Sindoor on Wednesday had specifically hit nine terror hubs across the border, without any Pakistani military establishments being targeted.""It was also reiterated that any attack on military targets in India will invite a suitable response. On Thursday, the Indian response has been in the same domain with the same intensity as Pakistan,"" Wing Commander Singh said.Pakistan has increased the intensity of its unprovoked firing across the 778-km Line of Control, using mortars and heavy-calibre artillery guns in Kupwara, Baramulla, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar and Rajouri in J&K, in which 16 civilians, including three women and five children, were killed.

NEW DELHI: As Pakistan launched airstrikes in several Jammu regions on Thursday, its army used ""cheap rockets"" and was ""behaving like Hamas terror group"", PTI reported citing defence sources.Indian Armed Forces intercepted eight missiles from Pakistan directed at Satwari (Jammu Airport), Samba, RS Pura and Arnia.Incidentally, there were reports of a meeting between ISI and Hamas operatives in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Visuals and footage from Jammu strongly resemble a Hamas-style attack on Israel that took place on October 8, using multiple cheap rockets.Additionally, Pakistani forces initiated unprovoked shelling along the Line of Control in Kupwara and Baramulla districts late Thursday evening, prompting a strong response from the Indian military, officials reported.The shelling targeted the Boniyar sector in Baramulla and the Tangdhar sector in Kupwara, though no casualties have been reported so far.A complete blackout has been enforced in Akhnoor, Kishtwar, Samba and other Jammu regions. Blackout has also been imposed in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Jaisalmer, Gurdaspur in Punjab along with Bikaner, Rajasthan.This came after India launched Operation Sindoor targeting nine terrorist sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

It also has the French-origin Spada anti-aircraft system with a 20-25km range for defence of airbases and other important facilities, among other systems.""The S-400, which has four kinds of missiles to intercept targets at ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380km, by far outclasses the HQ-9. It is crucial to our air defence coverage and is fully plugged into IAF's integrated air command and control system (IACCS),"" an officer said.Under the $5.4 billion(Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons in north-west and east India to cater to both China and Pakistan.The S-400 radars - the primary acquisition one has a 600km range - can track hundreds of targets simultaneously. Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, however, has been hugely delayed to 2026-27 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.The fully-automated IACCS network , which combines a wide array of sensors and weapons, is now progressively also integrating military radars with civilian ones. ""With the new Akashteer system, data from IAF and Army radars are fused to provide a unified, real-time air picture, which is available to all IAF and Army air defence centres,"" another officer said.India is also developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha . With an interception range of around 350km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29,as reported by TOI earlier.Army, Navy and Air Force have all inducted the potent Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70km range, jointly developed with Israel. Army and IAF have also inducted in large numbers the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, which is now also being exported to other countries.Armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. They include the older Russian Igla-1M (5km), OSA-AK-M (10km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5km). The newer ones are Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6km) systems.

Justice Varma has been without judicial work since March 2

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna is understood to have recommended to the Centre to initiate a motion in Parliament for removal of Allahabad high court 's Justice Yashwant Varma , who refused to resign despite a judicial inquiry corroborating discovery of huge amount of cash at his official residence in Delhi on March 14.The SC officially said on Thursday that the CJI, in line with the in-house procedure, has written to President Droupadi Murmu and PM Modi ""enclosing therewith copy of the three-member committee report dated May 3 along with the letter/response dated May 6 received from Justice Varma"".Under the in-house procedure, if an inquiry report indicts the judge for corruption or misdemeanour, the CJI would ask the judge concerned to either resign or seek voluntary retirement. If the judge refuses, the CJI is to write to the President and the PM to initiate removal proceedings under the Judges Inquiry Act .On the recommendation of the CJI, the govt will have to initiate a motion for removal of Justice Varma in either Lok Sabha (minimum 150 MPs to sign) or Rajya Sabha (50 MPs to sign). It would then be open for the LS speaker or the RS chairman to decide whether the motion is to be admitted.Once the motion is admitted, the speaker or chairman would constitute a three-member committee comprising an SC judge and an HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist. The committee will frame charges against the judge for investigation and the judge concerned will have an opportunity to refute the evidence.After a formal trial, the committee will give a report to the House concerned, which, if it finds the judge guilty, will debate the matter in the two Houses. The judge can be removed only after each House with two-thirds of members present and voting support the motion. Earlier, Parliament had debated removal motions against SC judge V Ramaswami, which fell through in Lok Sabha in 1991, and Calcutta HC's Justice Soumitra Sen, who resigned midway through the debate in Parliament.In its May 3 report, the inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana HC Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman corroborated the finding that a huge amount of cash was found at Justice Varma's residence by first responders to a fire incident at his official Tughlaq Crescent bungalow in Delhi.The inquiry panel had also detailed the mysterious disappearance of bundles of cash that had not caught fire on the night of March 14-15 after the first responders and police left the scene. The CJI had sent the adverse report to Justice Varma seeking his response.The CJI had also suggested to Justice Varma to tender his resignation given the virtual indictment by the informal inquiry panel constituted by the CJI on March 22. His refusal to do so and readiness to prove his innocence before a formal inquiry committee, which will be set up following admission of a motion in either House of Parliament, forced the CJI's hand to write to the President and the PM.Justice Varma has been without judicial work since March 20. He was repatriated to Allahabad HC later in the month and the CJ concerned was advised not to assign him any judicial work. He will continue to be without judicial work till the formal inquiry, set up after admission of the motion for his removal in one of the Houses in Parliament, is completed and Parliament debates it.",Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna is understood to have recommended to the Centre to initiate a motion in Parliament for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma.

NEW DELHI: The presence of senior Pakistan army officers at the funeral of one of those killed in India's surgical strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed's terror camp at Bahawalpur sparked speculation about Abdul Rauf Asghar - the younger brother of Jaish chief Masood Azhar and mastermind of the IC814 hijack , Pathankot fidayeen strike and the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel - being among those killed.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, at the official govt briefing on Thursday, refused to comment on the speculation about Rauf's death, but sources in security agencies said the funeral attendance was seen as a possible giveaway.Rauf, around 48 years old, was the most senior Jaish figure residing in the Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur. Rauf is believed to be the de facto head of Jaish, managing all its operations, overseeing training of its top fidayeen and plotting terror attacks against India.On X, BJP said Rauf had been ""eliminated"" while recalling his role as the prime conspirator and mastermind behind the Kandahar hijack, executed by him to secure the release of his brother Masood, the Pathankot attack and the 2001 Parliament terror strike.Masood chose the targets but stayed away from the finer planning, leaving such details to his younger brother. Masood himself is believed to be in the protective custody of Pakistan authorities at an undisclosed location in either Islamabad or Rawalpindi.Also read: PIB counters fake social media claims amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan Sources indicated that Masood was never an 'operations' man but the prime motivator for Jaish, who could turn 'jihadi' recruits into committed fidayeen with his fiery sermons. His recorded sermons still do the job, even as planning and execution of operations was left to Rauf.Rauf arranged consignments of weapons, including M4 rifles left behind by Nato forces in Afghanistan, through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-based smugglers for Markaz Subhan Allah.Rauf was designated by the home ministry as an ""individual terrorist"" in Oct 2020 under UAPA.

""Whenever Pakistan escalates the conflict, aircraft will get little farther away routes (from Pakistan airspace) in the Indian airspace. This will lead to slightly longer routes. But the big difference will be when an en route flight diverts to now further away airports in India,"" said a pilot.Meanwhile, Indian carriers have pulled out their aircraft from the 27 closed airports. ""The aircraft were flown out as ferry flights (without passengers). Crew stationed there has also been brought to Delhi or other places by trains. As of now, given the way Pakistan is brazenly acting, we don't know when normalcy will return and these airports will open. So, we couldn't have had our crew stuck there,"" said a senior official of an airline.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban.

NEW DELHI: The initial civilian casualties in Poonch due to the relentless mortar fire and shelling by Pakistani forces occurred while the evacuation of residents from border villages was still underway, a government source said. Evacuations, officials told TOI, have since been stepped up not only in Poonch but also other border villages spread across Uri, Baramulla, Karnah, Tangdhar, Mendhar and Rajouri in J&K, all of which came under shelling on Tuesday and Wednesday night.Pakistan army had resorted to heavy mortar fire and shelling at several points in J&K close to LoC/international border soon after Indian armed forces struck terror facilities across PoK and Pakistan during the intervening night of May 6 and 7.Though Poonch town - which is just 2-3 km from the LoC, as is Rawalakot in PoK - has traditionally never been targeted with shelling, this time was an exception.The Pakistani forces opened heavy mortar fire, hitting civilian targets in the main Poonch town. This caused more than a dozen casualties, essentially border residents that were yet to be moved to bunkers of safer places inside. Local hospitals reported many more as injured.At its briefing here on Thursday, the ministry of external affairs put the overall toll of civilians killed in shelling from Pakistan, at 16, and the injured at 59.TOI has learnt that though the evacuation plans were drawn up in advance, with community bunkers readied across several border villages and schools and other buildings in areas further from the border earmarked to accommodate displaced border residents, the deployment of additional troops and equipment at LoC in anticipation of an escalation by Pakistan had been going on for the last few days.Civilian population was yet to be fully evacuated when Pakistani forces struck with mortar fire and shelling at several points along the LoC/IB. The Indian forces - Army and BSF - responded to the provocation with heavy retaliatory fire.Over the past couple of days, the J&K administration has ensured the evacuation of a large number of border residents, relocating them in community bunkers or government buildings like schools and halls, till the border is safer.""The local authorities in the border districts are connected 24x7 to the integrated control room to coordinate evacuation, emergency response, blackouts, medical assistance and maintenance of essential supplies and services,"" a senior J&K government official told TOI.","Pakistani forces opened heavy mortar fire, hitting civilian targets in the main Poonch town.

However, when the charade was found out, Pakistan 'arrested' Mir and put him in prison.Mir's case has come handy as India reminded the world of Pakistan's duplicity, with foreign secretary Vikram Misri bringing him up twice since launch of Operation Sindoor.Misri said, ""Pakistan has been known to wilfully mislead the world and international forums such as FATF. In the Sajid Mir case, this terrorist was declared dead, and then, in response to international pressure, brought back to life, found alive and arrested."" According to sources, acceptance of Mir's existence by Pakistan was a desperate attempt to get off the 'grey list' of FATF.When pressure mounted on Pakistan with the search for perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks , Islamabad denied Mir's existence declared him dead in 2021. Mir was, on paper, lodged in the central jail in Lahore after being 'sentenced' for eight years by a Pakistan 'anti-terrorism court' on charges of terror financing . He was detained in April 2022 in a hush-hush affair while the jail term was awarded in June, just before a FATF meeting.Mir has a $5 million bounty announced by FBI, which has described him as someone who once wore a beard and hair down to his shoulders. He, according to the US agency, altered his appearance through plastic surgery.The US has held Mir responsible for directing preparations and reconnaissance and being one of the Pakistan-based controllers during the 26/11 attacks . In addition, Mir conspired to commit a terrorist attack against a newspaper and its employees in Denmark between 2008 and 2009.Mir, who would now be in his early 50s, was LeT's foreign recruiter and the main handler for Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley . A US justice department document mentioned how the 26/11 attackers were in real-time telephonic contact with Mir and his associates during the attacks. On Mir's advice, Headley changed his name of 'Dawood Gilani' to 'David Coleman Headley' in order to facilitate his activities on behalf of the LeT by enabling him to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani.",Sajid Mir had been loaned to LeT - a common practice used by the ISI to groom young jihadis.

In a post on X, BSF Jammu confirmed, “At around 2300 hours on 8 May 2025, BSF foiled a major infiltration bid at the International Boundary in Samba district, J&K.”This development comes amid a wider escalation of hostilities following India’s recent military actions under ‘Operation Sindoor’.The operation, launched on 7 May, targeted nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. These camps were reportedly linked to terror groups including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The strikes were said to be in direct retaliation for the 22 April terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 28 civilians.Defence sources have indicated that the Indian Army also brought down two Pakistani drones in the Naushera sector, during intense artillery exchanges along the Line of Control. Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports emerged of a Pakistani Air Force jet being shot down in Punjab’s Pathankot sector, though official verification is awaited.Pakistan reportedly attempted to hit military targets in Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur using drones and missiles. The Integrated Defence Staff said these threats were “neutralised using kinetic and non-kinetic means” and confirmed that there were no casualties. Several incoming missiles, aimed at strategic locations including Jammu Airport in Satwari, Samba, RS Pura, and Arnia, were intercepted by Indian air defence systems. Loud explosions and subsequent blackouts were reported across Jammu and in parts of Rajasthan, where residents were alerted by sirens.Union Home Minister Amit Shah convened an urgent security meeting on Thursday, bringing together heads of all border-guarding agencies to assess preparedness.

Pahalgam was original escalation: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-was-original-escalation-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121011385.cms,"NEW DELHI: Debunking Pakistan's claim that India had targeted the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project in POK in the May 7 military strikes on terrorist camps and infrastructure, the govt warned Pakistan of serious consequences if it used that ""blatant lie"" as a pretext for launching an attack on any infrastructure project in India. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also said it was Pakistan that was responsible for the original escalation in the form of the Pahalgam attack and the choice of de-escalation too was with Pakistan.With Pakistan looking to inject a communal element into India's actions, Misri hit back by linking the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan army chief Asim Munir's April 16 speech in which he had stressed the two-nation theory and ""stark differences between Hindus and Muslims"".""You are aware of the kind of religious profiling that was done there (Pahalgam) and perhaps there is a linkage between these two events. I think that (speech) is the last word in communal rhetoric,"" he said.Accusing India of attacking the Neelum-Jhelum project, Pakistan's defence minister Khwaja Asif had said ""this is not something we will sweep under the rug"". When such a line was crossed, he had said, a response became inevitable.Misri strongly denied Pakistan's claim, describing it as an absolute fabrication and a blatant lie. ""India has targeted only and only terrorist infrastructure, and details of that terrorist infrastructure, together with the locations, were shared yesterday,"" he said.""I should note that if this kind of a claim is a pretext for targeting Indian infrastructure of a similar nature, Pakistan will be entirely responsible for the consequences that will undoubtedly follow,"" he said.Briefing journalists about developments on the second day of Operation Sindoor , Misri said Pakistan had unleashed a disinformation war against India with its claims Indian govt was responsible for the current escalation and there were no terrorists in Pakistan.""There are several terrorist attacks around the world where Pakistani fingerprints have been found. I don't need to belabour the point about where Osama bin Laden was found and who called him a martyr,"" Misri said, adding that Pakistan has for decades pursued cross-border terrorism into India with impunity. He said India would provide more information soon to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee about UN-proscribed terror group LeT's links with TRF.On Pakistan's claim only civilians were killed in India's May 7 strikes, Misri displayed a photograph showing senior Pakistan army officers at a funeral and wondered why it was being carried out with coffins draped in Pakistani flags and state honours being accorded. ""As far as we are concerned, the individuals eliminated at these facilities were terrorists. Giving terrorists state funerals may be a practice in Pakistan, but it doesn't seem to make much sense to us,"" he said.On Pakistan's claim that several Indian jets had been downed during the op, Misri said India will share information at an appropriate time. ""Pakistan has been lying since it was born in 1947,"" he said.While Pakistan has accused India of deliberately targeting mosques, Misi said it was Islamabad that was misusing religious sites as a cover to radicalise, direct, indoctrinate and train terrorists. He added it was Pakistan which attacked a gurdwara in Poonch in firing across the LoC, and killed three members of the Sikh community.Addressing what he described as Pakistan's disinformation on the Indus Waters Treaty, Misri accused Islamabad of acting in violation of the treaty, deliberately creating legal roadblocks in India exercising its legitimate rights on the western rivers. ""Any projects that India sought to build on the eastern rivers, and even on the western rivers, which we are allowed to by the treaty, were always challenged by Pakistan, thereby hampering our rights to utilise our legitimate waters under the treaty,"" he said, adding that Pakistan's persistent refusal to respond to India's request for a modification of the treaty was itself a violation of the treaty.","India warns Pakistan of serious consequences if it used ""blatant lie"" as a pretext for launching an attack on any infrastructure project in India.

In 1965, 1971 and during Operation Parakram , we were evacuated. The Army was everywhere, and you could feel the war coming.""""Back then, there was palpable fear, and we had no choice but to leave.

""Today, the tension feels more subtle - almost invisible - but no less real. The Army has advanced technology now, and though we can't always see them, we trust they have things under control,"" he remarked.Sukha Singh, 71, a resident of neighbouring border village of Neshta, recalls the 1965 war , noting how media was limited to radios.

However, he expressed disappointment over PM Narendra Modi's absence from the meeting.

We need to ask the United States to designate it as a foreign terrorist organisation,"" he said. Sources said Owaisi raised concerns about online abuse targeting Himanshi Narwal, wife of naval officer Vinay Narwal, one of the 26 people killed in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: Banking on the forecast of a good monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, govt on Thursday set a target of record foodgrain output of 354 million tonne (MT) for the 2025-26 crop year (July-June), which is nearly 4% higher than the target of 2024-25 and over 6.5% more than the actual production of 2023-24.The foodgrains basket comprises of paddy, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses.The target, set after taking inputs from all states, was discussed during a national conference on Kharif campaign where policy makers and farm scientists brainstormed over preparedness and availability of adequate inputs (quality seeds, fertilisers, etc.) ahead of the sowing season.IMD had last month predicted 'above normal' rainfall for most parts of the country, including the 'monsoon core zone', where farmers depend on seasonal rainfall. Good monsoon rains (June-Sept) invariably help farmers in having bumper output.Addressing the conference, agriculture minister Shivraj Chouhan announced a pan-India 15-day campaign (May 29-June 12) to create awareness among 1-1.5 crore farmers, across 700 districts, about climate-resilient seed varieties, availability of fertilisers, monsoon forecast and benefits of govt programmes.""Farm scientists and officials will be among farmers during the campaign. There are 16,000 farm scientists in India and there is a need that farmers and scientists should work together,"" said Chouhan.He said that the Centre will consider making amendments in the Seeds Act, 1966 to curb sales of spurious seeds, ensure seeds traceability and protect farmers interest.

Live-ins presume consent if sustained over time: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/live-ins-presume-consent-if-sustained-over-time-supreme-court/articleshow/121009911.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Observing the increasing prevalence of live-in relationships in recent years, Supreme Court has stated that if two able-minded adults reside together as live-in partners for more than a couple of years, a presumption would arise that they voluntarily chose that kind of relationship, fully aware of its consequences. Therefore, allegation that such a relationship was entered into based on a promise of marriage may be deemed unworthy of acceptance.While quashing criminal proceedings against a man who was accused of rape charges by his live-in partner, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra said physical relationship continued for over two years without a complaint in between and a presumption would arise of there being a valid consent for initiating and maintaining the physical relationship.""A decade or two earlier, live-in relationships might not have been common. But now more and more women are financially independent and have the capacity to take conscious decision of charting their life on their own terms. This financial freedom, inter alia, has led to proliferation of such live-in relationships. Therefore, when a matter of this nature comes to a court, it must not adopt a pedantic approach rather the court may, based on the length of such relationship and conduct of the parties, presume implied consent of the parties to be in such a relationship regardless of their desire or a wish to convert it into a marital bond,"" the court said.In a similar verdict, SC in March had held a woman who was in a live-in relationship for a long period may not be able to accuse her live-in partner of compelling her to get into physical relation on the false promise of marriage in order to face rape charges as it could not be be said with certainty that physical relationship was purely because of the promise.The court had said in such cases even if it was assumed that a false promise of marriage was made to complainant initially by accused, the fact that relationship continued for such a long period would render the plea of the complainant, that her consent for all these years was under misconception of the fact that the accused would marry her, implausible.",Supreme Court quashes criminal proceedings against a man who was accused of rape by his live-in partner. Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra said physical relationship continued for over two years without a complaint in between.

The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport



Customs order and penalties



₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such blanket assumptions may not stand up to judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Poll Who do you think was the key player for India in their victory over Pakistan? Kranti Goud Harleen Deol

NEW DELHI: India secured a commanding 88-run victory over neighbours Pakistan in the ongoing ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo on Sunday.The win extended India's unbeaten record against Pakistan to 12-0 in ODIs under the leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur The match proceeded with expected patterns, though notably without the usual hostilities. India maintained their ""no-handshake"" policy at the toss and after the match, following the precedent set from the just concluded men's Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE.The game featured some unexpected moments, including a toss mishap, an unusual run out, and a 15-minute delay due to bugs on the field.""Very happy, very important game for all of us, and I'm sure everyone back home is happy as well,"" Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation.India batted first after being sent in and posted 247 runs before being dismissed. Harleen Deol contributed 46 runs while Richa Ghosh added a quick 35 not out, though most batters struggled to convert their starts on the slow pitch.""It wasn't an easy pitch to bat on, we wanted to bat longer and see how many runs we can get.It wasn't an easy pitch. It's been raining, and there was a hold on the pitch. We wanted to keep wickets in hand. The key was keeping wickets, Richa batted really well and gave us that crucial 30 runs,"" Harmanpreet said.Pakistan's chase began poorly as they lost three early wickets, falling to 26 for 3 by the eighth over. They were eventually bowled out for 159 in 43 overs.Sidra Amin stood out for Pakistan with a fighting 81 runs off 106 balls, while Natalia Pervaiz contributed 33 runs.India's bowling attack proved effective with Kranti Goud taking 3/20 and Deepti Sharma claiming 3/45. Shree Charani also contributed with 2/38.""Our bowling was great. Kranti bowled really well, she was outstanding and Renuka helped her in getting the breakthroughs. We created so many chances, unfortunately, we dropped it, but in the end when you win you are happy,"" Harmanpreet said.""There are a lot of areas but we are happy we won, just want to go with the momentum. Now we go back to India, we know how the pitches play there, we will look at the combinations and what team we need to play,"" Harmanpreet said regarding areas for improvement.","India secure 88-run victory over Pakistan in ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025.

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1, 2025.“Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on October 1, but the timeline was pushed back. The new announcement marks the latest step in his broader tariff agenda aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.As per Bloomberg, the 25% duties are part of Trump’s expanding trade measures designed to “protect domestic industries.” The decision follows a probe launched in April by the US commerce department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose import taxes on goods considered vital to national security.The investigation focused on medium- and heavy-duty trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds and their components, noting that a “small number” of foreign suppliers dominate the market due to “predatory trade practices.”Last month, Trump introduced a series of tariff announcements — including 100% on pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture — set to begin in October.At the time, he said the 25% tariff on heavy trucks would safeguard major American truck manufacturers such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner and Mack Trucks.“In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing a 25% Tariff,” Trump wrote then, describing the move as essential to keeping the nation’s truckers “financially healthy and strong” for “national security purposes”.Trump has defended his protectionist measures as a strategy to promote domestic production, despite criticism that higher import duties could increase costs for consumers and businesses.",US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States.

NEW DELHI: A major fire broke out on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway late Tuesday night after a truck carrying LPG cylinders collided with another vehicle near the Dudu area, officials said.The impact of the crash triggered multiple explosions as gas cylinders began to burst, sending flames and shockwaves across the stretch. The blaze and loud explosions were visible and audible from several kilometres away, according to news agency PTI.Police personnel and fire brigades rushed to the scene, halting traffic on both sides of the busy highway.Rescue and firefighting operations continued late into the night as teams worked to bring the situation under control.

It quoted him as saying he did not want to fight and had surrendered before Ukrainian forces.Confirming last month that there were 27 Indian nationals still serving in the Russian army , the Indian foreign ministry had urged Indian nationals to stay away from the offers being made to serve in the Russian army as they were fraught with danger and risk to life.Majoti appeared on a video recorded by Ukraine's 63rd Mechanised Brigade, saying that he was sentenced to seven years in a Russian prison on drug-related charges. He was offered the opportunity to sign a contract with the Russian military to avoid further punishment, said the Kyiv Independent.Ukrainian authorities quoted him as saying he did not want to fight, needed help and also didn't want to go back to Russia as ""there is no truth there"".

Kumar took PSO's pistol, saying he had 'some work to do'

CHANDIGARH: Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar (52), known as an outspoken IPS officer who flagged irregularities, including alleged caste bias, in his own department, was found dead from a gunshot to the head at his Chandigarh residence Tuesday afternoon.The incident happened a day before he was to take up his new assignment as head of Police Training Centre, Sunaria.Police said Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, shot himself with his gunman's service revolver in the soundproofed basement of his brother-in-law's house in Sector 11. According to a police release, a will and nine-page ""final note"" left by the ADG were recovered along with the weapon. Sources said the note named a few serving and retired IPS officers but didn't divulge its content.His wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar - civil aviation secretary and commissioner & secretary, women and child development dept in Haryana govt - was in Japan as part of a delegation.A native of Andhra, Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar belonged to the Scheduled Caste community. He held a BE-computer science degree and was an IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus. He repeatedly challenged his own department, not hesitating to move court, and had once complained against former Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava, accusing him of discrimination.He was last posted as IG-Rohtak Range before being transferred to the training centre on Sept 29. He went on leave and was due to join his new posting on Wednesday.Investigators are struggling to establish a timeline since the basement, which Kumar had converted into his office, was soundproof. So far, they have learnt that Kumar had asked his gunman to give him his service pistol around 1 pm Tuesday, saying he had ""some work to do"", and proceeded to the basement. No one heard the gunshot - not his daughter, the securitymen, house staff, passersby, nor some labourers working at a plot nearby.About an hour later, when Kumar's daughter went to the basement, she found him lying on the sofa, bleeding from the head.

4,078 Days As PM: Modi Tops Indira Gandhi, Now Behind Jawaharlal Nehru In India's Longest PM Streaks

NEW DELHI: On a day that marked the beginning of his 25th continuous year on a constitutional post - he first took office as Gujarat CM in 2001 - PM Narendra Modi emphasised his resolve to work even harder towards realising ""country's collective dream of a Viksit Bharat"".""Thanks to the continuous blessings of my fellow Indians, I am entering my 25th year of serving as the head of a government. Through all these years, it has been my constant endeavour to improve lives of our people and contribute to the progress of this great nation that has nurtured us all,"" the PM remarked, posting a series of messages on X Tuesday.Reflecting on his journey - 11 years as PM and 13 years as Gujarat CM - Modi recalled the formidable challenges he had encountered as Gujarat's CM. He drew parallels with the hurdles he faced on becoming PM in 2014, when the nation was grappling with a profound ""crisis of trust and governance"".""Over past 11 years, we the people of India have worked together and achieved many transformations. Our path-breaking efforts have empowered citizens from all corners of the country, especially Nari Shakti, Yuva Shakti, and hardworking Annadatas. Over 25 crore people have been lifted from the clutches of poverty,"" Modi said.Turning to his Gujarat tenure, he evoked the dire circumstances of his appointment: the state was reeling from the impact of an earthquake, compounded by a super cyclone, successive droughts and political turmoil. ""Those challenges only strengthened my resolve to serve the people and rebuild Gujarat with renewed vigour and hope,"" he shared.Modi recalled, ""When I took oath as CM, I remember my mother telling me: '...I seek two things. You will always work for the poor; second, never take a bribe'.""Lauding his achievements, home minister Amit Shah said the ""Karma Yogi"" PM exemplified how ""Nation First"" and ""Developed India"" vision can catalyse transformation in the lives of crores.When Modi was sworn in as Gujarat 14th CM on Oct 7, 2001, he had never contested an election before. That didn't stop him from giving a new direction and impetus to Gujarat's development journey.","PM Narendra Modi marks 25th continuous year as head of a government.

'Every Time There's An Election...': TMC MP Mahua Moitra Exposes BJP's 'Hindu-Muslim Danga' Strategy

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine a plea to lodge an FIR against hate speech for a video being circulated by Assam BJP in support of its claim that Muslims would take over the state if BJP goes out of office.The application has been filed by former Patna high court judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali who alleged that the video ""targets, vilifies and demonises Muslims"".Appearing for petitioners before a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta, advocate Nizam Pasha, submitted that though the offensive video uploaded on 'X' targeted one community in violation of apex court's order, no action has been taken.He also pleaded the court to pass directions for the video to be taken off social media and direct lodging of an FIR.The bench, after a brief hearing, issued notice and posted the case for further hearing to October 28.""The video has been circulated by the BJP Assam Unit on Sept 15 on its official X handle viz. ""BJP Assam Pradesh"" showing a grossly false narrative that depicts the takeover of Assam by Muslims if the BJP doesn't remain in power in Assam.The video depicts the consequences of a change in the present ruling dispensation and inter alia shows visibly Muslim people (wearing skull caps and burqas) taking over tea estates, Guhawati airport, Guhawati Accolad, Assam Ranghar, Guhawati Stadium, Guhawati Town,"" the petition said.They pleaded that the video should be be taken down immediately to contain any further spread of communal disharmony, unrest and enmity.""It is submitted that the aforementioned video shows the gross failure as well as the complete disregard of secular values that the ruling dispensation of any State of our country is bound to uphold. It is further submitted that a state government, elected and formed under the Constitution of India, is the guardian of all communities and is specifically prohibited by the Constitution from engaging in discrimination inter alia on the basis of religion, race, caste, gender, language. Thus, the burden of being fair, just and secular is far greater on an elected govt. In this regard it is pertinent to note that even private citizens are prohibited under law from making communal speeches or spreading communal disharmony,"" the application said.They said the ruling dispensation of Assam is bound by the Constitution and thereby is bound to uphold the secular values that form part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Terming hate speech as a ""serious offence"" which could affect the secular fabric of the country, the Supreme Court in 2023 had directed police in all states and UTs to take suo motu action and register cases against those making such speeches irrespective of their religion without waiting for a formal complaint.","The application has been filed by former Patna high court judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali.

SBI’s fraud tag on Anil & RCom has no infirmity: HC

MUMBAI: Bombay high court has said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures, reported as fraud and debarred from raising funds or seeking credit facilities, as they were responsible for the acts or omissions of the company.The high court said so while dismissing Anil Ambani ’s challenge to an SBI order that termed Reliance Communications ’ (RCom’s) loan account as “fraud” and reported his name to Reserve Bank of India under fraud detection guidelines.For Anil Ambani , senior counsel Darius Khambata said despite the fact that there were no allegations against Ambani in a show-cause notice of December 2023, and he was not a whole-time director of the company, his name was reported.HC said the law was well settled and there was no need to spell out specific allegations against the promoter and director having control over the company, which, in this case, Ambani had during the relevant period. Ambani’s defence argued principles of natural justice were flouted as he was given no personal hearing before his name was reported too, and also similar orders against other non-executive directors were dropped.The HC, in a reasoned judgment available Tuesday, said “the role of the other directors, who were exonerated, was different and distinct from that of the present petitioner, inasmuch as they were non-executive directors and were not responsible for the day-to-day functioning of RCOM.”SBI had said it reported Ambani’s name under terms of Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks and All India Financial Institutions dated 15 July 2024.An HC division bench on October 3 found the SBI order to be a reasoned one sans any infirmity and Ambani’s petition challenging it with “no merit” and dismissed it.HC said the show cause notice detailed the basis of the declaration of fraud as contemplated by SBI. It said the erstwhile non-executive director failed to reply and continued to seek documents, leading to SBI finally proceeding to pass the order.HC said principles of natural justice don’t have a straitjacket formula, but so long as Ambani was “afforded an adequate opportunity to submit his objections in writing, the requirement of fairness and compliance with the principle of natural justice stood satisfied.”"," Bombay high court said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures.

On this day twenty-five years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took oath as the chief minister of Gujarat — a moment that would shape not just his political journey but also the trajectory of the Bharatiya Janata Party Under his leadership, the BJP has grown exponentially, expanding its footprint across states and consolidating its influence at the Centre.As he completes a 25 years in public service, here’s looking at his major milestonesAlso read: 'On this day ...': PM Modi shares nostalgic pictures on day he first became Gujarat CM Appointed Gujarat’s chief minister in 2001 to replace Keshubhai Patel, PM Modi took charge amid post-earthquake challenges and political instability. He led the BJP to three consecutive assembly wins — in 2002, 2007, and 2012 — becoming the state’s longest-serving CM. His governance style in the state came to be known as the “Gujarat Model”.2014 was a watershed moment. He led the BJP to its first solo majority in three decades, ending the coalition era and reducing Congress to 44 seats. This victory marked the end of coalition politics and established the BJP as a dominant force. Congress experienced its worst-ever performance. As a result, there was no official leader of the opposition in the 16th Lok Sabha, as a party needed at least 10% of the seats (55 seats) to qualify.Surpassing predecessors like Dr. Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PM Modi now ranks as the third longest-serving Prime Minister of the country. This feat makes him the first non-Congress leader to achieve such a long and consequential tenure, a period exceeded only by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.Under PM Modi's leadership, the BJP delivered two stunning electoral performances. In 2014 and 2019, the BJP won 282 and 303 Lok Sabha seats respectively — both clear majorities. Even in 2024, though the party fell short of a solo majority with 240 seats, the NDA coalition retained power with the support of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.PM Modi's approval ratings consistently rank among the highest for global democratic leaders. According to global intelligence firm Morning Consult, Prime Minister Modi's domestic approval rating consistently hovers around 75%. His approval rating is over 30 points higher than that of the US President Donald Trump.The BJP’s geographical growth under his tenure has been transformative. When he took office nationally in 2014, the NDA governed seven states. By mid-2024, the coalition had successfully expanded its rule to more than 18 states. The party’s presence deepened in regions once seen as out of bounds, from the Northeast to southern India.Leveraging digital platforms for immediate communication, PM Modi is one of the most followed world leaders, commanding over 108 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter. His adept use of social media has created a direct communication channel with citizens, bypassing traditional media filters.The party’s parliamentary strength has grown dramatically, increasing from 161 Lok Sabha and 49 Rajya Sabha seats in 2013 to a current strength of 240 and 102, respectively. Furthermore, the Congress's failure to secure the required 10% seats meant the leader of opposition post remained vacant for two consecutive terms (2014 and 2019).Illustrating the surge in popular support, the BJP’s national vote share saw a 12-point jump, rising sharply from 18.8% in 2009 to 31% in 2014. It peaked in 2019 to 37.36% before a marginal dip in 2024, when the NDA still formed the government.Under his leadership, India’s economic scale has achieved a significant milestone, more than doubling its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in under ten years. India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. India is now the 4th largest economy in the world, in nominal GDP terms, overtaking Japan, and is behind only the US, China, and Germany. According to the IMF, India’s GDP currently stands at $4.3 trillion.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi marks 25 years of public service. Modi is the third longest-serving Prime Minister of the country.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday announced a holiday for government and government-aided schools from October 8 to October 18 to allow teachers involved in the ongoing social and educational survey, known as the 'caste survey', to complete their work.The survey was originally scheduled to end on October 7. However, progress has been uneven across districts, prompting the government to extend the deadline by 10 days.""We were supposed to end the survey on October 7.

The chief minister gave an example, saying Koppal has 97 per cent of the survey completed, while Udupi and Dakshina Kannada stand at 63 and 60 per cent respectively. “Across the state, the survey is not yet fully complete as expected,” he added.The chief minister also announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh each for three staff members who died while working on the survey. Teachers engaged in mid-term examinations will be exempt from the survey.Earlier in the day, the Karnataka CM said he had no position on the Lingayat community’s demand for separate religious status, even as the opposition BJP accused him of trying to divide Hindu religion and society.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah announced a holiday for government and government-aided schools from October 8 to October 18.

What is Moscow format

NEW DELHI: India, along with other nations, on Tuesday, opposed the deployment of foreign military infrastructure on Afghan soil, effectively rejecting United States president Donald Trump's calls for handing over the Bagram airbase.The joint opposition came at the 7th Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, which included India, Afghanistan, Russia and China, Iran and Central Asian countries, including Pakistan.The countries described the presence of a foreign military in Afghanistan as ""unacceptable"" during the extensive deliberation on bringing prosperity and development to Afghanistan.“They called unacceptable the attempts by countries to deploy their military infrastructure in Afghanistan and neighbouring states, since this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability,” said a joint statement published by the Russian foreign ministry.The Indian delegation, led by Ambassador Vinay Kumar, reaffirmed India’s support for an independent, peaceful, and stable Afghanistan, along with the socioeconomic development and prosperity of its people, according to the Indian Embassy in Moscow.US president Donald Trump issued a warning to Afghanistan last month, demanding the return of Bagram Air Base to Washington or face consequences.“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, bad things are going to happen,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.The ultimatum follows remarks made earlier in the week during Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, where he revealed Washington was “trying to get it back.” Standing beside British prime minister Keir Starmer, he said, “We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us.”The issue underscores the base’s strategic significance. Its location gives access to volatile parts of Central and South Asia, while also offering a vantage point close to China’s sensitive Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear missile sites.Trump also complained that the United States had “gave it to them for nothing,” adding that Bagram is “exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.”Bagram Air Base, located in Afghanistan’s Parwan province, was a key strategic hub for the United States since the 2001 invasion. However, following the US withdrawal in 2021 and the Taliban ’s rapid re-invasion, the United States lost control of Bagram.Also read: What is the ‘insurrection act’?

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, Air India was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, Air India said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

CHENNAI: Sresan Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of toxic Coldrif cough syrup, purchased non-pharmaceutical grade of propylene glycol - a raw material for manufacture of drugs - but there was no invoice for the purchase, found drug inspectors who visited the company's Kancheepuram unit in Tamil Nadu on October 2.Four other syrups manufactured with propylene glycol as an excipient (medium for the drug) were found to be safe. Senior drug inspectors P Nithin Kumar in Kancheepuram and R Sasikumar in Thiruvallur found that the medicines in the unit were stored under ""unhygienic conditions"" - placed in corridors, and filled, labelled and dedusted in areas without air handling units.

The entire investigation was completed within two days, it said. The state drugs control department said there were no cases pending against him. Bhaskaran says that's because ""no one kept track or inspected the premises"".Ranganathan, 73, a pharmacy graduate from Madras Medical College, built his reputation over more than four decades as the man behind Pronit, a nutritional syrup that became popular in the 1980s. Its success was interrupted when the state drug control department intervened: the product was promoted as a 'nutritional food supplement', but the ingredients used in its making required prior approval from the state drug control department. Ranganathan was then forced to obtain a proper licence, regularising the product. Over the years, he came to head Sresan Pharmaceuticals.Now, his 2,000 sq ft unit along the Chennai-Bengaluru highway has been sealed, and his registered office in Kodambakkam remains locked.

NEW DELHI: While hearing NGO-petitioners against the special intensive revision of the Bihar electoral rolls on Tuesday, the Supreme Court said that since it appears that there is an appreciation of numbers from the draft rolls, to avoid any confusion, the identity of add-ons should be disclosed.""You'd agree with us that the degree of transparency and access has improved in the electoral process. It appears from the data that there was a 65-lakh deletion in the draft list which you published, and we said whoever is dead or moved is all right, but if you are deleting someone, please follow Rule 21 and the SOP.""""We also said that whoever is deleted, please put up their data in your electoral offices. Now the final list appears to be an appreciation of numbers and there is confusion in the general democratic process - what is the identity of the add-ons, are they of deleted names or new names,"" Justice Joymalya Bagchi said.With EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi insisting that the NGO represented by Prashant Bhushan should file affidavits by individuals alleging that their names were deleted without intimation, the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Bagchi wondered, ""For whom was this exercise undertaken (by the NGO)?""Senior advocate Maninder Singh recalled petitioner Yogendra Yadav bringing to the courtroom two voters whose names were deleted as dead and said, ""EC repeatedly requested the person concerned to give details of the two individuals to enable the commission to carry out necessary corrections.Till date no detail has been given.""The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We also have information about the two voters but do not want to disclose in open court."" While agreeing to hear Yadav for 30 minutes on Thursday, the bench told Bhushan to bring affidavits of people whose names were deleted without being informed about it.EC repudiated this by saying of the 65 lakh deleted names - 22 lakh deceased, 36 lakh permanently shifted and seven lakh enrolled at multiple places - not a single individual has filed an appeal against deletion. Dwivedi said no political party has facilitated a single person since Oct 1, when the final voter list was published, to file an appeal.When Bhushan sought details of the names deleted after SIR, EC said it can be easily verified by the NGO by comparing the Jan 2025 voter list and the final voter list published on Oct 1. Bhushan said it would be a very tedious exercise for the petitioner when the requisite information can be provided within minutes by the EC.When Bhushan continued to object to the way SIR was conducted, the bench said, ""We cannot be conducting a roving inquiry into the finalisation of electoral rolls by EC in exercise of its statutory duties. Our aim was to facilitate the poll panel in conducting the exercise smoothly and transparently.""","The Supreme Court said that since it appears that there is an appreciation of numbers from the draft rolls, to avoid any confusion, the identity of add-ons should be disclosed.

Augmentin unit value lower than Mounjaro’s

NEW DELHI: Soaring demand for weight-loss therapies has brought Eli Lilly's Mounjaro within striking distance of Indian pharma market's long standing market leader GlaxoSmithKline's Augmentin, an antibiotic.During September, Mounjaro recorded sales of Rs 80 crore, becoming the second-largest brand in the pharma retail market, latest data culled by TOI from market research firm Pharmatrac showed. As against this, Augmentin generated sales of Rs 85 crore during the month.Typically, top-selling medicines in the pharmaceutical market are either Augmentin or anti-diabetic therapy, Mixtard, which generates around Rs 75-80 crore in monthly sales. Launched in March this year, Mounjaro generated a cumulative revenue of Rs 233 crore by September.Industry experts said the introduction of Mounjaro in a pre-filled device, KwikPen, in August has boosted sales.A key reason for the sales is the higher unit value of the drug even though the volumes are lower. Average monthly cost of Mounjaro for a patient starts from Rs 14,000 and goes up to Rs 27,000, depending on the prescription.In contrast, a strip of 10 tablets of Augmentin 625 Duo costs under Rs 200.Sales of Mounjaro's rival, Wegovy, marketed by Novo Nordisk, have, however, plateaued around Rs 9 crore. The company is said to be cutting sales jobs, amid rising competition in the segment. Overall, the organised pharma retail market mopped up total sales of over Rs 20,000 crore in September, a growth of 7.3%, the latest data added. Market expansion was driven by new product introductions and price hikes, with all therapies reporting higher value.Augmentin and Glycomet GP continue to retain their leadership position at the MAT (moving annual total) level. Sept was also the month when the GST reduction from 18% to 5% was rolled out. A slight disturbance was seen in the distribution channel during the month, though there was no disruption at the retail level, experts said.","During September, Mounjaro recorded sales of Rs 80 crore, becoming the second- largest brand in the pharma retail market.

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Tuesday took serious note of rising discontent among more than 20,000 judicial officers, with those who joined the service at entry level alleging Tuesday that advocates directly recruited as district judges have scuttled their chances to head the district judiciary and be elevated as high court judges.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said a balance needs to be struck between the competing interests of entry-level judicial officers and those directly recruited for the post of district judges (DJs), and decided to refer the issue to a five-judge Constitution bench for a lasting solution.CJI Gavai said, ""A youngster who chooses a career in the judiciary and joins as a civil judge junior division at the age of 25 aspires to become a district judge and subsequent elevation to high court. It cannot be disputed that one who spends 25 years in judicial service is rich in experience and rightly aspires to become a high court judge.""He highlighted that there have been very few instances where a civil judge junior division has retired as a Supreme Court judge.But the CJI did not discount the fact that an advocate who joins as district judge through direct recruitment too aspires to at least become an HC judge. Generally, those who join the services at entry level have very little chance of becoming even a district judge given the large number of advocates recruited directly as district judges.",Those who joined the service at entry level allege that advocates directly recruited as district judges have scuttled their chances to head the district judiciary.

PM Modi To Inaugurate Navi Mumbai Airport On October 8: All About ₹19,650 Cr Aviation Marvel

NEW DELHI: Setting the ground for establishing an apex Transport Planning Authority, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of cabinet ministers and secretaries responsible for transport-related ministries, which will be tasked with the comprehensive planning for the entire transportation ecosystem.Sources said the best international examples were discussed in the meeting, including the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI), a think tank under the PMO in South Korea that provides recommendations and alternatives for the nation’s transport policy. They added that other models of preparing transport plans, including of China, were also discussed.“PM has been vocal about breaking silos and going for integrated planning of infrastructure development. He emphasised the need for integrated transport planning to get maximum results. The need of an ecosystem for this in India was discussed in detail, considering that at present there is no apex agency and each ministry has its own vision document. There is less inter-ministerial, state brainstorming and everything is mostly consultant driven,” said a source.TOI on Sept 23 had reported the government’s plan to set up an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transportation and end-to-end mobility.Sources said that due to a lack of such an entity there are no defined five-year or 10-year plans and the PM Gatishakti National Master Plan has become only a project appraisal platform. Moreover, there are multiple frameworks for monitoring projects and there is no agency to suggest global best practices and innovative methods of implementation. “There is also no agency to take up policy advocacy and recommend changes in Acts and rules. There is no mechanism of mid-course correction in case of failure,” said an official.As per the plan, a National Institute for Transport Planning will be set up while a Gati-Shakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation will be established in the cabinet secretariat.To begin with, the govt will constitute a Group of Transport Experts (GTE) in fields like transport planning, supply chain management, data science and network optimisation from IITs in Delhi, Chennai and BHU, and BITS (Pilani). This will provide technical support to the sectoral group of secretaries. The group will suggest appropriate plans for five, 10 and 15 years.","PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of cabinet ministers and secretaries responsible for transport-related ministries.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: Seat-sharing talks between Rashtriya Janata Dal and CPI (M-L) Liberation hit a roadblock with the Left party rejecting the offer of 19 seats - the same as what it contested in 2020 - from Tejaswi Yadav ’s party as against their demand for anywhere between 40 to 45 seats.The CPI (ML) leadership sees the proposal for 19 seats offered by RJD on Monday as neither ""dignified"" nor ""respectable"". However, on Tuesday the Left party decided to convey a fresh offer and sent a list of around 30 seats to RJD which sources said will be ""non-negotiable"".""The offer of 19 seats is unacceptable and there too they have changed a few seats. Now we have made an offer of around 30 seats which is non-negotiable,"" the source said.The ""ball is now in Tejaswi Yadav’s court,"" and “all options are open” is what a source in the party said when asked what would be the course of action if RJD does not agree to the proposal.Last time the Left party had won 12 out of 19 seats in the assembly polls and 2 out of the 3 seats it fought in Lok Sabha in 2024 as part of the ""Mahagathbandhan"". Currently it holds 11 seats in the assembly as 1 was lost in the bye-election of 2024.On RJD's attempts to tell Allies including the Congress to be realistic, the Left party sources when asked made it clear that it is Tejaswi Yadav who has to be “realistic” if he wants to be the CM of Bihar.Party sources say that in 2020 too they had asked for a higher number of seats but agreed to contest on 19 as it was the first time they were coming into the alliance in Bihar and delivered by winning 12.In 2024, Lok Sabha polls too while the Left party had asked for more seats they got 3 and of that their candidates won 2, sources said. “So, we have not just contested on the seats but also got votes and won seats for the alliance,” the party source said.This time besides seeking the 19 seats from 2020, CPI (M-L) has also included in its proposals seats in new districts like Dharbhanga, Madhubani, Nalanda, Gaya and even Champaran where it sees the potential to counter the NDA.The Mahagathbandhan led by RJD comprises Congress, the Left parties - CPI, CPI(M), and CPI(ML) – and Mukesh Sahni's Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP)."," CPI (M-L) Liberation rejects the offer of 19 seats from Tejaswi Yadav’s party.

The provision introduced in 2019 says that where failure on the part of designated authority, contractor, consultant or concessionaire responsible for complying with standards for road design, construction and maintenance, results in death or disability, such authority or contractor or concessionaire shall be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.However, there has not been a single instance when this provision was enforced and any penalty imposed in the past six years. “The directive to hold people accountable is important as at present it’s easy to pass the buck. But to enforce this, there must be a proper scientific investigation into any crash,” said a road safety expert.The court’s directive for establishment of a simple and effective online grievance redressal mechanism by the landowning agencies to deal with complaints pertaining to lack of maintenance of footpaths and the requirement of pedestrian crossings is also crucial considering there is no such system in place at present.The SC has also directed the authorities to respond to complaints within a specified timeframe and ensure that the issue is resolved in a time-bound manner.“The grievance redressal system must incorporate a review mechanism by higher authorities, to be invoked in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the resolution provided,” the order said.Taking cognizance of accidents caused by wrong-lane driving, the court directed state transport departments, traffic police authorities and urban local bodies to enforce lane discipline by using automated cameras, graduated fines, coloured and textured lane markings, dynamic lighting, rumble strips and tyre killers at critical accident-prone points.The court has also instructed the road transport ministry, state transport departments and traffic police authorities to prescribe maximum permissible luminance and beam angles for vehicle headlights and ensure compliance through checks during PUC testing and vehicle fitness certification, and conduct targeted drives to penalise non-compliant or modified headlights.“A complete ban on unauthorised red–blue strobe flashing lights and illegal hooters shall be enforced through seizure, market crackdowns and penalties,” it said.","Supreme Court orders govts to hold officials and contractors personally liable in cases of pedestrian deaths caused due to infrastructural or design issues.

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times. Still, as Dreger put it, “He’s a unicorn.” The Oilers may be anxious, but the next move and the franchise’s future, ultimately depends on when McDavid decides the time is right.","Connor McDavid is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract.

Matthew Knies reveals shocker about girlfriend Ella Huber



Why Matthew Knies is still keeping his focus on the Leafs’ big goals



It’s been a busy off-season for the Toronto Maple Leafs, with key extensions and big roster moves making headlines. Amid all the contract news and locker-room optimism, one story stood out for its raw human touch. Rising Leafs star Matthew Knies, who recently appeared on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, revealed something unexpectedly emotional about his girlfriend, Ella Huber—a moment that reminded fans that even NHL stars face bittersweet turns in life.While Knies’ six-year, team-friendly deal with Toronto drew plenty of praise, it wasn’t his contract that grabbed everyone’s attention during his podcast appearance. Instead, it was a heartfelt revelation about Huber, who was recently drafted into the PWHL by the Boston Fleet.During the chat, producer Mike Grinnell asked Knies where he was most excited to travel this season, subtly hinting at Boston. Unaware of the connection at first, Knies answered “Anaheim and Vegas,” before realizing the joke. But when the topic turned serious, Knies admitted just how close his girlfriend was to joining him in Toronto.“Toronto had the next pick, so that’s a huge bummer, but it happens... I think we kind of had it pretty locked in [the Sceptres selecting Huber], I mean, it happens,” Knies shared candidly.Huber was chosen by Boston with the second pick in the second round, while the Toronto Sceptres went on to select forward Emma Gentry. For Knies, it was a bittersweet twist—his team’s hometown counterpart nearly drafted the woman he loves.Despite the emotional moment, Knies didn’t let disappointment overshadow his team-first mindset. His humble tone throughout the interview reflected his grounded personality—something that’s quickly made him a fan favorite in Toronto.Knies’ willingness to sign a deal worth under $8 million per season, when he could have easily asked for more, speaks volumes about his commitment to the Leafs’ long-term success. Alongside captain John Tavares, who also agreed to a surprisingly modest extension, Knies is helping set a new tone in the locker room—one built on loyalty, balance, and shared goals.As the 2025–26 season approaches, Knies has his eyes set on leading the Leafs back to the top of the Atlantic Division and chasing that elusive Stanley Cup. And while the distance between Toronto and Boston may test his relationship, it’s clear that Knies and Huber share the same drive—to succeed, no matter where the ice takes them.Also Read: Can the Panthers complete a three-peat?

Scindia and governors/chief ministers/ministers of Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim.Shah said that the Modi government has accomplished the most important task of establishing peace in the Northeast. In the past 10 years, several peace agreements have been signed and about 10,574 armed youths have surrendered and joined the mainstream, bringing peace to the Northeast and laying the foundation for development. In the last 10 years, he said, violent incidents in the northeast have reduced by 71%, and civilian deaths have reduced by 86%, thanks to the various peace agreements and boundary dispute settlement accords signed by the Modi regime.Stating that it is now time to give a big push to the country’s efforts to become a 5 trillion dollar economy through the development of northeast, Shah said the ministries of DONER and the North Eastern Council (NEC) are working to implement the mantra of “Act East, Act Fast, and Act First” to achieve this.Praising NEC for having served as an important platform over the past 50 years for discussing the aspirations, needs, and potential solutions to challenges before thr northeast, Shah said it has become the blueprint for the development of the region.

He underlined that it is crucial for the northeast to attract industrial investment, and efforts to accelerate this need to be intensified.With preparations underway to fully implement three new criminal laws across all the states in the Northeast, Shah said the focus of the police, now that violence has almost ceased in the Northeast, must be on ensuring that every citizen in the region is granted their constitutional rights to property, honor, and family protection.",Home minister Amit Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and sensitivity for development of the northeast region has worked.

""Under such circumstances, the offence committed against such a child needs to be viewed strictly...sexual offences cause physical, emotional, psychological, and social trauma to the victim,"" said special judge JP Darekar.The judge further said that non-examination of any other independent witness does not carry much weight. ""It is the settled principle of law that conviction can be based only on the oral testimony of the victim...the evidence of the victim is inspiring confidence. Therefore, the benefit of non-production of the Chemical Analysis Report is not given to the accused,"" the judge said.Two months prior to the incident in June 2019, the mother returned from her hometown with her daughter (the victim), who stayed with her maternal grandmother, for medical treatment. She began residing with the accused. The complainant worked night shifts.

He also engaged in unnatural sexual acts with her against her will.The mother attempted to contact the accused by phone, but he claimed to be returning home and failed to do so.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday expressed shock over the reports that lieutenant government (LG) VK Saxena had given the Enforcement Directorate (ED) approval to prosecute party chief Arvind Kejriwal in a liquor policy case , with the rival BJP calling the former Delhi CM ""kingpin"" of the ""scam"".Fresh trouble mounted for AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday when LG Saxena gave his sanction to the ED to prosecute Kejriwal in a case that has trapped the party in a legal labyrinth for the past few years The central investigating agency sought Saxena's nod to prosecute Kejriwal earlier this month after it allegedly found a ""huge level of corruption in framing and implementation"" of the excise policy, which was mentioned in prosecution complaint no. 7 filed in the Rouse Avenue court on May 17 this year.The court took cognisance of the complaint on July 9.Reacting to the development, Delhi health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj expressed shock over the reports and claimed there was no prosecution sanction issued in this regard.""I am shocked...don't they have the basic knowledge that prosecution sanction is required to prosecute a chief minister or a minister? They are saying that today they have given sanction to prosecute (Arvind Kejriwal), what was the BJP doing for the last two years? If they did not have permission to prosecute (Arvind Kejriwal), what were they doing? We have information that there is no prosecution sanction today also. This is part of a conspiracy being pushed for political reasons,"" Bhardwaj told news agency ANI.Another senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh called the reports on Kejriwal's prosecution ""fake"" and asked LG Saxena to make the letter public.""This fake news has been circulating since the morning. I don't know what is the source of this information. If Delhi LG has given any sanction, then he should make it public. Where is that letter of the sanction? If the ED (Enforcement Directorate) has been given the nod to prosecute (Kejriwal), the LG should show the letter. It is important to have evidence before running such baseless news. Delhi LG has given no such letter,"" Sanjay Singh, who is AAP Rajya Sabha MP, told ANI.Meanwhile, Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Virendra Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of being the ""kingpin"" of Delhi's liquor scam and stated that the ex-CM would be punished for his alleged involvement in the excise policy case.""It is clear that Arvind Kejriwal is the 'kingpin' of the Delhi Excise Policy scam and he has looted Delhi. We have been saying this since the first day that once you are out on bail, it is not evidence of your innocence. As the investigation progresses, Arvind Kejriwal is the culprit in this and will be punished,"" Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva told ANI.On Friday, the Delhi high court granted the ED additional time to file its reply to the petition filed by Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, challenging the trial court's decision to take cognisance of the chargesheets in the Delhi excise liquor policy case.The matter has been scheduled for hearing on February 5 by the bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri.","LG VK Saxena gave his sanction to the ED to prosecute Kejriwal in a case that has trapped the party in a legal labyrinth.

This sends the message that the government is doing injustice. He did not even bother to inquire about the condition of the injured,"" he added.Owaisi further criticised the actor for failing to take responsibility in a situation that endangered the public, saying, ""Where is humanity? I also attend public meetings with thousands of people, and I ensure there is no stampede. I make sure that security around me doesn’t push people so that nobody is harmed.""Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy responded to Owaisi’s remarks, condemning Allu Arjun for continuing his roadshow and waving at the crowds despite the tragic stampede.""Despite police permission being denied, the actor attended the theatre where Pushpa 2 was screened on December 4. After the death of a woman in the stampede, the actor did not leave the cinema hall, prompting the police to force him out,"" Reddy said.The CM revealed that the theatre management had sought security from the police on December 2, ahead of the actor’s visit on December 4, but the application was denied due to concerns over crowd management. The situation escalated when Allu Arjun, before and after the screening, stood through the sunroof of his car to wave at the throngs of fans, sparking chaos as thousands jostled for a glimpse of the actor.Reddy further criticised film personalities who rallied around Allu Arjun after the incident, pointing out their lack of concern for the victims. ""Film personalities who rushed to meet him after his arrest should have shown empathy by visiting the boy who is undergoing treatment in the hospital after suffering injuries in the incident,"" he said.Following the stampede, police filed charges against Allu Arjun, his security team, and the theatre management at the Chikkadpally police station, based on a complaint from the deceased woman’s family.A 35-year-old woman lost her life in the stampede, and her eight-year-old son was hospitalised with injuries.","AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi alleged that that Telugu film star responded to the news of the stampede and death by saying, ""The film is going to be a hit now"" He was speaking about the incident at the Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad, where a stampede occurred during the screening of 'Pushpa 2'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116539476,imgsize-1014120,width-400,resizemode-4/116539476.jpg"
Candidates won't get poll booth CCTV footage: EC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/candidates-wont-get-poll-booth-cctv-footage-ec/articleshow/116548316.cms,"Congress to contest EC’s poll rules tweak in courts ‘right away



NEW DELHI: Election Commission has brought changes in electoral rules to specify that CCTV footage of poll booths will not come under the category of ""documents"" to be made available to contestants and general public. Before the amendment, the provision under Section 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules said ""all other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection"" with court permission.Congress was quick to latch on to the changes and accused the Modi govt and EC of hurting transparency and eroding the integrity of the electoral process, but the poll panel said it was done to protect the privacy of voters and for their safety.The changes were triggered after the Punjab and Haryana high court recently directed EC to provide copies of required documents related to the Haryana assembly elections to advocate Mehmood Pracha.He had filed a petition seeking the videography, CCTV camera footage, and copies of Forms 17-C Parts I and II related to the conduct of elections.The existing rules do not contain any specific obligation on part of EC to provide any videographic record or CCTV footage to the public. The detailed rules have a list of records which can be made public , after directions from a competent court. Friday’s amendment has added a line where Section 93, in sub-section (2), in clause (a), after the word ‘papers’, the words ‘as specified in these rules’ shall be inserted. By adding this clarification, EC has made it clear that ‘papers’ would not include any documents or electronic records which have not been specified in the rules.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said his party would challenge this amendment in courts “right away”. He said, “If there was ever a vindication of our assertions regarding eroding integrity of the electoral process managed by EC in recent times, this is it.”EC sources, however, justified the changes and said restriction of making available CCTV footage to anyone was to avoid mischief and for the safety concerns of voters. “Sharing of CCTV footage may have serious repercussions, specially in sensitive areas like J&K, Naxal-affected regions etc where secrecy is important and the lives of voters are at risk for participating in the democratic process,” a senior EC official said.All election papers and documents are otherwise available for public inspection. Candidates in any case have access to all documents, papers and records. “Even Pracha was entitled for all the records from his constituency,” the official added. Sources in EC said the rule mentioned election paper documents and did not in any way specifically refer to electronic records. “In order to remove this ambiguity and considering… potential misuse of CCTV footage of inside the polling station using AI by a single person, the rule has been amended…” an EC official said.",The changes were triggered after the Punjab and Haryana high court recently directed EC to provide copies of required documents to advocate Mehmood Pracha.

'Character assassination': Actor Allu Arjun on stampede row after CM Revanth Reddy's criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/character-assassination-actor-allu-arjun-on-stampede-row-after-cm-revanth-reddys-criticism/articleshow/116542222.cms,"Allu Arjun. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Telugu Actor Allu Arjun termed the accusations over the Sandhya Theatre stampede during the premiere of his film ' Pushpa 2: the Rule ' part of a campaign of ""character assassination"" as Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy on Saturday said the actor was denied permission for the visit by the police.The incident on December 4 led to the death of a woman, Revathi, and injuries to her son, Sri Tej.Allu Arjun in a press conference at his Jubilee Hills residence described the incident as ""very unfortunate"" and offered his condolences. “It is a very unfortunate incident. It is completely an accident. My condolences to the family. I am taking updates every hour about the condition of the child (hospitalised). His condition is improving, it is very good. There is a lot of misinformation, false allegations are being made. I don't want to blame any department or politician. My character is being assassinated,"" he said.The controversy escalated after AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi criticised the actor in the Telangana Assembly, alleging ""irresponsible behaviour"" during the tragedy. Owaisi without taking any name accused Arjun of continuing to watch the film despite being informed about the stampede. ""I do not want to name that famous film star, but as per my knowledge, when that film star was told that there was a stampede outside the theatre, two children had fallen and a woman had died, then that star smiled and said that 'the film is going to be a hit now,'"" Owaisi claimed.Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy condemned Allu Arjun’s actions, accusing him of holding a roadshow that worsened the crowd chaos. Speaking in the assembly, the CM said, “The police refused a request from AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi to facilitate the cast and crew’s visit to Sandhya Theatre, citing safety concerns. Despite this, the hero came to watch the movie and got out of the car roof, doing a roadshow at RTC X road.""Reddy described the aftermath, stating, ""The police saw their predicament and shifted them to a hospital where Revathi was declared dead on arrival. The boy was in a critical condition. After the stampede, the ACP went to ask the hero to leave to gain control of the mob. At first, the actor refused, saying that he would leave after finishing the movie. Then the DCP had to intervene, asking the hero to leave or he would be arrested as two people had already fallen outside.""The CM emphasised that no special privileges would be extended to anyone. “Protecting the lives of people is the highest priority of my government,” he said.Allu Arjun was arrested following the incident but secured bail from the Telangana High Court on December 16 after furnishing a bond of Rs 50,000. He expressed his concern for the injured victim, stating that he had been advised not to visit Sri Tej due to ""ongoing legal proceedings"" but assured support for his medical needs.Meanwhile, Pushpa 2: The Rule, directed by Sukumar and starring Rashmika Mandanna and Fahadh Faasil, continues to break box office records despite the controversy.","Allu Arjun calls the accusations over the Sandhya Theatre stampede during the premiere of his film'Pushpa 2: the Rule'part of a campaign of ""character assassination"" Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy on Saturday said the actor was denied permission for the visit by the police.

MUMBAI: Almost a month after the Maharashtra assembly election results (declared on Nov 23), portfolios in the new Mahayuti govt were allocated on Saturday evening.While CM Devendra Fadnavis has held on to the home portfolio which deputy CM Eknath Shinde was seeking, the Shiv Sena chief succeeded in retaining the key urban development, housing and public works departments.The other deputy CM, Ajit Pawar, has retained the finance and planning portfolios and has got excise too.Though Shinde did not get home in the CM’s list of portfolios approved by governor C P Radhakrishnan on the last day of the winter session, the allocation clearly indicates he is No. 2 in govt given the plum ministries he has got and the fact that he will control all the urban local bodies and key agencies like MMRDA, Cidco and MSRDC which are important for Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).Sena sources said that if not home, Shinde was keen on getting housing and MSDRC in addition to urban development, and BJP conceded these. Besides, Sena has managed to retain most of its existing portfolios from the previous Mahayuti govt.CM Fadnavis has kept energy, law and judiciary, general administration department, information and publicity departments.BJP’s Chandrashekhar Bawankule is revenue minister, while Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil has got water resources (Godavari and Krishna Valley Development Corporation). The water resources department has been split, with its other half comprising Vidarbha, Tapi and Konkan Development Corporation along with disaster management given to BJP’s Girish Mahajan.From Sena, Shambhuraj Desai has got tourism, mining and ex-servicemen’s welfare, Pratap Sarnaik has got transport, Uday Samant has retained the industries department along with Marathi language, Gulabrao Patil has been given water supply and sanitation, and Dada Bhuse has got school education while Sanjay Rathod has been given soil and water conservation.From BJP, Chandrakant Patil has got higher and technical education and parliamentary affairs, Ganesh Naik has got forests, while Atul Save has been allotted OBC welfare, dairy development and renewable energy departments.BJP’s Pankaja Munde has got environment and climate change and animal husbandry while her cousin, NCP’s Dhananjay Munde, has got food and civil supplies and consumer protection. Munde is the only MLC who is a minister in Mahayuti govt; all other ministers are MLAs.While NCP’s Hasan Mushrif will look after medical education, Dattatray Bharne has got sports and youth welfare, minorities development and waqf, and Aditi Tatkare has retained women and child development that runs the Ladki Bahin Yojana. NCP’s former deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal has been given food and drug administration and special assistance.","Deputy CM Eknath Shinde gets key urban development, housing and public works departments.

Referring to videos circulating on social media, Reddy criticised Allu Arjun for holding a roadshow and waving to the crowd despite the large gathering, which led to chaos.Reddy stated that the management of the theatre had submitted a request to the police on December 2, seeking security for the visit of top actors and others on December 4.

Late legends such as M F Husain, the barefoot painter, and S H Raza, known for his signature 'bindu', led the charge, alongside a new wave of contemporary talents such as Raghav Babbar and Tanya Goel, states the survey released by Artsy, an online marketplace for buying and selling fine art.With a 32% jump in 'year-on-year inquiry growth', India-followed by Switzerland, Scotland, Brazil and Mexico-topped the list of nations with artistic clout.The report is based on messages from potential collectors to galleries about artworks they are interested in purchasing, the survey.In recent years, artworks from India have seen an upswing in overseas recognition and interest in both the established and emerging segments of the market. According to 2024 Hurun India Art List , sales by top 50 artists reached a record-breaking Rs 301 crore, a 19% increase from 2023.""The more established Indian artists gaining traction include prominent names from post-independence Bombay Progressive Artists' Group and modernist movements of 20th century,"" says the study.

"From AI weddings to massages, art that puts you in the picture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-ai-weddings-to-massages-art-that-puts-you-in-the-picture/articleshow/116549116.cms,"Remember that not-so-iconic song by Himesh Reshammiya which went 'No touching, only seeing. Understand?' That kind of sums up the attitude of most museums and galleries. An attendant swoops in the minute it looks like you might lay your grubby little paws on their shiny masterpieces. But at the art exhibition curated by the talented duo of Thukral & Tagra (T&T) for Goa's Serendipity Festival, not only are there no paintings, the audience is encouraged to get touchy-feely.You can have a massage, or a haircut, do a sculpting workshop in a dark room with renowned sculptor L N Tallur, walk on a canvas to create your own indigo painting, or find an AI spouse of your dreams. The last one got your attention, right? Artist Shailesh BR, who trained as a priest, has built an AI machine that poses a set of questions to find out if you're the right match. ""Three people have been 'married' till now, and the last one had a big smile on her face,"" says Shailesh, who calls himself a mechanic on Instagram. Asked why, he points to the other device he has created - one that throws red rice at you as a bridal blessing. He also built a prayer machine earlier. ""It's not just about having fun. I wanted the audience to examine why they take part in religious rituals without understanding or questioning them,"" he says.But before you get up close with the art at Panaji's beautiful old GMC complex, viewers are urged to deposit their phones in envelopes and set them on silent. The idea, says Sumir Tagra, is not to see the art through your phones but feel it and touch it. Phones deposited, you can perch comfortably on Chainpreet's sofa to watch a satirical video and drawings created by graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee. But, of course, the first question that pops up is who is this Chainpreet whose drawing room (the space looks like one) one has entered. ""She's a mix of the Sardarnis that I have known. Like most of us, she hits the sofa in the evening and falls into a wormhole of doom scrolling. Besides her spineless boyfriend, I have shown some of her pet peeves through my drawings - overly optimized Indians only focused on winning and NRIs with their overdose of nationalism and nostalgia,"" says Banerjee.A few rooms further on is more art you can sit on. Saurabh Dakshini, who runs an architecture and design studio in Delhi, has created twin chairs that set fans in motion when you rock but the breezy efforts of your labour are enjoyed by the person in the other chair. Talking of enjoyment, in a room enticingly called book massages, therapists encourage you to select a passage, listen to it being read aloud on headphones while getting a massage. So, an Arundhati Roy chapter can earn you a 15-minute neck massage. Thukral & Tagra's collaborative project titled Nafrat/Parvah (hate/care) invites you to deposit an object you hate with a note and in exchange you get care services such as a haircut or beard trim. While someone had put in their pack of cigarettes, and another a lip balm, one submission was particularly searing: A belt, hated because it evokes memories of a father's beating.One can almost hear the questions popping up - How is this art? Does this new wave of interactive works constitute the gamification of art? Can we experience art by playing with it? ""This is an experiment in participatory art,"" explains Tagra. ""There are zero paintings but people touching the art is the picture."" They can use it to express themselves too. Mobile balcaos - a traditional Goan porch - were parked in Panaji's markets, parks and even a bus stand so that locals and tourists could pen their thoughts on postcards. The angst about the 'Delhification' of Goa was clearly visible on the postcard wall.As for what is art, the definition seems to be ever-changing. Remember the $6.2m banana artwork that gave everyone indigestion wondering why anyone would pay that price for it? It's now in the collector's stomach! ""It's the artist's intention that makes it art,"" says Tagra, whose curation attempts to close the distance between artwork and audience though he would rather you not try eating any of the art. But you can listen to them. Just a floor above T&T's show are works by curator Veerangana Solanki who encourages artists to explore the links between touch, sound and memory.Not just the art, the food lab too is about conversations. Every evening, it hosted 'Mock Wild' picnics where AI prompts were turned into actual recipes that people could taste or you could board games that introduced you to India's medicinal plants or go on seaweed-collecting incursions along the coast. The focus was always on the tactile, the live and the dynamic. As Sunil Kant Munjal, founding member of the festival and chairman of Hero Enterprise, puts it, ""This festival cannot be explained, it can only be experienced.""","Serendipity Festival in Goa is an exhibition where the audience is encouraged to get touchy-feely.

We are members of the International Organisation of Pension Supervisors but when they prepare a chart of pension fund managers, NPS is not shown with a footnote that it is an outlier.""Mohanty said NPS assets under management stood at Rs 14 lakh crore and could exceed Rs 15 lakh crore by year-end, with participation from eight crore accounts. Despite this, challenges like low public awareness, limited access for the informal workforce, cultural resistance to long-term savings, and low pension penetration remain.M Nagaraju, secretary, financial services, said formation of the association marks steady progress in the sector.

Experts debate ‘forest cover’ definition after release of forest survey report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-debate-forest-cover-definition-after-release-of-forest-survey-report/articleshow/116548075.cms,"DEHRADUN: The release of Forest Survey of India published ‘ India State of Forest Report ’, on Saturday, evoked mixed response from experts. Many continued to debate on why the plantation of trees outside forests was not counted as green cover, considering that it is a place that is “habitat to myriad animals and endless microorganism and invisible lives thriving on that ecosystem”.B K Singh, retd principal of chief conservator of forests and head of forest force, Karnataka, said, “We have added 1445 sq km of forest and tree cover in two years. Of this, the increase in forest cover is only 156 sq km, and more interesting is that it is only 7 sq km in recorded forests. Forest and tree cover areas put together are 8,27,357 sq km, where the forest cover is a sizable chunk of 7,15,343 sq km. The increase is quite meagre, as compared to the size. Forest departments have been planting in recorded forests at the rate of 100 sq km annually. Why do these plantations not show an increase in cover?”He further said that around 7 sq km has been lost in mangroves. “Again, coastal states are planting mangroves, and the report shows a loss in mangroves. Deforestation is continuing all over, and the report has attempted to cover that,” he added.Environmentalists said that the forest department’s efforts should be assessed and discussed in the biennial report rather than public areas and plantations. Veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra said, “For quite some time, the ministry has been recording the trees outside of the forest department and the forests in its estimates of the forest cover. It appears from a quick glance of the report that much of the increase has taken place in trees outside of the designated forest area and therefore, it would be incorrect to pat the ministry on its back. For all we know, this may be people’s efforts on tree planting. In fact, if we look at Uttarakhand, there are so many landslides that are taking place that we should be losing forest cover under the forest department. The new plantations ought not to be counted as forest cover until the plants have matured.”(Inputs from Pankul Sharma)","The release of Forest Survey of India published ‘ India State of Forest Report ’, on Saturday, evoked mixed response from experts.

‘Inhuman’: CM A Revanth Reddy slams Allu Arjun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inhuman-cm-a-revanth-reddy-slams-allu-arjun/articleshow/116547909.cms,"HYDERABAD: Accusing actor Allu Arjun and the production team of being ""inhuman"" towards Revathi's family and her son Sri Tej, who is battling for his life in a hospital after the Sandhya theatre stampede , chief minister A Revanth Reddy Saturday questioned whether any special laws exist for film stars, superstars, and political figures that exempt them from prosecution.Launching a blistering attack on the actor in the assembly, the CM stressed that as long as he is in office, his primary responsibility is to protect the lives of people, and govt would not spare anyone involved, directly or indirectly, in the Sandhya theatre incident. The stampede claimed the life of Revathi, while her son Sri Tej remains in critical condition.Revanth also condemned the behaviour of film personalities who queued up at Allu Arjun's residence after he was released from jail, as if he had been injured in the incident, claiming to have fractured his legs, arms, or lost a kidney. In contrast, these same people did not visit Revathi's grieving family or offer support to the nine-year-old Sri Tej, who remains in a coma, the CM said.""Some people are criticizing the govt and me over the arrest of the film star in connection with the stampede. But, is there a special law in our Constitution for film and political stars that exempts them from prosecution, or allows them to avoid being booked for a crime - even if they are responsible for someone's death?"" the CM said.""As per Ambedkar's law, there are no separate laws for anyone - whether for Revanth Reddy's family or anyone else. All are equal, and those involved in the Sandhya incident will be dealt with according to the law,"" the CM stated.He also responded to criticisms regarding the delay in Allu Arjun's release after receiving bail, saying: ""There are rules for jail authorities, and they cannot release an accused person at midnight just because he is a film hero. This is not my house where I can act on whims. We follow the law, not personal preferences.""The CM advised the film fraternity to focus on producing films, running their businesses, earning incentives, and making money - but to do so with consideration for society.He pointed out that the state govt had approved benefit shows and allowed a raise in ticket prices for the first week of the film's release. He further highlighted the tragic reality faced by Revathi's family, with Revathi's husband earning only Rs 30,000 a month, yet spending Rs 12,000 on tickets to watch the film, as their son was an ardent fan of Allu Arjun.The CM also responded to claims that the film star's arrest was politically motivated, due to his association with a politician, who was a minister for 10 years. ""This govt will go by the law and the rules, regardless of any political connections,"" he asserted.Explaining the sequence of events on Dec 4, the CM said Sandhya theatre management had approached Chikkadpally police for permission to hold the premiere of Pushpa 2 with Allu Arjun and the film crew in attendance. However, police denied the request in writing, citing concerns over crowd control due to the presence of multiple theatres in the RTC crossroads area, the CM said.""Despite the police denial, Allu Arjun and the production team went ahead with the event, leading to thousands of fans gathering outside the theatre. The situation turned chaotic when bouncers pushed people aside to make way for Allu Arjun. In the chaos, Revathi and her son were among those who fell unconscious. Even at that moment, Revathi did not let go of her son's hand,"" Revanth said.The theatre management initially prevented the assistant commissioner of police from entering to inform Allu Arjun that he needed to leave due to the crowd. The ACP requested the actor to leave, but Allu Arjun insisted on staying to watch the entire film. Eventually, the deputy commissioner of police warned that Allu Arjun would be arrested if he did not leave the premises. The CM said even when cops went to the actor's house before his arrest, Allu Arjun displayed disrespect towards police.The CM outlined two violations committed by Allu Arjun and the production team: The first violation was the actor attending the event despite police denying permission, and the second was his participation in a rally, waving to the crowd from the sunroof of his car. ""These actions not only flouted the law but directly contributed to the tragic events that followed,"" he said.","Chief minister A Revanth Reddy questions whether any special laws exist for film stars, superstars, and political figures that exempt them from prosecution.

Cabinet panel nod to extension of officials recruited laterally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-panel-nod-to-extension-of-officials-recruited-laterally/articleshow/116416861.cms,"NEW DELHI: Four months after UPSC, on the request of ministry of personnel, cancelled its advertisement for lateral entry to 45 govt posts, the appointment committee of the Cabinet has approved a 1-2 year extension in the three-year tenure of 17 laterally-recruited officers currently on deputation or contract.The officers concerned -- at the level of joint secretary, director or deputy secretary -- will be required to sign a fresh contract of lateral recruitment, for the period of their extended appointment. The terms and conditions will remain the same as for their initial appointment for three years.The UPSC advertisement dated 17.08.2024 for lateral recruitments was cancelled barely three days after it was issued, following questions over the lack of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes (OBCs) in these jobs. “Reservation of SC, ST, and OBC classes is being openly snatched away by recruiting through lateral entry on important posts in various ministries of the central government,” Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi had then alleged in a post on X.UPSC on August 20 rescinded the advertisement for 45 lateral-entry posts, hours after minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh wrote to its chairman, saying that the aspect of reservation in lateral recruitment ""needs to be reviewed and reformed in the context of the Hon'ble Prime Minister's focus on ensuring social justice"".Pending the promised reform, however, DoPT in an order issued on Tuesday, put out a list of 17 lateral-entry officers whose three-year term, expiring either later this year on in early 2025, will stand extended to late 2026 end or early 2027.The 17 beneficiary officers, serving across a dozen govt departments/ministries, include three joint secretaries, 12 director-level officers and two deputy secretaries.In his letter requesting UPSC to cancel the advertisement on 45 lateral entry posts in August, junior minister for personnel Jitendra Singh had underlined that the lateral entry principle was endorsed by the administrative reforms commission and also recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission. He also reminded the Congress that it had been taking in lateral entrants when it was in office, though mostly on ad-hoc basis and without following the process of reservations.Singh said PM Modi firmly believes that the lateral entry process must be aligned with the principles of social justice and equity. ""It is important that the constitutional mandate towards social justice is upheld so that deserving candidates from marginalised communities get their rightful representation in the govt services,"" he had underlined.Over 60 senior posts in Govt of India have been filled by the Modi govt through lateral appointments so far.","The appointment committee of the Cabinet has approved a 1-2 year extension in the three-year tenure of 17 laterally-recruited officers.

Supreme Court cuts death to 25-year jail in case of sodomy-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cuts-death-to-25-year-jail-in-case-of-sodomy-murder/articleshow/116416828.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC on Tuesday termed the kidnapping, brutal sodomising and murder of a four-year-old child by a 24-year-old man as ""diabolic"", but commuted his death sentence to 25 years' imprisonment considering his poor background, good conduct in jail, ties with sexagenarian mother who looks after his minor daughter and hoping he is reformable.A temple priest's child in Piludara village in Bharuch district of Gujarat was lured with the offer of an ice-cream on April 13, 2016, by Sambhubhai R Padhiyar, who savagely sodomised the child and then strangled him to death. The trial court convicted him for kidnapping under Section 364 of IPC, sodomy under Section 377 of IPC, murder and various sections of Pocso Act and sentenced him to capital punishment. Gujarat HC confirmed the conviction and sentence.On appeal, the a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Arvind Kumar and K V Viswanathan examined various incriminating evidence and said, ""Without doubt, the crime committed by Padhiyar was diabolic in character. He enticed the innocent child by tempting him with ice-cream and brutally sodomised and murdered the four-year old. He also mercilessly strangulated the child. The postmortem report clearly indicated that death was due to asphyxia by throttling.""Justice Viswanathan then listed the mitigating circumstances - Padhiyar hails from a low socio-economic household; diagnosed with moderate intensity psychotic features and intellectual disability; he had in his early childhood contacted tuberculosis meningitis; maintains family ties with his 64-year-old mother who takes care of his 10 year old daughter; wife has deserted him; his behaviour in jail completely normal and showed good conduct; and feels remorse.Applying principles of what should be just sentence, the bench said, ""We hold that a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission would be 'a just dessert'.""","Sambhubhai R Padhiyar, 24, lured the child with the offer of ice-cream.

The election will take place on Dec 19.There was a tussle over the post between Sena and BJP. Sena's Neelam Gorhe, who is currently deputy chairperson, was said to be in the race. BJP members said the party is keen on bagging the post & didn't want to give it to Sena. BJP's Rahul Narwekar has already been elected as Speaker, unopposed, in the assembly, so if Ram Shinde is elected, both Houses will have a BJP politician in-charge.Council chairperson's post is vacant since July 2022 after the tenure of NCP's Ramraje Nimbalkar ended. Thanking PM Modi, Ram Shinde said, ""I will be filing my nomination papers tomorrow morning at 10 am at Vidhan Bhavan, Nagpur.""Election to the post was not held earlier as Shiv Sena and NCP were split in 2022 and 2023, respectively. BJP has a majority in the council. Sources said BJP has picked Ram Shinde for the job as he is from Dhangar community. He was MLA from Karjat-Jamkhed but was defeated by NCP's (SP) Rohit Pawar in 2019 and 2024.Sena UBT MLC Anil Parab Tuesday asked if MLCs against whom disqualification petitions are pending and a case is pending in SC can still be eligible for becoming chairperson.

PRAYAGRAJ: Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri , the head of Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, lauded chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday for his exemplary leadership, calling him the ‘Sun of Sanatan'.He emphasised that under Yogi's guidance, remarkable standards are being set, advancing the cause of Sanatan Dharma as never before.Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership. He also lauded PM Narendra Modi's vision of making Maha Kumbh a ""Mahayagya of Unity."" He called for collective efforts to make the event clean, healthy, green, digital, and plastic-free.He emphasized the need for participation from every village across the country, alongside local administration, voluntary organisations, and pilgrims, to ensure the success of Maha Kumbh through cleanliness drives and charitable activities.Highlighting the identity Maha Kumbh gained in 2019, he expressed confidence that the 2025 edition would set new benchmarks. He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

The order was passed by Justice Ashutosh Srivastava.Earlier, appearing for Sushil, the counsel for the applicant questioned the authenticity of the suicide note left by Atul Subhash. He also added that the family court judge, before whom the matter of Atul Subhash and his wife Nikita Singhania was pending, was 'spared' despite being named in the suicide note.In response to this, the government's advocate submitted that the high court had on the administrative side taken note of the matter and it had summoned case records.Before the court, the accused limited the relief to a grant of transit anticipatory bail until January 2, the day when the courts in Karnataka will reopen after the winter break. The single judge is likely to pass an order later.On the other hand, the counsel appearing for the complainant argued that there is a specific allegation against the uncle (applicant-accused), as the alleged suicide video says that he was harassing the deceased for extorting money.","The Allahabad high court granted (transit) anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of the widow of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash.

NEW DELHI: Hours after invoking GRAP-III in Delhi-NCR as the capital’s AQI deteriorated to higher end of ‘very poor’, the Commission for Air Quality Management enforced the highest level of curbs ( GRAP-IV ) in the region soon after air quality had crossed into the ‘severe’ zone at 10pm.Previous implementations of GRAP Stage-I and modified Stage-II continue to remain active.

"Uddhav Thackeray calls on Devendra Fadnavis, seeks Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uddhav-thackeray-calls-on-devendra-fadnavis-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-veer-savarkar/articleshow/116412474.cms,"BJP and Congress should move beyond debates over Nehru and Savarkar, and focus on growth issues, Uddhav Thackeray said.

Congress silent on Uddhav’s demand

NAGPUR: In his bid to reclaim the hardline Hindutva turf after being accused of abandoning the party's core ideology, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday questioned BJP on why the nation's highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna , was still not bestowed on Veer Savarkar . He was talking to reporters in Nagpur after attending the winter session of the legislature on Tuesday.""When Devendra Fadnavis was CM, he had written to PM Modi with a request to bestow the honour on Savarkar. Even today he's the CM and his demand has not been considered. Then BJP has no right to speak on Savarkar. I reiterate my demand that the nation's highest honour be given to Savarkar,"" he said.Thackeray also called upon BJP and Congress to move beyond historical debates surrounding Jawaharlal Nehru and Vinayak Savarkar and urged them to focus on critical development issues plaguing the nation. ""Both Nehru and Savarkar are historical figures who made their contributions. Today, what we need is a focus on development, addressing farmers' issues, improving infrastructure, and resolving unemployment,"" he said.Uddhav also met and congratulated CM Devendra Fadnavis in the latter's office at the legislature premises in Nagpur. Sena (UBT)'s Aaditya Thackeray, Anil Parab, Varun Sardesai and Ambadas Danve also congratulated Fadnavis on the poll win. Later, Uddhav and Fadnavis had a closed-door meeting which lasted around 10-15 minutes, Sena (UBT) functionaries said. Uddhav also met speaker Rahul Narwekar. After the meetings, there was speculation that the leader of opposition's post could be given to Sena (UBT), which is the single largest opposition party with 20 MLAs. This was Uddhav's first meeting with Fadnavis after the assembly polls which saw a bitter war of words between the two.Uddhav said, ""I have the expectation of a cultured political atmosphere in Maharashtra. We could not win the polls, they won the polls and have formed the govt. Naturally, we expect this govt to work in the interest of the state and take decisions for the benefit of the state. The rest of the questions on the results are there in the minds of people. We will keep raising our voice about that.""Aaditya said, ""We met CM Fadnavis. We want to have cultured politics and work in the interest of the state for the next five years. So we congratulated them. We have political differences, but there is no personal enmity.""Uddhav Thackeray’s demand for Bharat Ratna for Savarkar was met with silence from Congress on Tuesday. Till late evening, Congress had not reacted to the politically sensitive faultline among the allies. Thackeray’s demand came barely days after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha criticised Savarkar for his views on the Constitution, and for having apologised to the British.","Congress silent on Uddhav’s demand for Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar.

"Oman stops eggs import, hits Tamil Nadu poultry industry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oman-stops-eggs-import-hits-tamil-nadu-poultry-industry/articleshow/116411729.cms,"A large shipment of Indian eggs, worth at least Rs 15 crore, is currently stranded due to the restrictions, said PV Senthil, an egg exporter from Namakkal.

NAMAKKAL: Oman on Tuesday stopped issuing new import permits for Indian table eggs , hitting the poultry industry in Namakkal in Tamil Nadu. The new restriction assumes significance in the wake of Qatar imposing weight restrictions on Indian eggs recently.KRN Rajeshkumar , DMK MP, raised the issue in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. He urged the Centre to discuss with Oman and Qatar officials to resume egg imports from India. ""I have requested meetings with the ambassadors of Oman and Qatar in India to discuss the challenges faced by poultry farmers and egg exporters,"" he told TOI.PV Senthil, an egg exporter from Namakkal and general secretary of Livestock and Agri-Farmers Trade Association (LIFT), said a large shipment of Indian eggs, worth at least Rs 15 crore, is currently stranded due to these restrictions. Importers in Oman are struggling to clear the Indian egg containers at Sohar port in Oman, and those still in transit.According to exporters in Namakkal, the egg export business has significantly declined due to the actions of Oman and Qatar, the two key importing nations.Namakkal egg exporters have been facing tough times since June when Oman stopped giving import permits for Indian table eggs. After several meetings at the consulate level, Oman resumed imports in Sept, but only with limited permits. On Tuesday, Oman again decided to stop issuing new import permits for Indian eggs.Data from National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) indicates that 11.4 crore eggs were exported to various countries, including Oman, Qatar, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Muscat, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka at the start of the year, with Oman accounting for 50% of those exports. However, this number plummeted to just 2.6 crore by June.An NECC official noted that the figure has fallen under a crore since June.","DMK MP KRN Rajeshkumar raised the issue in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday informed Lok Sabha that ED has so far restituted Rs 22,280 crore worth of assets to victims of various scams, including return of over Rs 14,000 crore to various banks from the sale of assets of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya , and Rs 1,053 crore of diamond merchant Nirav Modi.ED and the banks have together moved a special court in Mumbai for the sale of assets of another diamantaire, Mehul Choksi, who along with Nirav Modi had laundered over Rs 13,000 crore of Punjab National Bank funds and fled the country.The special court has allowed ED to carry out valuation and auction of the attached and seized properties worth Rs 2,566 crore and deposit the sale proceeds in the fixed deposit accounts of PNB and other liquidators.Replying to the supplementary demands for grants, Sitharaman said: ""ED has made significant progress in restoring assets to the legitimate owners of properties under the legal framework of PMLA, which stipulates that assets may be returned to bona fide claimants once trial commences, specifically after charges are framed by the special court.""She said ED was effectively using PMLA sections 8(7) and 8(8), which allow for the restoration of assets to rightful owners when it is determined that the properties were initially acquired through illicit means but ultimately belong to innocent parties.","ED has so far restituted Rs 22,280 crore worth of assets to victims of various scams.

NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Tuesday took a big step forward to implement its dream of ""one nation, one election"" by successfully introducing two bills that lay down the mechanism to hold simultaneous elections in the country.The Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha by law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal after a nearly 90-minute heated debate with the opposition terming the move ""anti-constitutional.""The bills were introduced after division of votes - 269 members in favour and 198 against - numbers that were good enough to get the bills introduced in Lok Sabha but not enough to get them passed, which requires two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.Congress member Manickam Tagore was quick to point out that the government did not have a two-thirds majority among the 461 members who took part in the voting today. In Lok Sabha, 269 members voted in favour of the bill against the two-thirds-mark of 307.Another Congress member Shashi Tharoor said the voting at the introduction stage of two bills on simultaneous elections in the Lok Sabha showed the BJP did not have the two-third majority required to pass a constitutional amendment.""We (the Congress) are not the only ones that have opposed this bill. The vast majority of the opposition parties have opposed this bill and the grounds are very many, it is a violation of the federal structure of the Constitution. Why should a state government fall if the central government falls?"" he told reporters in Parliament premises.The National Democratic Alliance - which includes the BJP and its allies have 293 MPs in its camp. The Congress-led INDIA bloc has 234. If all the members in Lok Sabha are present and voting, a constitutional amendment bill will need 362 votes to succeed.Not just the Congress, but several other parties including the DMK, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, NCP-SP, Shiv Sena-UBT, AIMIM among others opposed the bills calling it an assault on the basic structure of the Constitution.YSRCP, which has four members in Lok Sabha, is the only non-NDA party to have declared support for the bill. BJD, another fence sitter, is yet to spell out its stand. BJD failed to open its account in Lok Sabha in elections this year, but has seven members in Rajya Sabha.Little wonder, the government made it clear at the outset that it will refer the bills to Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider consultations.Home minister Amit Shah told Lok Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said during a meeting of the Union Cabinet that the bill should be referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider deliberations at every level.Shah said the proposed bills did not attack the ""basic structure doctrine of the Constitution, as claimed by the opposition"".BJP allies TDP and Shiv Sena declared ""unwavering support"" for the legislation. But the government will need a lot more support and the BJP floor managers face a difficult road ahead if they want the bills to be passed.The only way perhaps they can reach the magical number of two-thirds majority is by weaning away some parties from the INDIA blocWith nearly 20 BJP MPs not present for the voting today, the party is likely to issue notices to MPs who were absent during the division of votes, according to sources. The BJP had issued a three-line whip for the presence of its MPs stating that some important legislative agenda is on the agenda.","The bills were introduced after division of votes - 269 members in favour and 198 against.

NEW DELHI: A five-judge Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday ticked off Allahabad high court's Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav for his controversial speech at a VHP event and counselled him to maintain dignity of the constitutional post he holds and exercise caution while delivering public speeches.The collegium, also comprising four other senior judges - Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, Hrishikesh Roy and A S Oka - had on Dec 10 taken note of newspaper reports of Justice Yadav's Dec 8 speech and sought ""details and particulars"" of the speech from the HC for examining the issue, which created a stir among activist lawyers and politicians.Pursuant to the summons, Justice Yadav appeared before the five-judge collegium in Supreme Court on Tuesday and offered to explain the purport, meaning and context of his speech while maintaining that the media selectively quoted from his speech to create an unnecessary controversy.The collegium, however, was unconvinced with his explanations and ticked him off for the casual manner in which he made certain statements in the speech. The CJI-led collegium told him that conduct, demeanour and speech of a HC or SC judge, being a constitutional post holder, is constantly under scrutiny & hence expected to maintain dignity of the high office.Moreover, the senior-most judges of the apex court told Justice Yadav that every statement made by a high court judge or a Supreme Court judge, either in the courtroom or outside at a public event, must not only be in sync with the dignity of the office but also not cause damage to the people's faith in judiciary.Justice Yadav, appointed an additional judge on Dec 12, 2019 of Allahabad HC and made permanent on March 26, 2021, is scheduled to retire on April 15, 2026. His speech at a VHP event on Dec 8 had reportedly supported UCC and allegedly made remarks targeting the Muslim community.While SC, through numerous judgments over the last four decades, has repeatedly underlined the need to bring about Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Justice Yadav's comments against the Muslim community riled several lawyers and politicians.Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan-led NGO 'Committee for Judicial Accountability and Reforms' demanded the apex court to conduct an in-house inquiry against the judge. Fifty-five MPs from the opposition parties have already served a notice in the Rajya Sabha for initiation of removal motion against Justice Yadav.",Allahabad high court's Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav was ticked off for his controversial speech at a VHP event.

NEW DELHI: National Test Agency will conduct only competitive entrance tests for admission into educational institutions from next year and won’t hold any recruitment exams, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Tuesday. He also said that education and health ministries are deliberating on whether to conduct the medical entrance exam NEET-UG in pen-and-paper mode or online mode.“We are in talks with the health ministry whether NEET should be conducted in pen-and-paper mode or online. Whatever option will be considered best suited for conducting the exam, NTA is ready to undertake the exercise being a ‘service provider’ and our aim is to ensure zero-error,” Pradhan said. The detailed modalities for NEET-UG is likely to be announced in 2-3 weeks.The minister clarified that CUET-UG will continue to be held once a year. While sharing recommendations of committee headed by former ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan for the “smooth and fair” conduct of exams and strengthening of NTA, Pradhan said NTA will adopt recommendations “in letter and spirit” whether it’s about ensuring “secured storage” of question papers and utilising govt educational institutions & infrastructure where sanctity can be ensured while conducting exams.“NTA will be limited to conducting only entrance exams for higher education and not conduct any recruitment exams from next year,” he said, adding the idea is to conduct “error-free exams” and fix “accountability”.Mentioning the details of the panel’s recommendations and govt’s action, Pradhan also said that the NTA will be restructured next year and new posts are being created, and has also decided, the Radhakrishnan-led panel, whose report was made public on Tuesday, has observed that the NTA had “outstretched” itself to accommodate diverse requests from test indenting agencies for handling end-to-end operations of tests.“The NTA should primarily conduct entrance examinations. Enhancing its scope for other examinations may be considered after the capacity of the NTA is augmented,” the panel had recommended. The panel was set up after the NEET-UG exam paper leak in June.Pradhan said the NTA will set up a robust Grievance Reporting and Redressal Cell to address concerns of students. He added that steps will be taken to address the Supreme Court’s concern on student wellness and exam de-stressing.",National Test Agency will conduct only competitive entrance tests for admission into educational institutions from next year.

NEW DELHI: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to send notices to around 20 members of parliament (MPs), who were absent during voting on the bill meant for the ""one nation, one election"" in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, reported a news agency ANI citing sources.The MPs from the BJP were absent in the Lower House in defiance of the whip that the party had issued days ahead of the proceeding which was supposed to vote on the simultaneous polls bills, officially named the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024 and Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024.Union law minister Arjun Meghwal on Tuesday introduced two bills aimed at conducting simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, as part of the 'one nation, one election' initiative, which sparked strong opposition protests.The bills, however, failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in the lower house, receiving 269 votes in favour and 198 against.The opposition parties criticised the bills as an attack on federalism , while the government asserted that the bill was in line with the Constitution. ""ONOE bills in line with Constitution, do not assault basic structure doctrine. Objections to ONOE bills political in nature,"" stated the law minister.The opposition demanded immediate withdrawal of the bills, labelling them as an assault on the Constitution and an attempt to 'kill democracy and bring authoritarianism and dictatorship.'Meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah revealed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested sending the bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for thorough examination. ""When the One Nation, One Election Bill was taken up in the cabinet for approval, PM Modi had said that it should be sent to the JPC for detailed discussion. If the law minister is willing to send the bill to JPC, the discussion on its introduction can end,"" Shah said.","BJP likely to send notices to around 20 members of parliament who were absent during voting on the bill meant for the ""one nation, one election"" in Lok Sabha.

Govt introduces ONOE bills in Lok Sabha; opposition says numbers won't add up to pass them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-introduces-onoe-bills-in-lok-sabha-opposition-says-numbers-wont-add-up-to-pass-them/articleshow/116413042.cms,"Lok Sabha MPs give voice vote on the ‘one nation, one election’ bill during the winter session of Parliament in New Delhi on Tuesday.

ONOE bills assault statute's basic structure, says Congress

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday introduced two bills in Lok Sabha - the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Amendment Bill, 2024 - to change laws for holding simultaneous elections of Lok Sabha and state assemblies along with UTs amid massive uproar from the opposition parties , underlining the challenge Modi govt would face to synchronise polls.In the 90-minute debate, the opposition claimed the 'one nation, one election' (ONOE) plan was against the spirit of federalism and exceeded the legislative competence of Parliament and was part of a conspiracy to bring in dictatorship by stealth. Govt defended the effort saying it is 41 years since Election Commission recommended clubbing of polls and said the two bills would be referred to a joint committee of Parliament for scrutiny.A vote on whether the bill should be introduced saw the ruling side prevailing with a 263-198 score despite the glaring absence of 20 members, including ministers, from BJP . The opposition pointed out that govt did not have the two-thirds majority required for LS to clear the bill.But the margin paled before the ask of the support of 362 - two -third of the 543-strong House laid down for the passage of a constitutional amendment bill. Although successive govts have managed to rustle up numbers in excess of their actual squad, the gap between the actual and the desirable is too big and would require extraordinary effort.BJP does not have adequate numbers to meet the two-third threshold in Rajya Sabha either - 121 against the 167 needed in the House with a total strength, inclusive of the 12 nominated members, of 250.This was pointed out by Congress's Shashi Tharoor to predict that the bill was destined to be defeated. ""Undoubtedly, govt has larger numbers on its side... but to pass it (bills to amend the Constitution), you need a two-thirds majority that they very clearly don't have,"" he said. Significantly, govt on its own referred the bills, introduced by law minister Arjun Meghwal, to a joint parliamentary panel for detailed scrutiny. Home minister Amit Shah said PM Modi had favoured referring the bills to a joint committee of Parliament for wider deliberations at every level. ""Detailed discussions can take place in the JPC. The report of the JPC will be approved by the Cabinet and Parliament will get to discuss the bills,"" Shah said, urging the agitated opposition MPs to calm down. ""When this bill was being discussed in the Cabinet, the PM himself suggested referring it to a JPC,"" he said. Meghwal said: ""There have been multiple discussions on the issue. On June 19, 2019, a meeting was held by the Prime Minister on holding simultaneous elections in which 19 political parties participated. Of them, 16 supported the move while three others opposed it.""""One of the essential features is federalism and the structure of our democracy. The bills assault the basic structure of the Constitution and exceed the legislative competence of this House,"" Congress MP Manish Tewari said and demanded that the bills be withdrawn.Samajwadi Party MP Dharmendra Yadav said the measure was an attempt to bring dictatorship in the country. ""Two days ago, govt was swearing by the principles of the Constitution. Now, they want to finish the federal structure which is a core principle of the Constitution,"" Yadav said.TMC's Kalyan Banerjee said the move wasn't aimed at election reform but to fulfil the desires of a single person. DMK's T R Baalu and Anil Desai from Shiv Sena (UBT) also opposed the govt decision to introduce the two bills. NCP (SP)'s Supriya Sule favoured referring the bills to a parliamentary committee, if they could not be withdrawn. ""This bill is aimed at maximising political gain and convenience. This bill will finish off regional parties,""AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi said.BJP allies TDP and Shiv Sena, extended ""unwavering support"" to the election reform measure.Congress's Priyanka Gandhi Vadra rejected the bill as ""anti-constitutional"".

'I brought it home thinking it was a ball' - Children of the Bombs - BBC World Service Documentaries

LONDON: Children maimed by crude bombs used by political activists during election campaigns in West Bengal have appeared in a BBC documentary, “Children of the Bombs”, broadcast on Tuesday which reveals that at least 565 children have been killed, maimed or injured by such bombs in West Bengal since 1996 when Bengali musician Kabir Suman wrote “Howzzat”.That song was inspired by a blast in a park in Kolkata in 1996 in which Puchi was injured aged nine. He recalls how he and four friends were playing cricket and found some balls in a bag which they thought were cricket balls. “When I hit that ball with my bat, immediately there was a blast,” he said.The parents describe finding their kids, one with no eyes, covered in blood. Two of them died. The father of Gopal who died, Bablu Biswas, said he only identified his son by his flower-shaped trouser button.Avijit Mondal, Puchu’s friend, told the BBC Eye documentary: “Election means fear and riots. Why does this always affect people from the slums? Someone’s life gets wasted for just a few votes.”“Extreme abuse of childhood and adolescence is going on. If I was the chief minister of the state, I would put an end to this. Forever. I would be merciless and ruthless against the mob,” said Pankaj Dutta, former IGP,West Bengal,who died on Nov 30, after giving the interview.Poulami appears in the BBC World Service documentary. She lost her hand aged seven in 2018 when she picked up an object which she thought was a ball and it exploded, blowing her fingers off.Dutta tells the documentary the use of bombs became an accepted feature of politics in West Bengal after the 1946 Calcutta Riots but the genesis of bomb-making started in Muraripukur Garden House in Kolkata in 1908 when revolutionaries Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill British magistrate Douglas Kingsford.","At least 565 children have been killed, maimed or injured by such bombs in West Bengal since 1996.

NHAI invites bids for barrier-less tolling at Gharonda plaza on Delhi-Chandigarh NH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-invites-bids-for-barrier-less-tolling-at-gharonda-plaza-on-delhi-chandigarh-nh/articleshow/116416730.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for barrier-less tolling at the Gharonda plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway in the National Capital Region. This is the second such tender that the authority has floated to bring more highway stretches under the “Free Flow Tolling” system.Under this system, there will be no physical toll plaza or barrier, thereby eliminating the need for vehicles to slow down to pay user fee. Officials said advanced FASTag readers , which can read the smart tags fixed on vehicles moving at even 100 kmph, and high-power cameras to read the registration number will be fixed on overhead gantries across lanes for deducting toll amount automatically.Earlier, the NHAI had floated a tender for a similar system at the Delhi-Gurgaon border for the newly built Dwarka Expressway , and the process to select a player is underway. This system will eliminate the need for vehicles to slow down to pay toll.As per the bid document, banks and financial institutions can submit their bids. The bank that offers maximum revenue share will get the tolling rights. There will be no need for a separate toll collector or operator.Officials said the highways authority has invited bids only for one toll plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh highways, as this is the only public funded one, which means toll collected at Gharonda plaza goes to the NHAI. “So, even if there is any loss of toll revenue during the few months because of non-compliant commuters, the NHAI will bear it. If we go for this barrier-less tolling at plazas that are under private players, they may raise claims of revenue loss.

NASHIK: Disgruntled NCP MLA Chhagan Bhujbal on Tuesday said Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis , and two top NCP functionaries, Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare, ""tried their best"" to convince party president Ajit Pawar to give him a ministerial berth.""All three (Fadnavis, Patel and Tatkare) wanted me as a minister in the new govt. They made all efforts to convince Ajit dada. On the day of the swearing-in ceremony too, Fadnavis tried to convince him to have me in his cabinet. I don't know why Ajit dada felt I should not be included. It is for him to explain,"" Bhujbal told TOI.He further added that party presidents should run a party in a 'democratic manner' rather than conducting a 'one-man' show.The Yeola MLA said, ""It is not healthy for any party to not listen to other senior members. I am angry not because I was denied a ministerial berth but because of how decisions were made about NCP MLAs who would be ministers. It was not a collective decision. I cannot be taken for granted.""Bhujbal returned to Nashik on Monday night, skipping the assembly session in Nagpur. He also did not attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new ministers in Nagpur on Sunday.""It is ironic that my party bosses now want me to go to Rajya Sabha. In June this year, I sought a Rajya Sabha nomination as I had been an MLA for years. They then told me that the party needed me in the state assembly. They picked Ajit dada's wife (Sunetra Pawar) for the Upper House,"" Bhujbal said.He also met loyalists in Nashik and later in his constituency on Tuesday.""Party workers have advised me not to accept the RS offer as it will send a wrong message to voters in Yeola. I have decided to follow their advice. Despite the Maratha quota issue, voters, including those from the Maratha community, elected me. I could not ignore their sentiments and have rejected the offer,"" Bhujbal said, adding that he will not resign as MLA since it would be against the mandate.On whether he would quit NCP and join another party, Bhujbal said, ""I will not say anything at this juncture. I am meeting the members of All-India Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad and people from the OBC community on Wednesday. I will hear their suggestions and then decide.""","Yeola MLA Chhagan Bhujbal says Devendra Fadnavis, Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare ""tried their best"" to convince party president Ajit Pawar to give him a ministerial berth.

Currently, the scheme is meant for only landholder farmers irrespective of the size of their landholdings.It also recommended that a National Commission for Minimum Living Wages for farm labourers be established at the earliest to provide them their long due rights.Observing that the implementation of MSP remains a focal point in the dialogue surrounding agricultural reform and farmers welfare , the report said, ""Since the Committee believe that implementing a robust and legally binding MSP in the country could play a crucial role in reducing farmer suicides in India by providing financial stability, protecting against market volatility and alleviating debt burdens, they recommended implementation of the same.""The committee also urged the govt to enhance allocation to agriculture especially to improve productivity. It noted that though the data showed that the department of agriculture and farmers welfare got higher allocations in absolute amount from 2021-22 to 2024-25, its percentage share in the total central plan outlay witnessed decline from 3.53% in 2020-21 to 2.54% in 2024-25.Besides making these recommendations, the panel urged govt to explore possibility of providing compulsory Universal Crop Insurance to small farmers with land holding of up to two hectares on the lines of the central govt's health insurance scheme, being provided to all citizens.",A parliamentary panel on Tuesday recommended legal guarantee to procurement of crops at minimum support price (MSP) The panel also suggested introduction of a scheme to waive debt of farmers and farm labourers.

""A scam that not just led to a colossal loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer, but also gave government-corporate collaboration its worst name, a.k.a crony capitalism,"" he said on X. The telecom minister said spectrum in the UPA era was allocated via the opaque FCFS (first come, first served) policy, resulting in scams and losses.""The Modi government prioritises transparency and public interest - mobile telephony spectrum is now auctioned,"" Scindia said.Scindia was responding to Ramesh's post on X that linked the process of in-principle approval by govt to that of administrative spectrum allocation process during the previous UPA govt. Ramesh said the NDA govt has stated on record that ""spectrum assigned administratively are also chargeable and hence contribute to revenue"", a position he says is contrary to what the PM has been proclaiming for many years. ""Recall that the BJP reaped huge political dividends from the media frenzy generated by its proxies in the government over the UPA's allocation of 2G spectrum by administrative processes rather than auctions. Fraudulent revenue loss projections and an overactive judiciary ended up doing huge damage to the investment environment in telecoms,"" he said.Ramesh said at the end of an exhaustive trial, the CBI court acquitted all the accused, stating in strongest terms the entire affair was built on ""public perception created by rumour, gossip and speculation"".

Govt claims synchronised poll plan has widespread public & political support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-claims-synchronised-poll-plan-has-widespread-public-political-support/articleshow/116415569.cms,"Despite e-voting option, a few take ballot route

NEW DELHI: Ahead of govt tabling the 'one nation, one election' bills in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the law ministry said the idea of simultaneous polls proposed aligning the election cycles of Lok Sabha and state assemblies, but voting could continue to be held in multiple phases, not necessarily on the same day across the country.""Voters to cast their ballots for both tiers of govt (Parliament and assemblies) on the same day in their constituencies, though voting could still occur in phases across the country,"" the ministry said in an explainer.For the first 15 years, from 1951-52 to 1967, simultaneous elections were held for Lok Sabha and assemblies, it said and added that this cycle of synchronised elections was disrupted in 1968 and 1969 due to the premature dissolution of some state assemblies. Some states such as Tripura and Nagaland that were formed later were not aligned with the Lok Sabha polls.The first to be dissolved under Article 356 was the Left govt in Kerala in 1959. Non-Congress govts in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Bihar were similarly dissolved, and President's Rule imposed in 1968.BJP has accused Congress of misusing Article 356 at least 50 times to dissolve elected govts in states.""The fourth Lok Sabha was also dissolved prematurely in 1970, with fresh elections held in 1971. Unlike the first, second, and third Lok Sabhas, which completed their full five-year terms, the fifth Lok Sabha's term was extended until 1977 under Article 352 because of the declaration of the Emergency,"" it said.Since then, only a few Lok Sabha terms have lasted the full five years, such as the eighth, 10th, 14th and 15th. Others, including the sixth, seventh, ninth, 11th, 12th and 13th, were dissolved early.Thrice, Lok Sabha was dissolved prematurely within one and half years: the ninth Lok Sabha was dissolved within one year and three months on March 13, 1991; again the 11th Lok Sabha was dissolved within one year and six months on Dec 4 1997; the 12th Lok Sabha had the shortest period of one year and a month and was dissolved on April 26, 1999. The next Lok Sabha was also dissolved prematurely on Feb 6, 2004, eight months ahead of schedule.By proposing to align these elections, the high-level committee on simultaneous elections led by former president Ram Nath Kovind has led the groundwork for a transformative shift in India's electoral process, the ministry said.""The proposed phased approach to implementing simultaneous elections, along with constitutional amendments, could pave the way for a more efficient and stable electoral environment in India,"" it said. The govt claims that the proposed simultaneous elections have widespread public and political support as it streamlines the country's democratic processes and bolsters the efficiency of governance.The Kovind panel received over 21,500 responses, with 80% in favour of simultaneous elections. People from most states and UTs supported synchronisation of elections, including those from opposition-governed states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal.Of the 47 political parties which sent their responses, 32 supported simultaneous polls while 15 raised their concerns about potential anti-democratic effects and marginalisation of regional parties.The voting process for introduction of the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Amendment Bill, 2024 wasn’t all smooth sailing. Though the new Lok Sabha has provision for electronic voting, some members insisted on exercising their franchise through ballot paper. Those in favour of the bill had to press the green button on the automatic vote recording system installed on each seat, those against had to press the red button and members wanting to abstain from voting had the choice to press the yellow button. 369 MPs cast votes through the machine and remaining 92 were cast through slips. However, due to the confusion, voting had to be carried out twice and even then, some of the MPs chose to opt for voting through the ballot papers. Total 269 members voted in favour of the Bills while 198 others opposed it and, thus, the bills were accepted for introduction in the lower House.","Voters to cast their ballots for both tiers of govt (Parliament and assemblies) on the same day in their constituencies.

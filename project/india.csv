"Vande Bharats to run on bullet train corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains , with a maximum design speed of 280 kpmh, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains, which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even when the Vande Bharat trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the Vande Bharat trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, and would meet the expectation of passengers.","The railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains to run on this section.

"Centre targets high procurement of pulses through PSS, PSF schemes to reassure farmers, boost output",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-targets-high-procurement-of-pulses-through-pss-psf-schemes-to-reassure-farmers-boost-output/articleshow/117440906.cms,"File photo

Govt extends free import of tur till March 2026

NEW DELHI: The Centre is aiming to aggressively procure tur, urad and lentil from farmers through price support scheme (PSS) and price stabilisation fund (PSF) to give an assurance to the growers that their produce will be bought by govt. Two govt cooperatives — Nafed and NCCF — have been directed to start purchase of pulses aggressively to encourage farmers to boost output.Sources said the directions were issued to the two cooperatives at a high level inter-ministerial meeting attended by officials from agriculture and consumer affairs departments and other stakeholders. Both the agencies have pre-registered around 21 lakh farmers for procuring their produce in key pulses producing states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh prior to sowing season.While the fund allocated under PSS is meant for use to support farmers when market prices crash below the MSP, the PSF is used for stabilising the prices of agricultural commodities and protecting consumers.The direction comes amid the govt’s commitment to buy 100% of urad, arhar and masur (lentil) varieties of pulses, which the country imports in substantial quantities, and prevent distress sale by farmers. “Now we are buying pulses not just at MSP but also at a price close to the rates at mandis. Unless we assure farmers that they will get remunerative price, they won’t grow pulses. This move will boost the country's pulses production to become self-sufficient,” said a source.Under the dynamic minimum assured procurement price (MAPP), the agriculture ministry has approved that agencies can buy tur and urad based on last three day average mandi prices .In the last two years the govt agencies could not purchase these three varieties of pulses as mandis prices were ruling above the MSP because of decline in production and rise in demand. The arrival of tur at mandis is likely to increase by this month end. The govt will have to purchase pulses at MSP using the PSS since the prospects of robust crop has started impacting the mandi prices of tur below MSP of Rs 7,550 per quintal.The govt on Monday extended the free import for tur dal till March 31 next year to keep prices under check. The Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued the notification. The govt had allowed the import of tur under the “free category' from May 15, 2021. Subsequently, the free regime has been extended from time to time. The existing free import policy was first introduced in May 2021 and has been extended several times amid faltering domestic production.",Two govt cooperatives — Nafed and NCCF — have been directed to start purchase of pulses aggressively.

DRDO tests key tech for next-gen hypersonic missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drdo-tests-key-tech-for-next-gen-hypersonic-missiles/articleshow/117439896.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a step towards developing next-generation hypersonic missiles , DRDO has conducted the successful test of an active cooled combustor of a scramjet engine on the ground for 120 seconds for the first time in the country.Hypersonic missiles, which fly at speeds greater than Mach 5 or five times the speed of sound, have become a major focus area for major military powers , given their capability to defeat existing missile and air defence systems due to super-fast speeds, high-manoeuvrability and low altitudes of flight.DRDO lab Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL) recently demonstrated the active cooled scramjet combustor on the ground for 120 seconds. “The achievement marks a crucial milestone in the development of next-generation hypersonic missiles,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.A DRDO official said, “Several nations including the US, Russia, China and India are actively pursuing hypersonic technology . The key is scramjets, which are air-breathing engines capable of sustaining combustion at supersonic speeds without using any moving parts.” “The ground test showcased several notable achievements, demonstrating its potential for operational use in hypersonic vehicles, like successful ignition and stable combustion. Ignition in a scramjet engine is like ‘keeping a candle lit in a hurricane’,” he added.The indigenous development of endothermic scramjet fuel , jointly by DRDL and the industry, is central to this breakthrough. The fuel offers dual benefits of significant cooling improvement and ease of ignition.","DRDO has conducted the successful test of an active cooled combustor of a scramjet engine on the ground for 120 seconds for the first time in the country. “The achievement marks a crucial milestone in the development of next-generation hypersonic missiles,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117439886,imgsize-763103,width-400,resizemode-4/117439886.jpg"

KOLKATA: Sanjay Roy responded “I can’t say” to 56 out of 104 questions from prosecution, but said “yes” when asked if he was the person seen in CCTV footage at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital ’s chest department on Aug 9.This key admission played a critical role in linking him to the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor in the hospital’s seminar hall, where she had retired to rest after a 16-hour shift.The Sealdah trial court convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday. In his 172-page judgment, additional sessions judge Anirban Das highlighted Roy’s incriminating admission during the trial.Judge Das pointed out that although Roy denied many questions related to the crime, he did not challenge the “truthfulness” of the CCTV footage. “He was cautioned that the replies may or may not be used for or against him and even after understanding everything he gave the reply by supporting the contents of the footage. So, the version of the accused became relevant in this case,” the judge said.The court examined a specific frame from the CCTV camera located in the chest department on the third-floor. While the crime scene was nearby but outside the camera’s coverage area, footage captured Roy leaving at 4.31am on Aug 9, holding a helmet but without his Bluetooth earphones. Roy admitted to being in the department from 4.03am to 4.31 am, a fact that the judge emphasised as establishing his presence at the crime scene.In his defence, Roy claimed he was at the hospital to visit a fellow civic volunteer undergoing surgery, though he couldn’t provide the patient’s identity. Roy said he left his helmet and earphones in the male ward. However, the judge found this explanation lacking, as Roy could not substantiate his presence in the male ward nor identify the supposed patient.When confronted with evidence that his saliva was found on the victim’s body, Roy argued that it was planted after he was tortured in police custody. Judge Das dismissed this claim, saying the victim had been cremated by the time Roy was taken into custody on Aug 10.The defence’s assertion that Roy’s facial injuries were from boxing practice was also refuted by forensic experts . They said the injuries were scratch marks, not blunt trauma typical of boxing. “This means that the accused and his counsels were swimming in a whirlpool and could not understand what would be appropriate defence. All the defence went against the accused,” the judge said.","The Sealdah trial court convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday.

MUMBAI: Shariful Fakir , arrested for the attack on actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence, told investigators that Khan had locked him in a tight hold from the front. Shariful said that he then stabbed Khan in his back repeatedly to escape.The police will record Khan's statement once he is discharged from Lilavati Hospital , where he is recuperating.A 150-member police team tracked down Shariful, a Bangladeshi national living illegally here, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation on Sunday. Investigators are likely to recreate the sequence of events leading to the crime.""We have to be mindful that the actor and his family are traumatised after everything that they have been through. All precautions will be taken while recreating the sequence of events at the crime scene,"" an officer said.Forensic experts were able to lift 19 fingerprints from the crime scene after the offence occurred on Thursday. The fingerprints were lifted from the bathroom window, pipes and a ladder that the accused had accessed to gain entry to the flat.The prints will now be verified against Shariful's fingerprints to find our if there is a match. ""After the fingerprints were lifted on the day of the offence, they were run through the national database but no match was found. The reason could be that Shariful does not have a prior crime record in the country,"" an officer said.The police have strong reason to believe that Shariful might have had a prior criminal record in Bangladesh. ""He had carried tools used for burglaries such as hammers et cetera, besides the knife. The CCTV footage shows him going up the building without footwear but wearing his shoes on his way downstairs. This indicates he was careful to carry his shoes in his bag on his way up as he had climbed up the pipes,"" an officer said.Back in Bangladesh, Sharif has two brothers. His parents also live there. He is not married and has no relatives here. The police have not found any Indian identification documents on him.""A day after the crime, Shariful saw his CCTV images being flashed on television news. He panicked on realising that the police were on his trail. He went into hiding in Thane with plans to board the Geetanjali Express to Howrah and cross the border to Bangladesh,"" an officer said.Before Shariful could execute his escape, a police team tracked him down.A team of 75 policemen involved in the case were felicitated on Monday by joint police commissioner (law and order) Satyanarayan.","Shariful Fakir, a Bangladeshi national, was arrested for assaulting actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A.

No confirmation of participation of Indians in Russian forces: Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-confirmation-of-participation-of-indians-in-russian-forces-ukraine/articleshow/117438494.cms,"Representative photo

A week after news that an Indian citizen from Kerala, Binil TB, died fighting for Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, told TOI Kyiv had no confirmation of the participation of Indians in Russian forces . Speaking to Indian journalists virtually from Kyiv, Yermak acknowledged that citizens of other nations had been duped into fighting for Russia in the war.“We know about North Koreans. It is public. We know about Cubans. Unfortunately, these people are lied to and then they appeared in Russia. When we have confirmation that some citizens of another country participated on the side of Russia, we have worked very properly, very openly through diplomatic channels and informed the respective country it’s not right. It’s against good relations between countries.”Binil and others like him were either promised jobs in Europe or were put onto employment in Russia’s military support services by middlemen. At a press briefing last week, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there were 126 cases of Indians serving in the Russian army, of which 96 had been discharged and returned to India. However, 12 Indians serving in the Russian forces have died in the ongoing war and the whereabouts of 16 others are not known.Also read:Yermak also sought India’s support in bringing back Ukrainian children forcibly deported by Russia. According to Kyiv, around 20,000 children had been forcibly taken from Russian-occupied territories, separated from their relatives, and pushed into Russia’s vast foster-care and adoption system.“I think it's possible to increase the pressure on Russia and to find new strategies to bring the kids back. The children have to be back without any conditions. President Zelenskyy discussed with Prime Minister Modi this issue, and he said that India is ready to participate, and Indians are ready to be involved in this process to help to bring back Ukrainian children.”","A week after news that an Indian citizen from Kerala, Binil TB, died fighting for Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, told TOI Kyiv had no confirmation of the participation of Indians in Russian forces.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday welcomed the ruling by the World Bank-appointed neutral expert that said differences between India and Pakistan over the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power projects in J&K fall within his competence under the Indus Waters Treaty.Govt sees this as a vindication of its stand and interpretation of the treaty as it does not recognise or participate in the parallel and “illegally constituted” court of arbitration proceedings being carried out at Pakistan’s request.In an official statement on the neutral expert’s decision, govt also said it remains in touch with Pakistan for the modification and review of the IWT. India had last year cited cross-border terrorism as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the treaty.“India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven questions that were referred to the neutral expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the treaty,” govt said.India was upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way to look into Pakistan’s objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue. Govt said it has been India’s “consistent and principled” position that the neutral expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences.“Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,” it said.“Being committed to preserving the sanctity and integrity of the treaty, India will continue to participate in the neutral expert process so that the differences are resolved in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Treaty, which does not provide for parallel proceedings on the same set of issues. For this reason, India does not recognize or participate in the illegally constituted Court of Arbitration proceeding.”",World Bank-appointed neutral expert said differences between India and Pakistan over the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power projects in J&K fall within his competence under the Indus Waters Treaty.

MUMBAI: Bangladeshi national Shariful Fakir, arrested for breaking into actor Saif Ali Khan’s home and stabbing him last Thursday, was driven to crime because of extreme poverty, police said. “He chose Saif’s residence randomly. All he wanted was to steal from someone rich and escape to Bangladesh with the loot to help his ailing mother,” said an officer. “The immediate provocation for the crime was that Shariful lost a housekeeping job at a Thane restaurant on Dec 15 when its contract with the manpower agency owned by Jitendra Pandey ended. He found himself nearly penniless. He said as much.”Before joining the Thane restaurant in Sept last year, Shariful worked at a Worli restaurant, earning Rs 13,000 a month. He told police during interrogation that from this sum, he would send Rs 12,000 to Bangladesh for his mother’s medical treatment, keeping only Rs 1,000 for himself. One day in Aug, the restaurant management caught him stealing and terminated his employment. Having studied only till Class 2, he found another menial job at the Thane restaurant.Shariful entered India by crossing Dawki river on India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paying Rs 10,000 to an agent to have him taken to Assam. “The agent helped him board a bus to Kolkata, where he stayed for three days before taking a train to Mumbai in May. The agent also helped him get a SIM card. Once in Mumbai, he wandered aimlessly for three days, living on the roadside. He got in touch with Pandey through another person and got the Worli restaurant job in June,” police said. They are on the trail of the agent.After losing his second job in the city, Shariful decided on committing a burglary, and surveyed locations across the ritzy parts of Bandra and Khar on Dec 31 and Jan 1. Police said before attack on Saif, Shariful walked 90mins to Bandra in the intervening night of Jan 15-16. “He carried housebreaking tools like a screwdriver, hammer, and hacksaw blade, which he had bought a few days prior. The knife he later used to attack the actor, he had stolen from the Thane restaurant where he used to work,” said an officer.“After the crime, he was in Bandra-Khar for hours before taking a train to Dadar. He was unaware till then that he had stabbed a famous actor. He told us during questioning that his attack on Saif was unplanned.”Police tracked Shariful after Pandey provided his Worli location and phone number. “We found that he used an e-wallet to pay Rs 6 for a cup of tea in Worli. His last location was traced to a labour camp in Thane. We found he had also paid Rs 60 for a plate of bhurji pav on Jan 18,” said an officer.Police learnt during Shariful’s questioning that he was a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and had tried to scale the walls of the actor’s Bandra bungalow Mannat “to get a dekko at the superstar” before the Saif incident. “He said his friends and family often told him that he looked like Shah Rukh Khan. That would puff him up,” the officer said.Police have seized Shariful’s mobile phone, cap, scarf and the shirt he changed after the crime. The items have been sent to forensics lab. But police are yet to recover the missing portion of the knife used to attack Saif.","Bangladeshi national Shariful Fakir, arrested for breaking into actor Saif Ali Khan's home and stabbing him last Thursday, was driven to crime because of extreme poverty, police said. “He chose Saif’s residence randomly.

Supreme Court explores ad hoc judges for criminal appeal backlog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-explores-ad-hoc-judges-for-criminal-appeal-backlog/articleshow/117438800.cms,"Supreme Court

SC says 2021 ad hoc judges order needs tweaking, seeks AG's view

NEW DELHI: As pending cases continue to mount in high courts because of multiple reasons, including judge vacancies not being filled, Supreme Court Tuesday said it was time to appoint ad hoc judges in HCs — invoking Article 224A of the Constitution — who would be part of division benches headed by a permanent judge of the HC and would adjudicate criminal appeals.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said the number of criminal appeals pending in HCs was substantial and per-judge pendency of cases too was acute, and that the apex court’s 2021 verdict needed to be modified to pave the way for appointment of ad hoc judges in HCs.As many convicts in criminal cases languish in jails waiting for their appeals to be heard, SC had earlier expressed concern over pendency of such cases.While examining the rate of disposal compared to filing of fresh criminal appeals in the Allahabad high court between 2000 and 2021, it came to light that a fresh appeal would take on average 35 years to be decided, as during the 21-year period, 1.7 lakh appeals were filed against disposal of only 31,000 cases.Pointing to pendency of criminal appeal cases, the bench said that around 63,000 cases were pending in Allahabad high court, 20,000 in Patna HC, 20,000 in Karnataka HC and 21,000 in Punjab and Haryana HC. The court said ad hoc judges could be appointed to deal with this problem but clarified that it would be allowed only to adjudicate cases of criminal appeals and no other case.“Per-judge pendency is also very high in some high courts. We have a feeling that criminal appeals before the division bench can be taken up by one sitting judge as the senior judge, and one ad hoc judge,” the bench said.The bench said the Supreme Court’s 2021 judgment, by which guidelines were framed for appointment of ad hoc judges, needed to be modified, and sought the opinion of attorney general R Venkataramani.The court had mentioned various trigger points for appointment of ad hoc judges in HCs, including if vacancies were more than 20% of the sanctioned strength.It had also clarified that the recourse to Article 224A was not an alternative to regular appointments.“We have given deep thought to the slightly different perspectives placed before us by way of affidavits by the different high courts and the Union of India. While emphasising that recourse to Article 224A is the necessity of the day, and without inhibiting the expanse of the powers conferred on the chief justice of the high court as per the Constitution, it would be in the fitness of things to lay down some guidelines for assistance of chief justices of high courts and to make the provision a ‘live letter’,” the court had said.","SC says 2021 ad hoc judges order needs tweaking, seeks AG's view.

Victim was gang-raped:

A woman was hiding behind curtains

Impossible for Roy to act alone:

No signs of struggle in seminar hall:

No one noticed anything amiss at nursing station

Roy was tortured into confession:

Multiple allegations and theories surfaced after the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year. Judge Anirban Das of Sealdah sessions court addressed these theories in a 172-page judgment, providing reasons to debunk each one while sentencing convict Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment Monday.Judge Das ruled out this possibility. “Rape was committed by only one person, and there was no evidence of gang rape,” the judgment reads.The autopsy report supported this, showing no fractures on the victim’s body, indicating that the assault was carried out by a single person, the judge said. The court acknowledged the prosecution’s failure to specify the nature of a white thick liquid found during the examination, but it was confirmed that it was not semen.: The victim’s parents had argued that another woman was involved, citing DNA profiles found during autopsy. However, Judge Das pointed out the poor sterilisation practices at the facility, which led to contamination. Other female bodies were lying on the floor.“The nipple swab contains the full DNA profile of the accused as well as of the victim and a very negligible profile of another female,” he said, ruling out the involvement of any other person.The court found that the cause of death was due to manual strangulation associated with smothering, both of which Roy could have carried out alone. The autopsy team confirmed the manner of death was homicidal and caused by these actions.While some items were undisturbed, such as the victim’s mobile phone, laptop, and exercise book, Judge Das highlighted other evidence indicating a struggle. “The water bottle was found lying on the dais, and a red blanket was used as a pillow,” he said. “I have no confusion in my mind to hold that the seminar room, more particularly the dais, again more precisely the mattress on the dais… was the scene of the crime.”: The defence questioned why the nursing station did not notice Roy entering the chest department. Judge Das dismissed this as speculative, saying: “In the wee hours of Aug 9, it was not the time of joining any duties. It is very hard to take into consideration such an imaginary argument.”The court found no evidence to support the claim that Roy was tortured into confessing. “It was not placed anywhere during the cross-examination that the accused was beaten while in police custody,” Judge Das wrote in his verdict, adding that no such allegations were presented during the investigation process.","Multiple allegations and theories surfaced after the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

NEW DELHI: Contrasting Rahul Gandhi ‘s criticism of India’s economy with the Narendra Modi govt’s achievements, BJP on Tuesday sought to highlight the success of the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme in attracting investments and fostering job creation .In a post on X, BJP IT department head Amit Malviya cited India’s emergence as a global mobile manufacturing hub, with significant production statistics for the financial year 2023-24, and mentioned the growth in the telecom equipment sector under the PLI scheme . He also referred to a Nabard report indicating growth in rural household incomes outpacing inflation, and compared the inflation rates and real wage growth between the UPA and the NDA regimes.BJP’s reaction came after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on microblogging site X claimed that the manufacturing sector ’s share in the economy has fallen to its lowest level in 60 years due to which people are struggling to find employment.“It is quite ironic that LoP Rahul Gandhi has once again chosen to paint a bleak picture of India’s economy, conveniently overlooking his own party’s troubled history,” Malviya added.Malviya claimed Modi govt’s initiatives, such as PLI scheme, have attracted investments exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore, leading to production & sales worth Rs 8.6 lakh crore, and generating over 6.8 lakh jobs as of Nov 2023.","BJP IT department head Amit Malviya cited India’s emergence as a global mobile manufacturing hub, with significant production statistics for the financial year 2023-24.

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami has rejected Congress’s criticism that the state cabinet’s decision Monday to approve rules for implementation of Uniform Civil Code was violative of the model code of conduct currently in force because of local body polls and said he would soon come out with the date of implementation.“UCC for Uttarakhand has been a work in progress since we promised it in our manifesto in 2022. Our commitment is absolute. Our first task was to draft it. It has since received the President’s assent. We are in the final stages of training our employees and will soon announce the implementation date,” Dhami told TOI.Congress has complained to EC about the state cabinet’s decision. The confrontation can only sharpen the fight between Congress and BJP in local body polls. Dhami has plunged himself headlong into the battle in what appears to be a gambit.BJP circles see it as a well-calculated one and reflective of the CM’s confidence that his image as a “doer” and his accessibility will work to the party’s advantage. BJP had won all five Lok Sabha seats in June 2024. While the third consecutive sweep of LS polls is unanimously attributed to PM Modi’s enduring popularity in the hills, many in the party feel Dhami’s toil was an important factor in the win in the bypoll for the Kedarnath seat.It was a tough contest and a defeat, coming after the party’s loss of Faizabad LS seat under which Ayodhya comes, would have compounded the embarrassment. It would have been a personal setback also for the CM.On whether approval of rules during the campaign was meant to insert UCC as an issue in elections, Dhami said, “It has been an issue since we put it on the manifesto, resulting in Uttarakhand becoming the first state after Goa to have a UCC.”He said Congress’s opposition was motivated by vote bank considerations. “Opposition has worked to disrupt the state’s demographic balance.

His elimination marks a significant milestone in weakening the CPI (Maoist) leadership, reducing its ideological base, and advancing India's goal to end Left-wing extremism by March 2026.

NEW DELHI: Ramchandra Reddy Pratap Reddy alias Chalapati was essentially a military ideologue and mentor to Madvi Hidma , commander of CPI (Maoist) armed wing PLGA’s dreaded ‘Battalion No. 1’ responsible for many fatal ambush-attacks, including the 2010 Dantewada massacre that killed 75 CRPF jawans.Sources in central security agencies described the elimination of Chalapati — the first central committee member to be killed in an anti-Maoist operation in Chhattisgarh, according to Gariaband SP Nikhil Rakhecha — as a significant milestone in weakening the CPI (Maoist) leadership as the Centre sets out to realise its goal of uprooting Left-wing extremism by March 31, 2026.Home minister Amit Shah posted on ‘X’ on Tuesday: “Another mighty blow to Naxalism. Our security forces achieved major success towards building a Naxal-free Bharat...”A senior IPS officer told TOI that Chalapati’s elimination, apart from reducing the strength of CPI (Maoist) central committee, will further erode the “ideological base” of the outfit comprising older, committed and educated cadres hailing from Andhra Pradesh.While the CPI (Maoist) politburo has shrunk with the arrest of members Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da in 2021 and Pramod Mishra in 2023, and killing of Kattakam Sudarshan in 2023, the strength has been reduced to 17-18 members with the arrest/ killing/ death of members like Sheela Marandi, Kanchanda, Mithilesh Mehta, Milind Teltumbde, B G Krishnamurthy, Haribhushan and Akkiraju Haragopal and now, Chalapati.“Barrring a few leaders from Jharkhand, the politburo/ CCM members hail from Andhra Pradesh. As they bow out with age, CPI (Maoist)’s next line of leadership will essentially be gun-wielding fighters with low ideological affinity. This sets the stage for weakening of the Maoist movement, and sits well with the goal to end Naxalism by March 2026,” said an officer.","Ramchandra Reddy Pratap Reddy, also known as Chalapati, a key CPI (Maoist) ideologue and mentor to commander Madvi Hidma, has been killed.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Birthright Citizenship: Why Indian-American Usha Vance cannot lose her US citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-american-usha-vance-cannot-lose-her-us-citizenship/articleshow/117430904.cms,"Vice President-elect JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, listens as her husband speaks during a dinner event at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Saturday, Jan. 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)

“Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.”

How new Trump order affects the Indian diaspora

Usha Vance defends husband’s resurfaced ‘childless cat lady’ comment as ‘quip’

On Tuesday, a Twitter handle claimed that JD Vance’s wife Usha Vance would lose her citizenship since her parents weren’t US citizens at the time of her birth. The theory comes after Donald Trump’s recent order in which he would overturn years of jus soli (birthright by soil) citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants or when the person’s mother was “lawful but temporary”.Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s. However, publicly available information does not specify the exact date when they became US citizens. Both have established successful careers in the U.S.; Krish Chilukuri is an aerospace engineer and lecturer at San Diego State University, and Lakshmi Chilukuri is a biologist and provost at the University of California, San Diego.The actual order read:Would this make Usha Vance, the first Indian-American Second Lady’s citizenship void? Well, not quite, since the order is only valid for those born within the US after 30 days from the date of the order. Ergo, there’s no way Usha Vance will lose her citizenship under the current Trump executive order.However, things aren't that rosy for many members of the diaspora.The order, which ends automatic birthright citizenship for children of certain legal non-immigrant visa holders, has left many families shocked. This significant shift in US immigration policy targets children born to individuals on temporary visas, such as H-1B work visas, H-4 dependent visas, or F-1 student visas, if at least one parent is not a green card holder or US citizen.Read: How the new Trump order could affect one million Indians in Green Card Queue? This decision directly impacts over one million Indians awaiting employment-based green cards, many of whom face decades-long backlogs. Previously, these families relied on the assurance that children born in the US would automatically gain citizenship, providing a pathway to later sponsor their parents. With this change, those children must either self-deport upon turning 21 or seek another visa status. Immigration attorneys argue this interpretation contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on US soil, barring exceptions like children of diplomats.The move has already prompted lawsuits from organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and immigration attorneys, challenging the EO's constitutionality. Legal experts, including Cyrus Mehta and Greg Siskind, predict the case will reach the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority may uphold Trump's interpretation. The EO asserts that the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" excludes individuals born to temporary visa holders, a claim heavily disputed by immigration advocates. They argue this interpretation deviates from established precedents, such as the Supreme Court ruling that granted citizenship to a child born to Chinese immigrants who were not US citizens.The order also underscores potential gender biases, explicitly mentioning ""mother"" and ""father"" roles, which critics view as an outdated perspective. Moreover, the ripple effects are significant: Indian families, already grappling with lengthy green card queues, now face additional uncertainty regarding their children’s futures.The policy shift has fuelled polarising opinions. While some applaud the decision as a step towards stricter immigration control, others criticise it as a punitive measure targeting law-abiding immigrants. Amidst this controversy, the fate of affected families and the legal battle over the EO’s validity hang in the balance, with far-reaching implications for US immigration policy and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.","Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s.

Well, that's changed. When the 3 wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government. We must fight back.""The photo with the post featured Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos seated prominently during Trump’s inauguration ceremony.Notably, Musk, the world’s richest man, has been appointed head of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration. This move has drawn major attention, as Trump’s close ties with tech giants mark a shift in his political alliances.Trump, himself a billionaire and one of the 400 wealthiest Americans, appears to have reconciled with Zuckerberg, who had previously been embroiled in a feud with him. Earlier this month, Zuckerberg was spotted meeting Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida's Palm Beach.Sanders was also present at Trump’s inauguration, appeared sitting in mitten-clad posture, a moment that shortly turned into a viral meme on social media.The event was attended by several former US presidents, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama , and Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.With his return to the presidency, Trump becomes only the second US president, after Grover Cleveland, to serve non-consecutive terms.","Bernie Sanders expressed concerns on Tuesday about the current political climate in US after Donald Trump's historic return to the presidency.

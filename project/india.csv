Raise strength of women judges: Ex-CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raise-strength-of-women-judges-ex-cji/articleshow/123742116.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a sharp reminder to the SC Collegium and the Centre about gender diversity in constitutional courts, former CJI N V Ramana Saturday said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in the constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.At a symposium at SRM School of Law, Justice Ramana said in the last 75 years, SC has had only 11 women judges, of whom three had taken oath four years ago on Aug 31, 2021, when he was the CJI. Of them twos have retired and the third one, Justice B V Nagarathna, will become first woman CJI in Sept 2027 for a very short period of 36 days. ""Our institutions must reflect our social fabric. Gender diversity and inclusivity is not tokenism. It is a necessity to enrich our perspectives with social realities. This issue needs a larger consideration. Inclusivity does not happen naturally... Bringing in inclusivity calls for concerted efforts at the highest level,"" he said.Justice Ramana highlighted how infrastructure issues had forced National Company Law Tribunal to issue a public notice on Sept 3 regarding the shutting down of three of its six courtrooms and said that during his tenure as CJI he had tried to persuade the govt and other stakeholders to create a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority to assess and supervise creation of adequate infrastructure for the three-tier justice delivery mechanism.The efforts did not fructify.The ex-CJI's plea for expeditious implementation of SC Collegium's recommendations for appointments to constitutional courts was taken forward by advocate A M Singhvi, who said for decades the HCs have been functioning with two-thirds of their sanctioned strength and the trial courts operate with four-fifths of their capacity of 25,000 judges.He said pendency of cases is directly linked to vacancy for judges in trial courts and HCs. Singhvi highlighted that govt and SC have worked out an MoP as per the law laid down by SC, which mandated govt has to expeditiously appoint candidates recommended by the SC Collegium.","Former CJI N V Ramana said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in the constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested the man who allegedly issued a bomb threat to the city’s traffic department. The accused, identified as Ashwin Kumar Supra (50), was traced and detained from Noida.Officials said Supra, originally a resident of Bihar, had sent the threat message using a mobile phone and SIM card, both of which have been seized by investigators.The accused is being brought to Mumbai for further questioning. Crime Branch officers said they are probing the motive behind the threat and whether others were involved in the incident.The arrest came after the Mumbai Traffic Police’s WhatsApp helpline received a threatening message on Thursday, claiming that 14 terrorists had entered the city with 400 kg of RDX planted in 34 vehicles.

Lakhs of people are expected to participate in the immersion of Lord Ganesh idols in the sea, other water bodies, and artificial ponds on Saturday.The police are particularly vigilant as the threat coincides with Anant Chaturdashi, the 10th day of the Ganesh festival, when large crowds gather for the final immersion ceremonies.","Police arrest man who allegedly issued a bomb threat to the city’s traffic department.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to Reuters.Since taking office, Trump has spent his first seven months raising tariffs sharply as part of his effort to reshape the global trading system, cut US trade deficits and push partner nations into making concessions.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district and declare a health emergency in the village. He ordered that all the people suffering with unexplained illness should be admitted to hospital.Naidu conducted a review meeting on death of around 20 people in Turakapalem village in the past two months with unknown disease. He said health camps should be conducted in the village on Saturday and Sunday and medical tests should be conducted to all and prepare health profile of everyone.He advised the health officials to take the assistance of AIIMS Mangalagiri and if necessary international medical experts. He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future.

He said that the mean age of the deceased is 55, while around seven deceased were aged above 70 years.Dismissing media reports linking Melioidosis as the reason behind the deaths, the health minister said that the blood test reports have not confirmed the Melioidosis bacteria and that chemical and biological tests are also being done to determine the exact cause.The minister toured Turakapalem village, visiting the victims' households, enquiring about their health condition, and consoling the bereaved family members, besides taking a first-hand review of the medical services being provided to the villagers at the special medical camp set up in the village.Meanwhile, Guntur DMHO Dr Vijaya Lakshmi informed that the blood culture test results of the blood samples collected from individuals showing fever symptoms will arrive on Saturday.",Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district.

Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008. He has reached five straight Grand Slam finals since his US Open appearance last year.Alcaraz has maintained a perfect record without dropping a set as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.Since April, Alcaraz has dominated with a 44-2 record, reaching finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" the Spaniard said.Sinner's record against Alcaraz in 2024 stands at 1-6, while maintaining an impressive 109-4 record against all other opponents.""We have played quite a lot this year. So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better.

‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked

US Official Claims India Will Backtrack On Tariff, Russian Oil, BRICS And Say Sorry To Donald Trump

""NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Saturday alleged that India did not purchase Russian oil before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while reiterating his claim that New Delhi buys it solely to profiteer.In a post on X, Navarro wrote, “Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russia oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukranians. Stop taking American jobs.”The remarks follow a post on Friday in which Navarro said: “India highest tariffs costs U.S. jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. U.S. taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins. Leftist American fake news.”Also read: Trump aide Navarro takes fresh swipe at India over Russian oil; blames tariffs for US job losses Navarro was angered by a Community Note on X that appeared below his post, which said, “India's Russian oil purchases are for energy security, not just profit, & don't violate sanctions. While India has some tariffs, the U.S. has a trade surplus with it in services. U.S. also continues to import certain commodities from Russia which is hypocritical.”Community Notes are created by contributors on X to provide additional context to potentially misleading posts. If enough contributors from different points of view rate a note as helpful, it becomes publicly visible.Navarro has repeatedly criticised India for continuing trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” labeling the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it profits from the war. In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he said: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected Navarro’s comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”","White House adviser Peter Navarro on Saturday alleged that India did not purchase Russian oil before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

SRINAGAR: Engineer Rashid “narrowly escaped” when a group of inmates in Tihar Jail pushed him and threw a gate at him, Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) headed by the Baramulla MP alleged in a statement.“Had it hit him directly, it could have been fatal. This is nothing short of a deliberate attempt to physically harm him,” the AIP statement claimed.Tihar sources confirmed that the MP was attacked by transgender inmates following an altercation about a week ago, and sustained minor injuries. He is currently lodged in jail no. 3 of Tihar, which houses three transgender inmates.The exact reason behind the altercation was under investigation, the sources said. The prison authorities, however, dismissed allegations of a murder conspiracy as baseless.Rashid’s party alleged that Kashmiris in Tihar were deliberately housed with “male transgenders”, who were encouraged to provoke and attack them.According to the AIP statement, the MP disclosed to his lawyer during a recent meeting that a “systematic campaign” of targeting Kashmiri detainees over the past three months had been started.Transgender inmates who were HIV positive and had the backing of “notorious gangsters” inside Tihar had been intentionally placed with Kashmiris, Rashid told his legal counsel.Citing his testimonial, AIP alleged that other Kashmiri inmates in Tihar had also been attacked and humiliated, and that the harassment intensified whenever prisoners began offering prayers, with “deliberate attempts made to disturb and provoke them”.The party demanded an independent probe into the matter and immediate guarantees for the safety and dignity of Rashid and all Kashmiri detainees.(With inputs from New Delhi)","Engineer Rashid “narrowly escaped” when a group of inmates in Tihar Jail pushed him and threw a gate at him, Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) claimed.

S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

Poll Should India continue to pursue its relationship with the US despite recent trade tensions? Yes, it's important for strategic interests No, we should focus on other alliances

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit.

This comes as assembly elections in states like West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu, along with Puducherry are set to take place in 2026, indicating the possibility of SIR in these states by the year-end.The intensive revision aims to identify and remove illegal foreign migrants by verifying place of birth, a step gaining importance amid crackdowns on migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar in several states. Meanwhile, the opposition has accused the Centre of targeting Bengali-speaking people across country, calling them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.The revision of the voters’ list in Bihar drew criticism from opposition parties, who alleged that the exercise could disenfranchise crores of eligible citizens due to lack of proper documents.The Election Commission introduced additional measures in the ongoing intensive revision of electoral rolls to address concerns over the enrollment of illegal migrants. These steps came amid opposition allegations that the poll panel has manipulated voter data to favor the ruling party.As part of the new measures, an additional declaration form has been made mandatory for certain applicants, particularly those seeking to register as voters or shift their enrollment from outside the state. Applicants are required to declare that they were born in India before July 1, 1987, and furnish supporting documents to establish their date and place of birth.For those born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, the declaration process requires submission of documents proving the date and place of birth of their parents. These safeguards, the Commission maintains, are designed to ensure that foreign nationals do not get included in the country’s voters’ list.","The Election Commission is set to meet on September 10 to discuss the preparedness of a pan-India rollout of special intensive revision (SIR) of voters' list.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

Poll Do you think the positive remarks between PM Modi and Trump will improve US-India relations? Yes, it will help strengthen ties No, tensions over tariffs remain

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday responded to US President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks describing him as a “great Prime Minister” and a “friend” amid tensions over tariff row. PM Modi said he “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocates” Trump’s sentiments.The remarks by the two leaders come at a time of strained bilateral ties, following Washington’s move to impose a 50% tariff on India.Reciprocating the sentiment, PM Modi wrote in a post on X: “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership.”Hours earlier, speaking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump underlined the strength of the relationship. “I always will. I’ll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He’s a great Prime Minister. I’ll always be friends, but I just don’t like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a very special relationship,” Trump said.“There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,” he added.Trump also addressed his earlier post on Truth Social in which he claimed the US had “lost India and Russia to China.”He reiterated his concerns over India’s oil trade with Moscow. “I’ve been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi as you know.

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission.

His daughters were born in Pakistan and later shifted with the family to Thalassery.The sisters applied for Indian citizenship, producing an NoC from Pakistan high commission instead of a renunciation certificate. They said under Pakistan's citizenship law, renunciation papers can only be issued after turning 21, and by then they had already surrendered their Pakistani passports.The single bench accepted this plea.The division bench disagreed, ruling that both minors and adults must formally renounce foreign citizenship to qualify.

India-UK Deal On Economic Offenders: PM Modi Pushes Starmer to Extradite Mallya, Nirav, Lalit Modi

NEW DELHI: A delegation from Britain’s crown prosecution service (CPS) recently inspected Tihar Jail in New Delhi, as part of India’s efforts to convince UK courts to clear the extradition of fugitives wanted on financial and criminal charges, reported news agency ANI.According to people familiar with the matter, the CPS team visited the high-security ward of Tihar and interacted with inmates. Indian authorities assured the delegation that international fugitives brought back to India would be housed in safe conditions and, if required, a special “enclave” could be built inside the jail to accommodate high-profile prisoners.The inspection comes against the backdrop of repeated objections raised by British courts in the past, which have rejected India’s extradition requests citing concerns about prison conditions. To address these hurdles, India has guaranteed that no accused will be subjected to illegal interrogation while in custody.Currently, 178 extradition requests by India are pending abroad, of which nearly 20 are with the United Kingdom. These include cases of arms dealers and individuals linked to Khalistani groups.Among the most high-profile cases are those of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya , accused of defaulting on over Rs 9,000 crore in bank loans, and diamond merchant Nirav Modi , the prime accused in the Rs 13,800 crore Punjab National Bank fraud.Modi, arrested in London in March 2019, has already had his extradition approved by the UK High Court but continues to remain in custody.In July this year, foreign secretary Vikram Misri reiterated that the Indian government was “making the case” with British authorities to fast-track the return of fugitives. India maintains that extradited individuals will be kept under humane conditions in Tihar and other facilities, in line with international standards.",A delegation from Britain’s crown prosecution service (CPS) recently inspected Tihar Jail in New Delhi.

New Delhi Locks Eyes With Trump After ‘Lost India’ Dig; Blasts Peter Navarro | Tariff War

Poll Should India continue its trade relations with Russia despite the ongoing conflict? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil and imposing tariffs that he says cost Americans their jobs.In a post on X on Friday, Navarro wrote: “FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins”His remarks came in response to a Washington Post article that said Washington’s harsh language toward New Delhi was worsening ties.Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” branding the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it was profiting from the war.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he had claimed: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected his comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them.”He added, “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”Trump himself has repeatedly described India as America’s “most tariffed partner,” calling the trade relationship a “totally one-sided disaster.” He argues that while India exports large volumes of goods to the US, its high tariffs restrict American companies from accessing the Indian market. A US appeals court recently ruled that several of Trump’s tariff measures were “illegal.”","Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow.

The report also cited an investigation by ED into a darknet-based Fentanyl syndicate in its 'best practices' section, emphasising the significance of joint investigations.The joint probe by ED and US' department of justice (DOJ), it said, had led to the dismantling of a major drug trafficking organisation which was laundering proceeds through virtual assets. Elaborating on the case, it said that in 2022, DOJ had sought assistance from the Indian govt under the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters to investigate a major drug trafficking organisation led by two brothers.The investigation, according to FATF, revealed that the brothers controlled over 8,500 bitcoins, valued at $150 million at the time, which were used for money laundering and to finance drug trafficking activities. The organisation concealed these assets and its activities through complex transactions involving cryptocurrency exchanges and dark web platforms.Responding to the US' request, ED had launched a parallel investigation focused on the organisation's financial networks and obtained key financial records uncovering transfers, through a digital payment service provider, exceeding Rs 5.5 crore to the entity.In April and May 2024, searches led to seizure of 268.2 bitcoins, worth Rs 130 crore, which were frozen, along with the provisional attachment of assets worth Rs 9.6 crore.""This case is a strong example of real-time, cross-border co-ordination between the authorities of India and the US. US officials travelled to India to assist in the investigation, including during interviews of the accused, contributing significantly to its progress,"" the report said.Additionally, home ministry has established a set of standardised guidelines for international co-operation which provide a clear and structured framework for managing incoming and outgoing MLA requests, it noted. ""By establishing a predictable and legally compliant process, the online MLA portal has enhanced India's capacity to work with foreign nations, reducing delays and miscommunication, while ensuring timely and effective responses to requests for legal assistance,"" it further said.","The Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) latest report has appreciated the efforts of Union home ministry's online portal for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) The report also cited an investigation by ED into a darknet-based Fentanyl syndicate in its 'best practices' section, emphasising the significance of joint investigations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123742191,imgsize-24638,width-400,resizemode-4/fatf.jpg"

There was a silver lining though - there were indications of a significant decline in mercury levels in Delhi during the period studied, compared with previous years.The global or natural background value of mercury in clean air is about 1.7 ng/m³ in the Northern Hemisphere and 1.3 ng/m³ in the Southern Hemisphere.The first-of-its-kind study - published recently in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health, by Springer - analysed data from 2018 to 2024 on gaseous elemental mercury, a key atmospheric pollutant. Researchers reported that Delhi's air contained, on an average, 6.9±4.2 nanograms of mercury per cubic metre (ng/m³), compared to 2.1±0.7 ng/m³ in Ahmedabad and 1.5 ±0.4 ng/m³ in Pune.This means each cubic metre of air in Delhi - roughly the amount a person breathes in an hour at rest - carries around 7 billionths of a gram of mercury on an average, compared to about 2 billionths in Ahmedabad and 1.5 billionths in Pune.Delhi's peak values were nearly 13 times higher than the global background level.

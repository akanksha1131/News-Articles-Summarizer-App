FARIDABAD: There was no foreboding of the extraordinary day that would reduce the Mehtos from a family of six to one.Not even that morning. June 10 bore the stamp of routine. The boys took their usual morning baths before the heatwave made an oven of their room. Their mother made parathas for breakfast. Their father, Manoj Mehto, lazed, ambled around the alley, spoke to a few neighbours. Like he did on days he did not go to work, which would be twice or thrice a week.""It was a normal Tuesday morning,"" Preeti told TOI on Wednesday, alone in a house - in fact, a room- where four boys and two adults packed in, each with a few inches marked out to sleep or sit, bedroom, living room and kitchen rolled into one.The little room in Subhash Colony would allow no secrets, at least not within its confines. As people living in other such dwellings on the road put it, it's so cramped that even thoughts could get heard.And yet, the storm raging in 36-year-old Mehto's mind made no noise. Preeti has to think hard to remember if anything was amiss. Yes, it was odd of him to put on new clothes. But it had seemed in tune with what Preeti read as a jovial mood and a desire to take the boys out to a park.""You come too,"" he insisted to her, speaking of a 'family outing'.""But I wasn't feeling well and had a lot of work to do at home, so I refused. I told him to take the children out. They all left and never returned...,"" a distraught Preeti said as neighbours crowded the house with one question - why?Preeti did not have an answer.Manoj had not gone to the park. He bought chips and cola and headed for the railway tracks nearby. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover. The boys had no inkling of what was to happen. For close to an hour, they sat there. One of the most horrifying deaths the country has seen unfolded next as a train - Golden Temple Express - ran them over. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on firm, making sure all five of them would be right in line when the train came. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders and held Pawan (10) and Kaaro (7) by their arms.Police have initiated an inquest and are still searching for a motive. After questioning different people, police officers said they had come to know that Manoj might have had some ""trust issues"" and was particularly peeved with a neighbour of Preeti's parents back at their home in Bihar's Lakhisarai who helped take her messages to them.""Preeti's parents did not have mobile phones, so she would call the neighbour, a man she refers to as a 'cousin', and request him to help her get in touch with them. There was nothing more to it,"" said Rajender Singh, in charge of the railway police post in Ballabgarh.The couple's neighbours in Subhash Colony said they hadn't heard any arguments between Manoj and Preeti. Preeti told police she didn't have any recent disagreement with Manoj. The two had fallen in love and got married 11 years ago.""We got married, and my sister married Manoj's brother. We shifted here (Faridabad) three years ago, and I stayed at home because he always asked me not to take a job and raise his kids well,"" Preeti said.Seema Devi, a neighbour who visited the couple's house on Wednesday, said she didn't know the family, but came to convey her condolences. ""We are all shattered by this very disturbing incident. I came to pay condolences and wanted to know what led the man to make such a decision,"" she said.A police officer said Mehto's and the boys' bodies are currently at the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital. ""Manoj's brother requested us to wait for the autopsy till he arrives in Faridabad. He will reach on Thursday, after which the post-mortem examination will be conducted,"" he said.","Manoj Mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders.

NEW DELHI: Meghalaya police on Wednesday revealed that Sonam Raghuvanshi 'Mangalsutra' gave away her cover after allegedly killing her husband, Raj Raghuvanshi, during their honeymoon.Meghalaya's Director General of Police I Nongrang said that cops pursued Sonam as a prime suspect after they found her 'mangalsutra' and ring from the suitcase at the homestay in Sohra.""We recovered Sonam's 'mangalsutra' and a ring from the suitcase the couple abandoned at a homestay in Sohra,"" DGP Nongrang said.""A married woman leaving behind the ornaments gave us a clue to pursue her as a suspect in the case,"" he added.The couple walked into the homestay in Sohra on May 22 without any prior booking, another police officer, who is part of the investigation, told news agency PTI.They did not get a room there, and thus they decided to keep their suitcase at the homestay, as it would be troublesome to trek over 3,000 steps with it to the Nongriat village to see the double-decker root bridge, he said.While their suitcase remained at the Sohra homestay, they spent the night at a homestay in Nongriat before checking out early on May 23.They trekked back to Sohra, took their scooter from the parking, and went to Weisawdong Falls, where Raja was allegedly killed by the three contract killers in front of his wife, he added.""The accused persons have admitted to the crime, and with all the evidence, there is no room to deny,"" the police officer said.Meanwhile, a Shillong court sent Sonam, along with her four aides, to eight-day police custody.

BHOPAL: The design of the newly constructed Aishbagh railway overbridge in Bhopal has come under scrutiny, with experts raising concerns and state minister Vishwas Sarang set to visit the site on 14 June for inspection.The overbridge is not yet open to traffic. Officials are considering correcting the identified issues before its formal inauguration. Similar concerns had earlier been raised about the Ganesh Mandir–Gayatri Mandir flyover, which was inaugurated by chief minister Mohan Yadav.Following media reports and expert inputs, some engineers involved in that project were suspended.“The turn in the middle of the overbridge at the right angle is an issue. Bhaiya (Sarang) has taken up the issue with engineers involved in the project and correction as required would be made in the design,” said Mukesh Lodhi, PRO to Sarang. He confirmed the minister’s scheduled visit.Retired chief engineer, PWD, V K Amar, told, “Design of the overbridge is glaringly faulty. Whenever there is a turn on an overbridge, you give a curve so as to alert the driver about the turn ahead but here, you have a turn on the right angle without any curve and any driver would be taken by surprise at the turn and it would become an accident-prone area.""""The design will have to be altered by giving a curve 100 metres ahead of the actual turn, so that a driver is ready for the turn as it arrives,"" he said.The Rs 18 crore overbridge was completed after an eight-year delay. Local residents have also raised concerns.“Residents waited ten years for this bridge. Instead of relief upon its completion, the community raised significant safety issues. The primary concern centres on the sharp 90-degree turn at the bridge’s peak, which vehicles must traverse, posing considerable risks,” said Aslam, a resident of Aishbagh locality.Railway authorities clarified that their responsibility was limited to the section over the tracks. “We are responsible for the bridges built over the railway tracks. The approach roads of the bridge were built by PWD,” said Nawal Agrawal, PRO of Bhopal Railway Division.An engineer associated with the project, speaking toon condition of anonymity, cited limited space and the presence of a nearby metro station as factors behind what he described as a “distinctive design”.PWD officials said an inspection team had assessed the site and would submit a report. Additional Chief Secretary (PWD) Neeraj Mandoli did not respond to calls or messages.",The design of the Aishbagh railway overbridge in Bhopal has come under scrutiny.

The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.","Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention.

Engine failure, bird hit among several theories

On Cam: How Boeing 787 Whistleblower's Disaster Warning Was Ignored | Ahmedabad Crash | Air India

DGCA statement hints at dual engine failure |

MUMBAI: Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport - many questions followed, from those who have flown commercial airliners. On social media, pilots were asking:1. Why was the aircraft landing gear not retracted?2. Did the aircraft suffer a dual engine failure?3. Did the engines die because of possible fuel contamination or blockage?4. Were the flaps on the wings lowered for take-off?5. Could a bird hit have contributed to the crash?The final investigation report into the AI-171 accident, set to be released before June 12 next year, will have a detailed analysis of probable causes and contributory factors. But for aviation professionals, the two videos offered many clues.Also read: Air India Ahmedabad-London flight crashes near airport shortly after takeoff; 241 dead ""Within 5 secs of lift off, pilots normally put the landing gear up,"" said Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert. Capt Manoj Hathi, ex-Air India official who has held posts of director (ops) and director (air-safety) said: ""As soon as a positive rate of climb is reached, the landing gear is retracted.""A lowered landing gear increases drag and fuel consumption, while reducing aircraft speed. Retracting the landing gear allows for a smooth aerodynamic flow helping the aircraft climb up. But the clips showed the landing gear extended even as the plane climbed to over 400 feet above ground.Also read: Ahmedabad air crash: Why accidents are common during take-offs, landings What could be the reason why AI-171 had not retracted its landing gear although it had climbed to a height of around 400 feet?""In case there is a distraction the pilots could forget to put the gear up.The distraction could be dual engine failure, bird hit or combination of both. The plume of dust as the aircraft crosses the runway end shows it was low on power and possibly a dual engine problem,"" said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh.Capt Manoj Hathi, a former AI official, said, ""It's possible that a dual engine flame-out was the reason the landing gear could not be retracted. Dual engine failure could occur due to bird ingestion or fuel contamination. Looking at the trajectory and body angle of the aircraft, it appears as if the aircraft has stalled because of loss of speed.""Other pilots, who requested anonymity, too, spoke about dual engine failure and possible fuel contamination. The possibility of a dual engine failure is a rare event with about seven documented accidents in the past seven decades.DGCA in its statement said the pilots gave a MAYDAY call seconds after take-off, further supporting the theory that a dual engine failure occurred probably after the aircraft crossed the speed beyond which a take-off cannot be safely aborted.Video clips show the aircraft gliding and descending over a congested area chock-a-block with buildings. Seconds later, the aircraft nose is raised - AI-171's pilots were probably trying to keep the aircraft from crashing in a congested locality. But raising the nose results in loss of airspeed.The clip shows the aircraft disappear from view and crash. But even if the pilots had not pulled up the nose it would have continued to glide, descend and eventually crash, said Capt Singh. The other point was the flaps - aerodynamic devices that are lowered to increase lift on the wing. While some pilots said the flaps were not lowered as is the norm during take-off, others said the pictures show they were lowered.Investigation into aircraft accidents carried out by civil aviation authorities such as the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) follow norms laid down in the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annex 13. It states that the primary objective of an investigation should not be to assign blame, but to identify and prevent future similar incidents.Under Annex 13, a preliminary report should be ready within 30 days of the event. But ICAO leaves it to the state (India, in this case) to decide whether to make it public or keep it private. The final report, though, which should be published within a year of the accident, is made public.","Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport.

No more tour, all touchdowns—Taylor Swift to support Travis Kelce every step of the 2025 season







As the NFL gears up for the 2025 season, Taylor Swift is preparing for a quieter, more grounded fall — and it’s all by choice. For the first time since her relationship with Travis Kelce began in 2023, the global superstar will head into football season without the weight of a world tour pulling her in opposite directions.“Taylor is really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season. Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule,” an insider shared exclusively with PEOPLE. The change marks a significant shift in their relationship dynamic, offering both Swift and Kelce the rare luxury of time.In the past two seasons, the couple managed to stay close despite crisscrossing continents and balancing high-pressure careers. “The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible. It wasn’t easy but they made it work,” the source added. Their ability to maintain their connection through it all has become a testament to their commitment.Swift officially wrapped her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024 in Vancouver. Spanning five continents and grossing over $2 billion in ticket sales, the tour became the highest-grossing in history.But now, without rehearsals, flights, and nightly performances filling her calendar, the 14-time Grammy winner has space to breathe — and cheer.With her schedule finally free, Swift is expected to be a more regular face in the Arrowhead Stadium stands. “Her schedule is much more open now that the Eras Tour is wrapped and she’s genuinely excited to have the time and flexibility to show up for Travis more consistently,” the source noted. “Taylor plans to be at as many of his games as possible.”That’s good news for Kansas City fans. While all eyes remain on Patrick Mahomes and his offensive arsenal — including Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown, and, of course, Kelce — the added energy from Swift’s presence brings its own kind of buzz to game day.After their public debut in September 2023, Swift’s regular appearances at Chiefs games, including the AFC Championship and Super Bowl LVIII, became headline moments. Now, without international flights cutting into her weekends, she and Kelce have a chance to settle into something more stable.“It’s a chance for them to settle into more of a routine and they’re both really happy about that,” the insider added.With football season approaching and fewer distractions in the way, Swift and Kelce are entering a new chapter — one that could be defined less by chaos and more by companionship.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld gives first clear look at massive engagement ring after secretive romance with Josh Allen","For the first full season since they started dating, Taylor Swift is not juggling a packed tour schedule.

Patrick Mahomes may have fallen just short of a historic Super Bowl three-peat at the end of the 2024 NFL season, but his life off the field has never looked brighter. As 2025 kicks into high gear, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is thriving in both his personal and professional life, celebrating the arrival of his third child and preparing for yet another demanding NFL season.The Mahomes family welcomed a new member on January 12—a baby girl named Golden Raye. She joins her siblings Sterling Sky, born in February 2021, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, born in November 2022. With the addition of Golden, the Mahomes household has grown to five, and the couple seems perfectly content with that number.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick’s wife and longtime partner since their high school days, shared her thoughts on growing their family during a candid chat on the WHOOP Podcast. “Nope. We're done, we're done for a while. Three,” she said with a smile. “I don't know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you're done, but I think three is all I need.”Patrick echoed his wife’s words in a press conference shortly after Golden’s birth. “I'm good with three for right now,” he stated. “We'll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three. So, we've had three. And we'll stick there for a while and see if we need to come back and get another one later on.”The couple, who began dating in 2012 and married in a stunning Hawaiian ceremony in 2022, have navigated life’s biggest transitions together—from college sweethearts to NFL fame, and now parenthood. Their bond remains strong as they juggle high-profile careers and family responsibilities.As a three-time Super Bowl champion, Mahomes isn’t taking his foot off the gas. He’s already back in action, attending OTAs with the Chiefs ahead of his ninth season. The team is gearing up for a global showcase, with their season opener set in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers—marking an international milestone for both the franchise and the league.Away from the stadium lights, Mahomes also opened up about the support he receives from Brittany, especially in terms of inspiration. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose. That kind of confidence is powerful; it pushes me to be better every day.”With family fulfillment and football focus going hand-in-hand, Mahomes seems more driven than ever.

Jason Kelce can’t believe Eagles fan got him tattooed nude







Jason Kelce has always had a unique relationship with Philadelphia Eagles fans — built on mutual love, grit, and a healthy dose of humor. But even the future Hall of Famer was left scratching his head when a rather bold tribute started making rounds on social media.The buzz began when Crossing Broad shared a video featuring a passionate Eagles fan who got a tattoo of Jason Kelce — completely nude, pin-up style. Tattoo artist Joe the Wizard created the unconventional ink, complete with an eagle drawn strategically over Kelce’s groin area. The tattoo, permanently inked on a forearm, quickly went viral for all the obvious reasons.Jason, known as much for his personality as his dominance on the field, took to X (formerly Twitter) after seeing the tattoo and delivered a classic Kelce reaction:""I'm not sure if I should be offended or flattered."" He later replied to his own post, ultimately deciding, ""I think it’s more flattered, it’s a generous bird, good sized head."" That prompted a playful comment from fellow former NFL star Andrew Whitworth, who added,""I was going to say strong Beak!""Kelce’s reaction struck the perfect balance of humor and humility — much like the man himself, who spent 13 seasons with the Eagles, earning six first-team All-Pro selections and anchoring one of the NFL's toughest offensive lines. Even in retirement, Kelce’s popularity hasn’t faded. If anything, his post-football charisma — now amplified by his podcast and TV appearances — is fueling even more fan devotion.However, no one was more surprised than his wife, Kylie Kelce. Commenting on the original TikTok video, she expressed a mix of amusement and disbelief: ""Excuse me???"" She followed that up with, ""I don’t even know where to start.""The tattoo drama comes right as Kylie prepares for Father’s Day festivities.On the June 12 episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie jokingly considered gifting Jason something outrageous to match his unique fashion sense.""I'd probably buy him a banana hammock,” she laughed, referencing the infamous Borat outfit. Then she added with a smile,“Just kidding. Four kids is enough.”Despite the chaos, Kylie did confirm she’s made dinner plans at a restaurant both she and Jason love: “The key is that Jason also loves it, so that's a win-win right there.”From outrageous tattoos to heartfelt family dinners, the Kelce household continues to live at the intersection of hilarity, humility, and heart — making them one of football’s most beloved families.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s fall Sundays are booked, ready to back Travis Kelce’s quest for another Super Bowl: ""She’s not juggling a packed tour schedule""","A Philadelphia Eagles fan got a nude tattoo of Jason Kelce on their leg.

A complicated family dynamic with children from multiple relationships

Balancing NFL stardom with fatherhood isn’t always easy





Tyreek Hill may be known to NFL fans as the explosive wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, but off the field, the 31-year-old juggles an equally demanding role: being a father to seven children. Known as ""Cheetah"" for his unmatched speed, Hill’s family life has often sparked headlines—not just for the number of children he has, but also for the complexities that come with raising them while maintaining a high-profile sports career.Tyreek Hill reportedly shares his seven children with multiple women, including his now estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro. Their youngest, Capri, was born in 2024. Before Vaccaro, Hill was in a long-term relationship with Crystal Espinal, with whom he shares three children: Zev (born in 2014), and twins Nakeem and Nyla (born in 2017). The twins were born after the couple had split, which led Espinal to file a paternity suit to dispel rumors surrounding the timeline of their breakup and the children’s birth.Despite the legal complexities, Hill embraced fatherhood wholeheartedly. “I just feel like I’m truly blessed,” he told USA Today in 2020. “Each and every day I get up, I get a chance to play the game that I love, be around people who are loving, and then I get a chance to be around my kids and be in their lives.I feel like I’m truly blessed.""Managing life as a professional athlete and a father to seven kids is no small feat. Hill candidly discussed this during a 2023 appearance on the It Needed to be Said podcast. “Earlier in my career, bro, I'd come home and my kids would be like, ‘Dad, it's play time, let's play, let's play, let's run around.’ I'm like, 'Bro, I'm tired. Your dad is tired.' Like I got to learn these plays and I gotta watch these films.""These struggles reveal a more human side to the NFL superstar—one that fans rarely see behind the game-day highlights and touchdowns.

GANDHINAGAR: For Gujarat's former chief minister Vijay Rupani , the number 1206 was a symbol of fortune, a silent companion through the years. He believed in it with a tender faith. The registration plates of all his vehicles - scooters and cars - had 1206 on them. Friends say it had always been his lucky charm.But fate gave it a cruel twist.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip.

Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

US officials have said there is no current evidence to justify grounding Boeing 787 aircraft, after a deadly Air India crash killed over 240 people on Thursday, when a Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad and crashed into a residential complex just 30 seconds after take-off.Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Acting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Chris Rocheleau said investigators were still reviewing the facts surrounding the incident, reports news agency Reuters.Duffy confirmed that officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the FAA, and representatives from Boeing and engine-maker GE Aerospace would be travelling to India to assist with the investigation.""They have to get on the ground and take a look. But again right now it'd be way too premature,"" said Duffy. ""People are looking at videos and trying to assess what happened, which is never a strong, smart way to make decisions on what took place.""Duffy said that the FAA is actively reviewing available data in coordination with Boeing and GE. He also stressed that the US government will act swiftly if any safety concerns arise.""The FAA is prepared to send additional resources to get the data we need to ensure the safety of the flying public,"" Duffy said. ""We will not hesitate to implement any safety recommendations that may arise.

A bold hairstyle change that has deeper meaning for the NFL veteran

New look, new game: How Travis Kelce’s transformation reflects a career reboot





Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has once again found himself at the center of attention—but this time, it's not for his jaw-dropping touchdown grabs or viral podcast moments. Instead, the three-time Super Bowl champion has debuted a brand-new look that has fans and critics alike buzzing, and it may say more about his mindset than it does about his hair.Kelce appeared at his cousin Tanner Corum’s wedding in Knoxville, Tennessee, with noticeably longer hair—a sharp departure from the polished, clean-cut image he’s carried for much of his career. Accompanying him was none other than Taylor Swift , making yet another public splash for one of pop culture’s most talked-about couples.While photos of Kelce’s new hairstyle quickly went viral, social media reactions were anything but unanimous. One fan joked, “Looks like someone’s grandfather,” poking fun at the dramatic transformation. But others praised the look, interpreting it as a sign of growth—both personal and professional.And that interpretation may hold weight.After a difficult 2024 season that ended in a crushing Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, retirement whispers grew louder for the 35-year-old tight end. But instead of walking away, Kelce doubled down, signing a reported $17 million extension to stay with the Chiefs.According to those close to the team, Kelce’s energy has shifted. He’s leaned into wellness, taken up padel as a low-impact fitness tool, and slimmed down considerably. “He looks like he’s dropped a few pounds and is moving better than I’ve seen in a while,” a Chiefs insider shared. Even Patrick Mahomes commented that Kelce looks “fresher” and “leaner” heading into 2025.While Kelce’s commitment to excellence on the field is nothing new, his relationship with Taylor Swift has added an extra layer to his off-field persona. Whether it’s showing up at weddings or appearing in commercials, Kelce seems more comfortable than ever in the spotlight.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce preparing for a graceful NFL exit? 5 veterans who might retire after the 2025 season With his physical transformation, mindset reset, and strong connection with Mahomes still intact, the Chiefs veteran is clearly not done chasing greatness.

Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites. The Iranian state-run news agency acknowledged the explosions. Air-raid sirens preventatively rang out in Israel.The strikes occurred amid heightened tensions regarding Iran's nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors issued its first censure against Iran in 20 years on Thursday.

He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”Iran warned Israel after it launched ""Operation Rising Lion"" on Thursday, said they will face a “severe punishment.”Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,” Khamenei says.“With this crime, the Zionist regime has set itself for a bitter and painful fate and it will definitely receive it,” Khamenei says.Defence minister Israel Katz issued warnings about potential missile and drone attacks, declaring an emergency situation requiring adherence to protective measures. “In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.The statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it saidSecretary Rubio confirmed Israel's independent action, stating the US received prior notification of strikes deemed necessary for Israeli self-defence.

Reed further stated: ""I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.""Numerous commercial aircraft were traversing Iranian airspace during the strikes, as evidenced by flight tracking data.After the Israeli strike commenced, some aircraft continued their routes through Iranian airspace, whilst others swiftly adjusted their flight paths to exit the region.Several countries had previously restricted their aircraft from flying over Iran due to ongoing regional tensions.A senior Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that Israel has conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear and military installations, though specific locations were not disclosed.During the operational briefing, the official outlined three primary concerns regarding Iran: They claim Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons, despite US intelligence assessments indicating otherwise. Additionally, Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal and its distribution of weaponry to regional groups like Hezbollah and Hamas were cited as significant threats.During the Tehran explosions, Donald Trump was observed socialising with Congressional members on the White House lawn. He continued meeting and photographing with guests, though it was not clear whether he had been briefed about the situation.Earlier that day, Trump had commented that whilst an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities was not immediate, it remained a strong possibility.The US government had taken precautionary measures, including withdrawing diplomatic staff from Baghdad and offering evacuation options to US military families across the Middle East region.After the Israel attacked Iran, the oil prices surged over six percent on Friday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme. The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"".Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites.""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement, naming the operation ""Rising Lion"", reported news agency AFP.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility at Natanz... We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme,"" he said, adding that Israel had also hit Iranian nuclear scientists ""working on the Iranian bomb,"" he said.""This military operation aims to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as necessary to eliminate that threat. For decades, the tyrants in Tehran have openly and brazenly called for the destruction of Israel,"" he said.Israeli PM claimed that Iran has produced ""enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs"" and that it could produce ""a nuclear weapon in a very short time"".""They have backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs - nine. In recent months, Iran has taken steps it had never taken before - steps toward weaponising that enriched uranium. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be within a year. It could even be within a few months - less than a year. This poses a clear and present danger to Israel’s very existence. Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime,” Netanyahu said in an address shortly after the ""Operation Rising Lion"".The attack comes hours after Iran announced that it has built and plans to activate a third nuclear enrichment facility, escalating tensions with the United Nations just after the UN’s atomic watchdog censured the country for failing to meet its nonproliferation commitments aimed at preventing the development of nuclear weapons.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organisation said in a joint statement.The timing also coincides with the efforts of the United States to actively lead negotiations with Tehran aimed at reaching a deal to restrict Iran’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons.The Israeli strike followed months of friction between US President Donald Trump and Netanyahu over how best to confront Iran. Netanyahu has consistently pushed for military action as a way to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions.On Thursday, Trump reiterated his opposition to an Israeli attack, warning that such a move could derail diplomatic efforts. ""I think it would blow it,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged the complexity of the situation, adding, ""It might help it actually, but it could also blow it.""Earlier, Trump had dismissed an Israeli plan to launch a strike against Iran, making it clear that he wanted time to pursue a negotiated settlement with Tehran. Just two weeks ago, he said he had cautioned Netanyahu against attacking while talks were under way.However, those negotiations have stalled in recent weeks, and it remains uncertain how much effort Trump made to prevent this latest escalation.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said that the strikes by Israel were ""unilateral"" and that US' priority is now to protect the American forces in the region.Rubio said that Israel said that the strikes were done in the spirit of self-defence.He said that Iran must not harm US interests or personnel.In a statement, Rubio said, ""Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran.

The United States has made it clear that it is not involved in Israel’s latest strikes on Iran and has warned Tehran against targeting American forces in response. The statement came from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio late Thursday, just hours after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran.""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,"" Rubio said. He added, ""Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.""Israel's attack caused multiple explosions across Tehran early Friday, raising fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Following the strikes, Rubio confirmed that Israel had informed Washington in advance, calling the action necessary for its self-defence. According to Rubio, Israel claimed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear ambitions.The airstrikes came shortly after US president Donald Trump advised both countries against such action, saying it could damage the chances of reaching a peaceful agreement. Talks between Washington and Tehran on Iran’s nuclear programme were scheduled to enter a sixth round this Sunday in Oman.The US department of State had urged American citizens to stay alert and follow local news amid rising tensions in the Middle East.In a post on X, the department had said, “Due to high tensions in the Middle East, the security environment remains complex and can change quickly. We remind US citizens in Israel and the broader region to remain cautious and monitor the news for updates.”The Israeli military expects its operation targeting Iran’s nuclear programme and long-range missile sites to continue for several days, according to The Times of Israel. The IDF is bracing for heavy retaliation from Iran following tonight’s airstrikes.“At the end of the operation, there will be no nuclear threat from Iran,” military officials said. They added, “We are in a window of strategic opportunities. We have reached the point of no return, and there is no choice but to act now.”",Rubio says U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes against Iran.

Understanding Blood Pressure and Cholesterol readings

Considering the fast-paced world we live in, having lifestyle diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure has become quite common these days. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is often called the 'silent killer' because it can quietly damage your body for years without showing any major symptoms. If left uncontrolled, it can also lead to serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, and even vision loss. Understanding what causes high blood pressure in the first place can help one prevent or manage it well in the long run. Here we list some of the top medical and lifestyle reasons for high blood pressure:Having a diet which is high in salt, saturated fats, and processed foods can lead to high blood pressure. How? Sodium makes your body retain water, thus increasing the volume of blood your heart has to pump. This causes higher pressure on your arteries thus leading to high blood pressure. According to The American Heart Association , a person should not have more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, and it should ideally be limited to 1,500 mg for most adults. And so, frequently having processed and restaurant foods is one of the biggest culprits for high blood pressure, as they are often loaded with salt and saturated fats, that are terribly unhealthy.Regular exercise strengthens the heart; even a 30-minutes walk can do wonders in the long run. A stronger heart can pump blood with less effort, reducing pressure on the arteries. On the contrary, a lack of physical activity causes weight gain, an increased heart rate, and higher blood pressure. As per the Mayo Clinic , ""Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of many (health) conditions.These conditions include obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, stroke and certain types of cancer.""When you are overweight, it forces the heart to work harder to pump blood throughout the body and it raises blood pressure. Additionally, fat tissue can produce substances that affect your blood vessels, further increasing pressure. And so, losing even a small amount of weight can make a huge difference in one's overall health. According to a study titled ' Weight Loss and Improvement in Comorbidity: Differences at 5%, 10%, 15%, and Over ' by Donna H Ryan and Sarah Ryan Yockey, ""Modest weight loss (5 to 10%) is also associated with improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and HDL cholesterol.""Stress not just affects one's mental health— but also their physical health. When you’re stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which temporarily raise your blood pressure. Additionally, stress can also lead to poor choices like overeating, having processed or sugary foods, smoking, or drinking-- all of raises the blood pressure. And so, practising relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, journaling, deep breathing can help one destress. The American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that managing stress effectively lowers your risk of hypertension.According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute , ""some people, including Black people, older adults, and people who have chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, are more sensitive to salt in their diet."" This in turn leads to high blood pressure. For example, kidney disease affects your body’s ability to filter fluids, which can increase blood volume and pressure. And so, secondary hypertension (which is caused by an underlying medical condition) should always be treated by addressing the root cause. Getting regular health check-ups and consulting the doctor can help monitor one's high blood pressure and other medical issues.Apart from having poor lifestyle, high blood pressure is also caused due to genes. If high blood pressure runs in your family, you are at a higher risk of developing it yourself. Certain genes can affect how your body balances salt and processes hormones that regulate blood pressure. While you can’t change your genes, you can still lower your risk by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. According to research published in The Lancet , genetics account for about 30–50% of blood pressure variation.Smoking damages your blood vessels and causes hardening of the arteries, which directly leads raises the blood pressure. Alcohol, especially when consumed in large quantities, can also increase blood pressure and reduce the effectiveness of medications. And so, one of the most effective ways of lowering blood pressure is by quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake. As per the CDC , moderate alcohol drinking is: For men—two drinks or less in a day, for women—one drink or less in a day.It is important to get the blood pressure tested on a regular basis.","High blood pressure, or hypertension, is often called the'silent killer' because it can quietly damage your body for years without showing any major symptoms. Understanding what causes high blood pressure in the first place can help one prevent or manage it well in the long run.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121777847,imgsize-31794,width-400,resizemode-4/121777847.jpg"

Harvard study says Vitamin D may actually slow down aging,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/harvard-study-says-vitamin-d-may-actually-slow-down-aging/articleshow/121790796.cms,"Poll Have you noticed any benefits from taking vitamin D? Yes, I feel better with it No, I haven’t noticed a difference

Sources of Vitamin D

What if popping a daily vitamin could help keep you younger—at least at the cellular level? A new study from researchers at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia says that vitamin D supplements might actually slow down biological aging. Yes, you read that right.The study, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, focused on telomeres—tiny protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes. As we age, these tips wear down, which is linked to age-related diseases like heart problems, certain cancers, and more. The shorter the telomeres, the more worn out your cells are.Now, here’s where it gets cool: Researchers looked at data from the well-known VITAL study—a long-term clinical trial where participants were randomly given either vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day), omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day), or a placebo. The telomere sub-study followed over 1,000 people (women 55+ and men 50+) for up to four years.The results? Those taking vitamin D had significantly less telomere shortening compared to those on placebo. In fact, vitamin D slowed the rate of cellular aging by what would’ve been the equivalent of nearly three years! That’s a pretty big deal when you're trying to keep your cells (and yourself) feeling young.Omega-3s, on the other hand, didn’t seem to make much of a difference in this case—at least not for telomere length.While more research is always welcome, this study adds to growing evidence that vitamin D does more than just support your bones and immunity. It may also be quietly working behind the scenes to keep your cells younger, longer.“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, the principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health at Harvard Medical School. “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease,” said Manson.“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.Vitamin D is one of those nutrients that quietly does a ton of important stuff in your body—and most of us don’t even realize we’re running low on it. Nicknamed the “sunshine vitamin” because your body makes it when sunlight hits your skin, vitamin D helps your bones stay strong by making sure you absorb enough calcium. Without it, your bones can get weak, brittle, and way more prone to breaking.But that’s just the beginning. Vitamin D also supports your immune system—so you're better equipped to fight off colds, flu, and even chronic inflammation. Some studies say it may help improve your mood, too, and there’s growing research linking low vitamin D to issues like depression, fatigue, and brain fog. The catch? A lot of us don’t get enough sun, especially if we’re indoors all day or live in cloudy places. That’s where food and supplements come in—fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, or a daily D3 capsule can help fill the gap.Don’t ghost your vitamin D. So if you’ve been slacking on your vitamin D intake (especially if you're not getting much sun), this might be the nudge you needed to start adding it to your daily routine.These are some foods in which Vitamin D can be found naturally, and you effectively include it in your day to day diet.SalmonMackerelSardinesTunaCod liver oilEgg yolksBeef liverCheese","A new study says that vitamin D supplements might actually slow down biological aging.

Heart blockage occurs when the arteries supplying blood to your heart can get partially or fully blocked (due to the build up of cholesterol) leading to a heart attack. Globally, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world, and is a medical emergency. Unfortunately, without regular check ups, heart disease can be tricky to detect, and a sudden heart attack can be fatal. Even though blood tests, ECGs and angiograms are the best ways to diagnose a heart condition, there are a couple of warning signs you can watch out at home too. If you are experiencing these 3, rush to a doctor immediately... (source: drjeremylondon) One of the most common warning signs of heart blockage is extreme chest pain or tightness. This pain (which is not severe) often feels like pressure, squeezing, heaviness, or a tight band around the chest. People usually describe it as ""an elephant sitting on the chest"". This discomfort usually occurs when your heart is not getting enough oxygen-rich blood because of narrowed arteries.This chest pain often improves with rest. If you notice chest pain or tightness that comes on during physical activity or emotional stress and then gets better when you rest, it is a red flag for heart blockage.This type of pain is called angina and signals that your heart is struggling to get enough blood while pumping.Heart blockage doesn’t always cause pain only in the chest. Sometimes, the pain can spread or radiate to other parts of the upper body. Common areas include the jaw (especially the lower left side), left arm, neck, shoulder, back, or even the upper stomach. This radiating pain happens because the nerves in these areas share pathways with the heart, so the brain interprets the pain signals as coming from these places.If you experience this type of pain, especially alongside chest tightness or shortness of breath, it is a serious warning sign. The pain may feel like a toothache in the jaw or a heavy ache in the arm.Another symptom to watch for is shortness of breath, especially during physical activity or emotional stress. When the heart does not get enough blood, it cannot pump efficiently, which can make you feel breathless. You may also feel unusually tired or weak, even with normal activities.These symptoms occur because your heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen to meet your body’s demands. If you notice these signs along with chest discomfort, it’s important to seek medical help immediately.Heart blockage is usually caused by a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque inside the coronary arteries. This plaque narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. When the heart muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen-rich blood, it causes pain and discomfort known as angina.The pain improves with rest because resting lowers the heart’s demand for oxygen. However, if the blockage worsens or becomes complete, it can cause a heart attack, which is a medical emergency.It is important to know that heart disease can exist without any symptoms at all. This is called silent coronary artery disease. Many people have plaque buildup in their arteries but do not feel any pain or discomfort until the blockage becomes severe or causes a heart attack.Silent heart attacks are also possible, where the heart muscle is damaged without obvious symptoms. This is why regular checkups and heart health monitoring are important, especially if you have risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, obesity, or a family history of heart disease.If you experience chest pain or tightness that lasts more than a few minutes or comes and goes, especially with pain radiating to your jaw, arm, or neck, get emergency medical help right away. Other signs include:Sudden shortness of breathCold sweatsNausea or vomitingLightheadedness or dizzinessExtreme fatigueThese apart, regular check ups are important, especially if you are over 40, and have a history of heart disease in the family. Regular checkups can help to track the warning signs.","Heart blockage occurs when the arteries supplying blood to your heart can get partially or fully blocked (due to the build up of cholesterol) One of the most common warning signs of heart blockage is extreme chest pain or tightness.

4 skin changes that indicate liver disease,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-skin-changes-that-indicate-liver-disease/articleshow/121773322.cms,"Yellowing of the Skin (Jaundice)

Spider Angiomas

Palmar Erythema (Redness of the Palms)

Itching, Often Worse at Night (Pruritus)

The liver is the largest solid organ of the body, performing key functions like filtering blood, processing nutrients, storing energy, and detoxifying harmful substances. While following good habits such as healthy food, limited or no alcohol, and others are key to keeping the liver healthy, sometimes these are not enough. Liver damage is getting increasingly common these days, and encompasses a wide range of conditions that can affect the liver's ability to function properly. This could be due to viral infections, alcohol consumption, genetic conditions, and other factors. Amongst other symptoms, the liver leaves a lasting impact on your skin, and if you notice these signs, it is best to get yourself checked out for onset of liver damage...One of the most well-known signs of liver disease is yellowing of the skin, also called jaundice. This happens because the liver is unable to properly remove a yellow pigment called bilirubin from the blood. Bilirubin is produced when old red blood cells break down.When the liver is damaged, bilirubin builds up in the bloodstream and causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This yellow color is often first seen on the face, hands, and feet.Jaundice is a clear sign that the liver is not functioning well and needs medical attention. Jaundice is also completely reversible, provided it is detected early, and usually has no long term complications.Spider angiomas, also known as spider nevi, are small, red, spider-like blood vessels that appear on the skin. They look like a central red dot with tiny lines spreading out like spider legs. These usually appear on the face, neck, upper chest, and arms.These spots occur because liver disease causes hormone imbalances, especially an increase in estrogen. This hormone causes small blood vessels near the skin to widen and form these spider-like patterns. While spider angiomas themselves are harmless, their presence in large numbers can be a sign of liver problems, especially cirrhosis.Palmar erythema is a condition where the palms of the hands turn red, often symmetrically on both hands. The redness can sometimes feel warm or have a slight burning sensation.This occurs because liver disease causes changes in blood flow and hormone levels, which lead to increased blood circulation in the palms. If you notice persistent redness on your palms without any clear cause like sunburn or irritation, it could be a sign of liver dysfunction, particularly cirrhosis.Itching without any visible rash is a common but often overlooked symptom of liver disease. This itching, called pruritus, can be very uncomfortable and tends to worsen at night.The cause of this itching is the buildup of bile salts in the bloodstream. When the liver is damaged, it cannot properly remove bile, which then deposits in the skin and triggers an inflammatory response. This leads to persistent itching that does not improve with normal skin creams or allergy treatments. If you experience unexplained itching along with other signs, get yourself tested.Liver diseases encompass a wide range of conditions that impair the liver's ability to function, which is crucial for digestion, nutrient processing, and detoxification. Common types include viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E), which cause inflammation and can lead to chronic liver damage; fatty liver disease, both non-alcoholic (often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome) and alcoholic (caused by excessive alcohol consumption); and cirrhosis, a severe scarring of the liver resulting from various chronic liver diseases. Consult a doctor if you notice any of these signs.","Jaundice is a clear sign that the liver is not functioning well and needs medical attention.

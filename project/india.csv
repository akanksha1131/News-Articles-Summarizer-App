Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

NEW DELHI: A weekend party night in North Goa turned into a tragedy after a massive fire tore through a nightclub in Arpora, killing at least 25 people and injuring many more late Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the blaze followed a ""big fire"" triggered by a ""massive explosion,"" in one of Goa's busiest nightlife belts.Local authorities later confirmed that the club structure itself had no valid permissions. A panchayat official from Arpora said the establishment’s construction “was there without permission,” raising serious questions about regulatory oversight.Several visitors described how close they came to being inside when the inferno erupted. Avanish from Delhi, who had planned to visit the restaurant, said, “…Actually, we got lucky because our cab driver was late or else we would be here…”A security guard at a nearby restaurant recalled the moment the blast shook the area: “...We heard a massive explosion. We later learned that the fire broke out after a cylinder blast…”Nikhnesh, also from Delhi, said he arrived just as smoke began rising. “As soon as we reached our hostel, we saw plumes of smoke rising… Actually, we were planning to come and party here last night… I think there was DJ party yesterday, I don’t know much about it.”Witnesses reported that between 100 and 150 people were on the dance floor when the fire broke out. In the panic, several people rushed downstairs into the kitchen area, where they were trapped along with staff members. Most of the victims, authorities said, were kitchen workers; among the dead were three women and several tourists.Sanjay Kumar Gupta, a security guard at Birch, said the tragedy unfolded within minutes. “The incident occurred between 11 pm and 12 am. Suddenly, there was a fire... I was at the gate… A DJ, dancer was going to come here, and it was about to get really crowded…”Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad, said the nightclub was packed for the weekend. “There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting… We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,” she said. Many who fled ran into the kitchen, not knowing it was a dead end. “They (tourists) got trapped there along with other staff… Many managed to run out of the club,” she added.The fire spread rapidly, aided by temporary décor made of palm leaves. Access for fire tenders was severely hindered: the club sits along the Arpora backwaters, reachable only through narrow lanes. Tankers had to be parked almost 400 metres away, slowing the response. A senior Fire and Emergency Services officer said the lack of access “made controlling the blaze a challenging task.” Most deaths occurred due to suffocation.Chief minister Pramod Sawant , who visited the site, said the club had not complied with fire safety norms. He announced an inquiry and assured strict action. “The nightclub had not followed the fire safety norms,” he said, adding that both the management and officials who allowed it to run would face consequences.Arpora-Nagoa panchayat sarpanch Roshan Redkar said the club was operated by Saurav Luthra, who was embroiled in a dispute with his partner. “We had inspected the premises and found that they did not have the permission to construct the club,” he said. A demolition notice had been issued earlier, but officials from the directorate of panchayats granted a stay.“The fire incident that happened was unfortunate… Now, we have to be more vigilant,” Redkar added.Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who also reached the site, said all nightclubs in the area will face a fire safety audit starting Monday. He said notices would be issued seeking valid permissions, and “the licenses of clubs not having the necessary permissions will be cancelled.”","A massive fire tore through a nightclub in North Goa, killing at least 25 people.

May the injured recover at the earliest.” PM Modi added that he had spoken to Goa CM Pramod Sawant and that the state government was providing all possible assistance to those affected.The late-night blaze at Birch by Romeo Lane, a nightclub located around 25 km from Panaji, claimed at least 25 lives and left about 50 injured, officials said. Several of the victims were staff members working at the venue.Goa DGP Alok Kumar told PTI that a cylinder blast inside the establishment, which opened last year, caused the fire.Fire and emergency teams battled the blaze through the night, and the injured were rushed to nearby hospitals.Goa CM Pramod Sawant, who visited the site, termed the incident “unfortunate” and said a detailed probe had been ordered. “The inquiry will examine the exact cause of the fire, and those found responsible will face the most stringent action under the law,” he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi expresses deep grief over the Arpora nightclub fire tragedy in Goa.

NEW DELHI: Taking note of the days-long ordeal faced by passengers due to mass cancellation of IndiGo flights, the parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders, including sector regulator DGCA and officials from aviation ministry. The panel, headed by Sanjay Kumar Jha of JDU, will not only seek explanations but also explore solutions to ensure that such disruptions do not occur again, sources said.TOI learnt that while some panel members themselves faced inconvenience due to sudden flight cancellations, others received calls detailing how the crisis derailed travel plans of thousands of passengers.“This is an unprecedented situation in the history of India’s aviation sector. Both the airlines and the regulator will have to explain why such a situation occurred and why they failed to anticipate it,” said a member of the panel.Another member said the episode has exposed deeper systemic issues of the aviation sector, including manpower shortages, strained crew-management systems and gaps in regulatory oversight. The panel will also discuss how rival airlines ‘increased fares abnormally to make undue profit’.","The parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders.

Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

AGARTALA: The unprecedented flight disruptions across India have extended a family’s wait to give the final farewell to their young son, prolonging their agony. The body of 23-year-old Saptarshi Das from Ramnagar in Agartala has been holed up at a mortuary in Delhi for past three days.Saptarshi, a medical intern at a private hospital in Lucknow, died in a road accident on Delhi-Lucknow national highway on the night of Dec 3. His friends Arnav Chakraborty, Ayush Sharma and Shrestha Pancholi also lost their lives in the accident. Their car overturned after colliding at a high speed with a stationary truck.Following an autopsy, Saptarshi’s body was released to his family for transportation to Agartala for the last rites. However, the sudden cancellation of flights by IndiGo led to a frustrating cycle of returning the body to the mortuary and booking hotel accommodations, while scouting for alternative options.Saptarshi’s mother Arpita Debsarkar said her family was repeatedly promised about flights, only to discover they had been cancelled at the last moment, and had to navigate back and forth between the mortuary, hotel & airport. Saptarshi was nearing the completion of his MBBS internship at Venkateshwar Medical University, with just three months left, his mother said.Chaos still persists at Agartala’s Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport as a result of the flight disruptions. In past two days alone, three flights per day have been cancelled, leaving hundreds of passengers, including patients, stranded at the airport lounge. Frustrated travellers have accused both IndiGo and Airports Authority of India of failing to fulfil their obligations.","The body of 23-year-old Saptarshi Das from Ramnagar in Agartala has been holed up at a mortuary in Delhi for past three days.

Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

MUMBAI: An Embraer E175LR private jet was rushed to Guwahati on Saturday to bring back 36 children of top corporate executives after they were stranded in Kaziranga when IndiGo cancelled its flights. The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in India as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.“Typical movements included Delhi-Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, all popular wedding destinations, apart from Hyderabad and Chennai,” said Gautam Sahni of Noida-based Subha Aviation, which specialises in airline charters. He described the spike as “unprecedented”, driven entirely by destination wedding groups and smaller groups of 50-180 whose scheduled flights were cancelled at short notice: “Look for 50-seater airline jets and you will find that nothing is available in the market today because, ultimately, you have to take aircraft away from a scheduled carrier’s flow. ”“Every airline does charters, but none can support this kind of sudden demand, especially at a time their scheduled flights are flying packed because of IndiGo disruptions,” he said.In one instance, he added, an eight-seater aircraft had to be flown empty from Delhi to Kolkata to pick up a wedding party after their airline connection broke down.Mandar Bharde, of Mumbai-based MAB Aviation, said past four days had brought a flood of enquiries, led largely by destination weddings and year-end travel.“Every day we are getting requests from destination wedding hosts in Jaipur and Udaipur. Dec is peak vacation season and all charter flights are full,” he said. Bharde added that Mumbai has about 8-10 charter aircraft while Delhi has about 20, but most operators were already busy before the airline disruptions worsened the crunch.Rahul Muchhal, of Accretion Aviation, said: “We’ve been getting 200-250 calls daily over the past three days, not much from Mumbai, and mostly for Delhi-Goa, Delhi-Udaipur and Mumbai-Delhi. But today, nothing is available. The actual bookings were mainly from corporate houses who needed to shift people urgently.”So, how much do these charters cost? A 30-seater Delhi-Udaipur charter was quoted at about Rs 17.6 lakh plus taxes, touching Rs 20 lakh all-inclusive; the operator did not divulge the aircraft type. Smaller aircraft such as the 7-seater King Air B200 on the Delhi-Vadodara sector cost Rs 11 lakh for a round trip. Aircraft type also dictates the price.A 13-seater Embraer Legacy aircraft cost Rs 20 lakh to charter, including 18% GST, and a 7-seater Bombardier Learjet went for Rs 18-19 lakh.","The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in India as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.

NEW DELHI: An ambitious campaign that began on Sept 13 will reach its grand finale on Dec 8 at a glittering ‘Ideas for India’ summit, where some of the finest minds in the country — ranging across diverse sectors like business, tech, policy, and academia — will assemble to brainstorm innovations that could transform the nation, and 12 winners whose ideas were chosen after a gruelling selection process will be felicitated. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be the chief guest and deliver the keynote address.The Times of India launched the Ideas for India initiative as a powerful thought-leadership platform, recognising that achieving the national vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047 requires not just economic momentum, but a fundamental reimagining of solutions. The campaign was conceived with the core belief that answers to India’s greatest challenges lie within its people.The initiative has tapped the country’s innovative energy, drawing thousands of registrations from students, entrepreneurs and change-makers across India. At its heart is a nationwide Innovation Challenge that moves beyond speeches and slogans to focus on actionable blueprints.Participants were invited to submit solutions across three critical pillars – Make in India for the World, Environmental Sustainability, and Health & Social Wellbeing – with a focus on scalability, feasibility and impact.The promise is clear: your idea today can contribute to India’s progress tomorrow, provided it can be executed on the ground and deliver measurable change.Entries were expected to address real-world gaps, from inclusive industrial growth and skilling to clean energy, water security, mental health, digital inclusion and social equity.The Innovation Challenge cast its net wide across emerging and priority sectors such as green and renewable energy, healthcare and health tech, advanced manufacturing, cyber security and digital public infrastructure, agri-tech, urban mobility, water and climate resilience, waste management and circular economy, logistics, and education and skilling.To ensure rigour and transparency, the process was structured as an end-to-end framework. After a national call for entries through a dedicated microsite, TechGig conducted the first-level screening, with EY validating the scoring and shortlisting. A 28-member screening jury of entrepreneurs, CXOs, marketing and tech leaders then helped narrow the list down to 67 submissions, from which 34 finalists emerged.Shortlisted participants were tasked with building first-cut prototypes and received one-on-one mentorship from a panel of five experts in early Dec. Their refined solutions were then presented before a Grand Jury of senior industry leaders and policy voices, split across two groups to evaluate categories such as Economic Resilience, Environment & Sustainability, and Health & Social across tech and non-tech streams.The journey now culminates in a National Summit, where around 30 of the most promising innovators will present their ideas and prototypes to policymakers, experts and industry leaders, and 12 winners will finally be chosen. A dedicated compendium will capture the 30 blueprints that made it to the finals — ideas that not only stood up to rigorous evaluation, but can also serve as potential building blocks for the Viksit Bharat that India envisions in 2047.",The Times of India launched the Ideas for India initiative as a powerful thought-leadership platform.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials

Why wasn’t Sweety, deported with Sunali, brought back: Kin

KOLKATA: Tears of relief flowed in one mud-walled home in Bengal’s Birbhum district. A kilometre away, another house filled with the same prayers stayed silent.On Saturday, Sunali Khatun returned to Paikar village with her son Shabir, 8, after months of detention in Bangladesh. Her return, ordered on humanitarian grounds because of her advanced pregnancy, has only sharpened the anguish of another Birbhum family still waiting for their daughter, Sweety Bibi, and her two sons to come back.Sweety’s third child Imran, who lives with his grandparents, keeps asking why his aunt has returned but not his mother. “How do you explain this to a 10-year-old?” said Sweety’s mother Rozina Bibi, 50. “They took my mother,” Imran said. “When will they return her to me?”The family’s struggle runs deeper. Sweety has been the sole earner since her husband Azizul Dewan went missing in TN four years ago. Working as a house help in Delhi, she supported her three sons and her ailing parents. “We cry every time we meet,” Rozina said of Sunali’s parents Bhodu and Jyotsna. “Today their daughter is back. We are happy for them. But why not mine?”Sunali, her husband Danish Sheikh, their son, and her cousin Sweety, 32, along with Sweety’s two sons — Kurban, 16, and Imam, 6 — were picked up in June during a crackdown on “illegal immigrants” in New Delhi. They were flown to Guwahati and pushed across the border under an order of Delhi’s Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Bangladesh authorities arrested them on Aug 21. A Chapai Nawabganj court later granted them bail.A Calcutta high court division bench had quashed the deportation order, citing procedural lapses, and directed that all six be brought home. That judgment was challenged before the Supreme Court, where a two-judge bench asked the Centre on Dec 3 to bring back Sunali and her son and keep her under hospital care.“If the HC ordered all six to be brought back, why was my daughter stopped?” asked Rozina. “They told us she reached the border, then said it would take two or three more days. We have been hearing this since Sept 26.”Bengal migrant workers’ welfare board chairperson Samirul Islam said Supreme Court will hear Sweety’s case again on Dec 12. “We are hopeful that Sweety and her two minor children, and Sunali’s husband, will be allowed to return too,” he said. Until then, one Birbhum household rocks a pregnant daughter back into safety. Another counts the footsteps that still haven’t crossed the border.","Sunali Khatun returned to Paikar village with her son Shabir, 8, after months of detention in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While there has been a slight improvement compared to recent weeks, many parts of the city remained shrouded in dense haze.Areas including Ghazipur Mandi, Anand Vihar, and Wazirpur experienced severely reduced visibility due to the smog. CPCB data showed Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 366, Sonia Vihar 352, Wazirpur 359, and Ghazipur Mandi 366, all in the ‘very poor’ range. Bawana recorded the highest AQI at 375 at 7 am, while NSIT Dwarka measured 260, categorised as ‘poor’.The India Gate and Kartavya Path areas were also covered in smog, with the AQI in the region at 311, falling under the ‘very poor’ category.According to the AQI scale, 0–50 is ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.In response to the worsening air quality, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a statement on Friday following a question raised by MP Dr.Laxmikant Bajpayee in the Rajya Sabha. He had asked whether it was true that “one in every seven deaths in Delhi can be attributed to the city’s toxic air as claimed by several studies and reported in the media.”Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh replied that various studies have been conducted by academic and research institutes on the impact of air pollution. He added that in 2025, the AQI in Delhi had not reached the ‘severe plus’ level on any day.The government continues to take measures to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), established under the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, oversees air quality in Delhi and neighbouring regions.The Commission has been working collaboratively with all major stakeholders to reduce pollution. It has issued 95 statutory directions to guide action against air pollution and has prepared a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage pollution during peak winter months. Stricter emission norms for polluting activities in the NCR have also been implemented, and regular review meetings are held to monitor progress.","A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am.

Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

BJP hits back

.

(with inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said that the opposition INDIA alliance is currently “on life support”. He said that internal infighting is weakening its ability to challenge the BJP Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in New Delhi, Abdullah said the opposition bloc is struggling to function as a united force against the ruling party’s strong election machinery.“We’re sort of on life support, but every once in a while somebody brings out his paddles and gives us a bit of a shock and we get up again. But then results like Bihar happen, and we slump down again, and then somebody has to wheel us into the ICU,” the National Conference leader said.Referring to the recent election results in Bihar, where the INDIA alliance suffered a massive defeat against the NDA, he blamed the opposition bloc for driving Nitish Kumar back into the ruling alliance.“I believe that we pushed Nitish Kumar back into the arms of the NDA,” he said.He also pointed to organisational failures within the INDIA bloc, including the decision to exclude the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) from the Bihar seat-sharing arrangement, despite the party's presence in the state.According to Abdullah, the alliance has failed to take cohesive and strategic decisions.He said the BJP begins preparing for the next election almost immediately after one ends, while the opposition often starts its preparations only months before polls, sometimes finalising alliances just before the last date for filing nominations.When asked if the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was a fluke, Abdullah rejected the suggestion. “No, I think the country sent a message to the Central government and to Prime Minister Modi in 2024 that things are not as rosy as they were made out to be,” he said.He also said that after the 2024 elections, the Centre showed that it can work in an alliance format. “From calling it a BJP government, they called themselves an NDA government. These are small changes, but they matter,” Abdullah said. He added that the government’s style of functioning has become more consultative.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, reacting to Abdullah’s remarks said that he had “shown a mirror” to the INDIA alliance.In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote: “Omar Abdullah shows a mirror to INDI.”He added that the INDI alliance, led by the Congress, pushed Nitish Kumar out, gave an “unfair deal” to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Bihar.""INDI alliance ( read Congress ) pushed out Nitish Kumar ji. INDI alliance gave unfair deal to JMM in Bihar so if they leave don’t be surprised,"" his post read.Poonawalla further said that the NDA is a “Majboot alliance” with a clear mission and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its leader and called Congress a “Majboor alliance of ambition and corruption”.""NDA is Majboot alliance full of mission & vision with Modi ji as leader. Indi is Majboor alliance of ambition and corruption with Rahul Baba at helm,"" he wrote.Poonawalla also said that Abdullah’s party has earlier taken positions different from other INDIA bloc partners, including on issues related to alleged “vote chori”.",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said that the opposition INDIA alliance is currently “on life support” He said that internal infighting is weakening its ability to challenge the BJP.

Cabbies double fares; pvt bus operators come to rescue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabbies-double-fares-pvt-bus-operators-come-to-rescue/articleshow/125798323.cms,"Chandigarh/Nagpur: With major flight disruptions continuing for the third consecutive day, taxi operators in Chandigarh are driving away with the moolah. All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000. Fares on Nagpur-Bengaluru route showed a hike, but there seemed to be little to no inflation for other destinations like Pune and Hyderabad.","All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues' Many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - had to book last-minute taxis.

Right to Disconnect Bill 2025: Supriya Sule moves legislation to promote work-life balance for employees after office hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supriya-sule-moves-bill-to-ensure-right-to-disconnect-after-office-hours/articleshow/125803345.cms,"Supriya Sule (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Bhim Singh introduced a Private Member's Bill in the Upper House seeking to remove the words 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Constitution's Preamble, on Saturday.The MP said these terms were added 'undemocratically' during the Emergency in 1976 through the 42nd amendment under Indira Gandhi's government, when opposition leaders were imprisoned.Singh introduced The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the Rajya Sabha, arguing these words were not part of the original Constitution adopted in 1949.""I have introduced a Private Member's Bill to amend the Preamble of the Constitution, to remove the words 'socialist' and 'secular'. The original Constitution, adopted in 1949, which has been in force since 1950, did not have these two words. Mrs Indira Gandhi added these two words to the Constitution during the Emergency in 1976, under the 42nd Constitution amendment. At that time, no debate was held in Parliament,"" Singh told PTI.""All the opposition leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and George Fernandes were in jail.Democracy was being murdered, and in that situation, Mrs Indira Gandhi added these two words. So, this is the word that was added later, and the Constitution should remain in its original form,"" he added.Singh referenced debates from the Constituent Assembly where Dr BR Ambedkar had addressed these terms. ""The chairman of the Drafting Committee, Dr B R Ambedkar, answered. He said the structure of the Constitution of India is such that it will make the country secular. He said it (inclusion of the word) is not needed,"" Singh said.""There was a debate on the word socialist as well. Ambedkar replied that the Constitution committee cannot force future generations to follow the same political and economic policy. As far as socialism is concerned, it is related to the welfare of the people. This has been factored into the Constitution,"" he said.""Was India secular before 1976 or not?

"After 10-yr chase, wildlife sleuths nab the ‘ghost’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-10-yr-chase-wildlife-sleuths-nab-the-ghost/articleshow/125795175.cms,"Woman Behind Massive Trafficking Network Finally Runs Out Of Luck In Snowbound Village On China Border

BHOPAL: In the snowbound silence of Lachung, in north Sikkim, 43-year-old wildlife trafficker Yangchen Lachungpa, wanted by Interpol, finally ran out of mountains.For 10 years, agencies across India and abroad had hunted for Yangchen — a woman who, investigators said, moved like a ghost, slipping across borders, abandoning safe houses hours ahead of raids, and allegedly built trafficking corridors that linked Madhya Pradesh’s tiger reserves to Nepal, Tibet and China.But on Dec 2, in a tiny Himalayan village just a few km from the India-China border, the chase ended in a way even veteran officers described as “like watching a film play out in real time”.As radios died and torches dimmed in the freezing darkness, the MP State Tiger Strike Force (STSF) and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) team found itself under jurisdiction of the Dzumsa, Lachung’s centuries-old self-governing council. Villagers reportedly blocked the only exit, and elected headmen demanded documents. And the officers — carrying warrants for one of the world’s most elusive wildlife traffickers — were forced to defend every procedural step before being allowed to detain Yangchen.At the centre of this standoff sat the woman they had chased for a decade — Yangchen Lachungpa, also the former wife of 44-year-old Jaiy Tamang, arrested from Delhi for his alleged role in smuggling pangolin scales.Tamang’s confession years earlier had first exposed Yangchen as a critical architect of the smuggling chain.Officers said Yangchen allegedly tried to destroy two cellphones and a coded diary containing names, routes and hawala references before the arrest could be completed. “It was part standoff, part village trial, part global crime bust. We had an Interpol fugitive sitting in front of us, but first, we had to convince a 400-year-old council that Indian law applied,” said an investigator.Her eventual arrest came only after months of technical surveillance, decoy movements and night-time encirclements across high-altitude terrain. The operation was monitored closely by Madhya Pradesh govt, officials said, given the seriousness of the tiger-poaching case.Yangchen’s arrest marks one of India’s most significant breakthroughs in wildlife enforcement — and one of the rare arrests executed following an Interpol Red Notice, issued on Oct 2, 2025, at India’s request. It allowed law enforcement in 195 countries to detain her if found.Originally from Tibet, Yangchen allegedly built trafficking corridors that funnelled tiger parts, pangolin scales, red sanders, shatoosh wool and Cordyceps to international buyers. She frequently moved between Delhi and remote Sikkim hideouts, often vanishing just before surveillance teams closed in.The role of this syndicate surfaced repeatedly in international seizures. In 2013, Nepal Police intercepted five tiger skins and seven sacks of bones en route to Tibet; DNA testing later matched one hide to Pench tigress T-13. In 2015, Ethiopian authorities confiscated eight tiger skins believed to have originated in central India. Both cases, investigators said, bore the hallmark of the alleged network Yangchen helped create.The case that finally cornered her began in July 2015, when MP authorities seized tiger bones, skin, pangolin scales and bone oil extract from Satpura Tiger Reserve. STSF uncovered what officials called a “highly structured multinational trafficking chain.” As many as 31 accused were arrested, and 27 were convicted by a Narmadapuram court in 2022. But Yangchen, the woman believed to be the missing link — the one connecting village-level poachers to buyers beyond the Himalayas — remained out of reach.She was arrested once in Sept 2017, but went on the run after obtaining interim bail. In 2019, her anticipatory bail was rejected, and she disappeared again, prompting authorities to seek international intervention.After her arrest in Lachung, Yangchen was transported to Gangtok for medical examination and produced in court on Dec 3, where MP authorities secured transit remand. Sikkim Police provided vital support in what officers called “one of the most culturally delicate and operationally dangerous extractions in recent memory”.Payments in the network were allegedly routed through Kathmandu, Siliguri and border villages, while suspected wildlife stockpiles were maintained in Satpura, Pench, Betul and Tamia forests. The coded diary recovered in the raid is expected to reveal financial backers, international contacts and the deeper structure of the trafficking chain.A senior enforcement officer said the breakthrough “finally gives sleuths a chance to expose the top tier of global wildlife contraband markets”, adding that more arrests across states — and potentially across borders — are likely.","Yangchen Lachungpa, 43, wanted by Interpol, finally ran out of mountains.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Calcutta HC directed the Bengal govt Friday to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad’s Beldanga ahead of suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir ’s planned foundation-laying ceremony for a “Babri Masjid”, coinciding with the Dec 6 anniversary of the Ayodhya structure’s 1992 demolition.“The state must act per its stand... The law-and-order situation in Murshidabad shall be strictly maintained, and the lives and properties of citizens will be protected,” the division bench of acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice Partha Sarathi Sen said while disposing of a PIL against the scheduled event.Kabir’s mosque plan comes barely eight months after communal violence in Murshidabad, triggered by protests against the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 2025.Advocate-general Kishore Datta told the bench the state had already deployed adequate forces to thwart any plan to disturb peace. Deputy solicitor-general Rajdeep Majumdar said 19 companies of CISF were stationed in the area. A 3,500-strong security contingent, including RAF units, fanned out into Rejinagar and its surrounding areas on the eve of the event. Two BSF companies are on standby to secure NH-12.MLA Kabir, suspended by TMC a day ago, was summoned to Rejinagar police station Friday evening and questioned for several hours, sources said.Earlier in the day, a defiant Kabir supervised arrangements for Saturday’s event and asked his team to arrange 30,000 packets of biryani for his guests. He met splinter groups of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and All Bengal Imam Muezzin Association.“The main programme will start at noon. The Quran will be read for two hours. There will be no speeches, no political representation, no party flags, and no political canards. I will be there with 2,000 volunteers.

'We are sorry': IndiGo

Operations slowly returning to normal



NEW DELHI: IndiGo’s flight chaos deepened on Saturday, with the airline scrapping more than 400 flights across four major airports, even after it secured temporary relief from the new court-ordered pilot duty and rest rules just a day earlier, PTI news agency quoted sources.Of these cancellations, Bengaluru airport accounted for 124 flights—63 departures and 61 arrivals—while Mumbai saw 109 cancellations, including 51 departures and 58 arrivals. Delhi airport reported 106 cancellations, with 54 departures and 52 arrivals affected. In Hyderabad, IndiGo cancelled 66 flights, the PTI sources added.The disruptions, which began earlier this week, have continued due to pilot-rostering problems, leading to widespread cancellations across the country.The ministry issued statement, ""Ministry of civil aviation has taken serious note of concerns regarding unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption. In order to protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing, the Ministry has invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes.An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to the fare caps that have now been prescribed.These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. The objective of this directive is to maintain pricing discipline in the market, prevent any exploitation of passengers in distress, and ensure that citizens who urgently need to travel — including senior citizens, students, and patients — are not subjected to financial hardship during this period. ""More than 200 flights were cancelled on Saturday from just two major cities—Delhi and Mumbai—a day after airlines received temporary relaxations in the second phase of the court-mandated flight duty and rest rules for pilots, sources said.According to officials, Mumbai saw 109 IndiGo cancellations, including 51 arrivals and 58 departures. At Delhi airport, 106 IndiGo flights were cancelled, with 54 departures and 52 arrivals affected.Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu on Friday said that the government will not ignore the massive disruptions faced by IndiGo airlines, stressing that ""this thing shouldn't be left unattended"".He said a committee has been formed to investigate the issue and necessary action will be taken against those responsible.Speaking about the situation, the minister said, ""The immediate priority for us is to bring back normalcy and provide all the support to the passengers.""He also added that the ministry is closely monitoring all operational aspects. ""We are deeply observing this, and observing the FDTL norms, scheduling network. We will thoroughly look into this and ensure that all airlines follow due diligence.""The minister further confirmed that a formal probe has been launched. ""We have formed a committee which will inquire into all this so that they can establish where things went wrong and who did it wrong. We are going to take necessary action on that also. This thing shouldn't be left unattended. We are taking strict action on this, so that whoever was responsible into this needs to pay for it.""On Saturday morning, Thiruvananthapuram airport reported six cancellations -- three arrivals and three departures. In Ahmedabad, seven arrivals and 12 departures were cancelled.At Mumbai airport, passengers remained stranded as IndiGo struggled to stabilise operations. Long queues were also seen at Chennai airport, where several flights were cancelled.14 arrivals and 28 departures of IndiGo cancelled at Pune Airport on Saturday.IndiGo, which usually handles about two-thirds of India’s domestic air traffic and operates around 2,300 flights daily, cancelled more than 1,000 flights on Friday alone as crew shortages continued.Aviation regulator DGCA issued new orders on Friday to help stabilise the situation. The authority granted exemptions in Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) and other relaxations so IndiGo can deploy more pilots and reduce delays.The DGCA said the exemptions were aimed at restoring normal operations “at the earliest.”The airline apologised on X, saying it would automatically process refunds and provide full waivers for cancellations or rescheduling for travel between December 5 and December 15, 2025.The airline added, ""Kindly check the flight status on our website and the notifications sent to you. Please do not come to the airport if your flight is cancelled...""IndiGo assured passengers of multiple support measures, stating, ""We will ensure that all refunds for your cancellations will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment.

NEW DELHI: Infertility treatment in India is driving an overwhelming financial crisis for families, with a new multi-centre study showing that nearly 90% of couples undergoing IVF are pushed into catastrophic expenditure—even in public hospitals. The analysis, conducted across five major institutions, highlights the scale of the burden at a time when infertility affects an estimated 3.9–16.8% of Indian couples.The study found that out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for one IVF cycle averages Rs 1.1 lakh in public hospitals and Rs 2.30 lakh in private hospitals, forcing more than half of couples to borrow money. Only 5% had any insurance coverage for IVF, and those who did received limited support. Researchers also estimated the health-system cost of one IVF cycle at Rs 81,332, irrespective of hospital efficiency.Based on this, the study recommends that Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) consider adopting Rs 81,332 as the reimbursement package rate if IVF is added to the scheme.The study was conducted by the HTA Resource Hub at the Indian Council of Medical Research–National Institute for Research in Reproductive and Child Health (ICMR-NIRRCH), led by Principal Investigator Dr Beena Joshi.The financial strain extends beyond IVF. Among couples undergoing infertility treatment for conditions such as PCOS, endometriosis, tubal disease or male-factor infertility, 25% experienced catastrophic expenditure. The median OOPE for non-IVF infertility treatment was Rs 11,317, with private hospitals leading to higher medical costs, while public facilities imposed higher indirect and non-medical expenses.Quality of life was markedly poorer among couples seeking treatment, especially those undergoing IVF. Women reported significant pain, anxiety and depression, while men showed increased anxiety scores.The study was conducted across PGIMER Chandigarh, SRIHER Chennai, Maulana Azad Medical College (Delhi), SAT Hospital at Government Medical College Trivandrum, and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Wardha. It assessed 30 IVF patients and 100 infertility patients at each site, along with detailed costing from hospital records.Among IVF couples, oligospermia and tubal-factor infertility were the leading causes, while among non-IVF groups, PCOS was the most common diagnosis.The researchers note that because most infertility expenses fall under OPD care, PM-JAY would need to revise its current structure—which excludes OPD costs—to make IVF coverage meaningful. They also suggest that, in line with earlier CGHS norms and NICE guidelines, up to three IVF cycles could be considered for reimbursement.","Infertility affects an estimated 3.9–16.8% of Indian couples.

NEW DELHI: While continuing its defiance of orders from Madras HC allowing lighting of the ‘ Karthigai Deepam ’ atop Thiruparankundram hills, Tamil Nadu’s DMK govt on Friday requested Supreme Court for an early hearing on its appeal but got no such assurance from CJI Surya Kant.When a counsel mentioned TN’s appeal before a bench of CJI Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, referring it to as an issue of “lighting of a lamp on a hilltop” and urging for an urgent hearing, the CJI said he would consider its listing as soon as possible. The state govt defended its action of not complying with the HC orders allowing the traditional lighting of ‘deepam’ at the stone lamp pillar on the Thirupparankundram hillock near Madurai on the ground that legally it had exclusive rights over rituals and customs of Uchi Pillayar temple.HC had allowed the ‘deepam’, saying it would not encroach the rights of the adjacent dargah. The order passed by a single-judge bench was upheld by a division bench.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran said that on the one hand, TN is repeatedly defying the HC’s orders, and on the other, it is “creating a drama” by filing an appeal in SC to dissuade HC from proceeding with the contempt proceedings initiated against authorities for blatant, brazen and deliberate defiance of HC’s orders.In its appeal in SC, the MK Stalin-led DMK govt said HC cannot use its “contempt jurisdiction” to question temple rituals and customs, which are within the exclusive domain of authorities under TN Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act, 1959.The single-judge bench on Wednesday initiated contempt proceedings against officials after the ‘deepam’ was lit at the temple, not at the ‘deepathoon’ atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1. TN’s appeal against this order was dismissed by the division bench.The DMK govt in its appeal in SC said the temple’s management, including the area under ‘deepathoon’ was under its exclusive control, and that it had passed prohibitory orders to ensure safety of citizens and take care of possible law and order situations. “The impugned judgment (of HC) raises important questions regarding the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management under statutory schemes, the effect of prior civil decrees and writ precedents, and the interface between judicial orders and executive law and order measures,” it said.The appeal detailed the tussle between HC and authorities. HC’s single-judge bench at 6.05pm on Dec 3 ordered authorities to allow the petitioner to go to the hilltop to light the lamp, and around the same time, the district collector issued prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the BNSS (Section 144 of CrPC) prohibiting persons from climbing the hillock to prevent a law and order situation.The division bench, while dismissing the state’s appeal, had said the executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions, and noted apparent manipulation/timing of prohibitory orders. It said the appeal was a “well-designed act” to pre-empt contempt. It said the single-judge would decide whether the non-compliance of its orders was wilful.",Madras HC had allowed lighting of the ‘ Karthigai Deepam ’ atop Thiruparankundram hills.

PM Modi Bats For Peaceful Resolution To Ukraine Conflict

'Like Pole Star': PM Modi Lauds Strong Ties With Russia; Hails Moscow's Support In War On Terror

Relationship built on trust has stood test of time: PM

NEW DELHI: Amidst the turbulence the world has witnessed in the past 8 decades, the India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole or a guiding star resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Narendra Modi as both sides reaffirmed their commitment to upgrading the economic partnership in the summit with President Vladimir Putin.The 2 countries signed over a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in areas like health, migration and maritime cooperation, and adopted a framework for economic cooperation that is expected to boost trade to $ 100 billion in the next 5 years, as Putin said that Russia is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy.Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India's energy, said Putin while hailing India’s “independent and self-sufficient"" foreign policy. The Indian side maintained its energy partners, whether old or new, understood the need for diversification given its focus on securing its energy interests and the need to maintain stability in oil prices.While there was a “general discussion” on defence including the Make-in-India initiative and legacy cooperation, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the focus in the summit was mainly on economic cooperation and efforts to ensure balanced and sustainable trade by facilitating more Indian exports to Russia.Both leaders also strongly backed ongoing efforts for early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. Modi underlined the significance of civil nuclear cooperation, saying energy security has been a strong and vital pillar of the India-Russia partnership.“Over the past eight decades, the world has witnessed many ups and downs. Humanity has faced numerous challenges and crises. Yet, through all of this, the India-Russia friendship has remained steady like a guiding star. Built on mutual respect and deep trust, our relationship has stood the test of time,” said Modi, adding that the new economic cooperation programme till 2030 will make trade and investment more diversified and balanced. He said cooperation in critical minerals is vital for ensuring secure and diversified supply chains across the world.India announced a free 30-day e-Tourist Visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizens. The manpower mobility agreement will create new strength and new opportunities for both countries, said Modi, who also raised the need for early release of Indians serving in the Russian army with Putin.According to a joint statement - as both sides called for comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary global realities and to make it more representative, effective and efficient in dealing with issues of international peace and security - Russia reiterated its steadfast support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed Council.Putin also said that Russia and India are conducting independent foreign policy together with the like-minded countries in BRICS and SCO and promoting a more “just and democratic multipolar world order”.“We are defending the main principles of the international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Among them, the right of any country for its own way of development and the preservation of their cultural civilizational identity, respect for sovereignty, careful balance of interests of all participants of the world community,” said Putin.On defence cooperation, the joint statement said that responding to India’s quest for self-reliance, the partnership is reorienting presently to joint research and development, co-development and co-production of advanced defence technology and systems. “Our country for the last half a century has been helping to arm and modernize the Indian army, including the air defense forces, aviation, and the navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiations we just had,” said Putin in his media statement after the meeting.On international issues, the leaders endorsed their cooperation in keeping Afghanistan free of terrorism and stressed the importance of resolving the Iran nuclear issue through dialogue. They also expressed concern, according to the joint statement, over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and strongly stressed the importance for all parties concerned to remain committed to agreements and understandings reached between them for cessation of conflict, humanitarian assistance and a sustainable peace.","India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole or a guiding star resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Narendra Modi.

Exemptions will put safety at risk, says pilots’ body

NEW DELHI: Govt has put on hold the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms for pilots with “immediate effect for now” and expects normalcy in IndiGo operations to be restored by Dec 15.The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi, wreaking havoc on plans of lakhs of fliers. IndiGo is offering full waiver on cancellation /reschedule requests on travel from Dec 5 to 15. On Saturday, less than 1,000 flights are likely to be cancelled. The number will gradually fall.On Thursday — when its on-time performance touched its nadir at 8.5% — IndiGo had sought exemption from certain norms, such as the cap on number of night landings a pilot can make between midnight and 6am, to restore normalcy in Airbus A320 operations by Feb 10, 2026. Since that was a long way off, govt put Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s FDTL orders in abeyance.The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline. In past one week, the stock has fallen nearly 9% to Rs 5,371 on BSE at Friday’s close with the airlines major’s current market cap at nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore now.From its Nov 28 close at Rs 5,904 on BSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs 5,266 during Friday’s session. However, after DGCA allowed the airlines some temporary leeway with crew management rules, the stock recovered some ground to close at Rs 5,371, market players said.While IndiGo’s stock suffered due to the ongoing crisis, the stock price of SpiceJet, one of its smaller competitors, gained. Friday SpiceJet stock price rallied 2.5% on BSE to close at Rs 31.Putting on hold Friday its orders meant to ensure that pilots are not fatigued, thereby boosting flight safety, govt said the move will not compromise on safety of passengers. “This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.DGCA has constituted a four-member committee headed by a joint DG for a “comprehensive review and assessment of circumstances leading to operational disruption of IndiGo. Committee will identify accountabilities for failure and adequacy of subsequent mitigation measures being taken by IndiGo,” a govt statement said.Aviation authorities say all possible steps are being taken to stabilise IndiGo operations at the earliest. DGCA has offered its Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to operate flights for IndiGo in an attempt to help the airline recover from its lowest operational point in over 19 years of existence. “FOIs operate a flight every month (to keep their licences valid). We have made this offer to IndiGo, they did not ask for it, to help it get back on its feet as quickly as possible,” said sources.A significant number of pilots for IndiGo and for some other Indian carriers are upset at losing their hard-earned right to a more humane roster. “Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us,” said many senior pilots.Sensing the simmering discontent, Naidu held meetings over video links with some pilot bodies and assured them that the exemption from the new FDTL was temporary. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai issued an appeal to pilots’ associations as the aviation sector is under “significant stress”.“As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India,” Ahmed’s letter says.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video statement saying normalcy could return between Dec 10 and 15, while admitting the crisis had “shaken customers’ belief in IndiGo’s reliability, built over the last 19 years”.Hours after govt relaxed key provisions of the new duty-and-rest norms to help IndiGo stabilise its pilot roster and flight operations, the Indian pilot community criticised the civil aviation regulator, demanding that the said dispensations be withdrawn immediately.The relaxations now allow IndiGo to roster its pilots for longer duty hours than permitted under Phase II of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which came into effect on Nov 1 after a preparatory period of about two years. FDTL norms are mandatory regulatory limits that define the maximum duty hours and minimum rest periods that should be factored in when rostering pilots for duty so as to keep crew fatigue under check and maintain operational safety. Each country formulates its own FDTL based on specific operational realities and scientific studies.In a strongly worded letter to DGCA, Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said selective exemptions compromise safety and undermine the intent of the rules. The union also sought a probe into what it termed an “artificial pilot-shortage narrative” created by IndiGo, punitive action against the airline’s accountable management, and full enforcement of Phase II of the FDTL without exemptions. Airlines in India adopted Phase II of FDTL on Nov 1.The dispensations have destroyed regulatory parity, undermined public trust in DGCA’s neutrality, compromised scientifically established fatigue protections, and placed millions of passengers at heightened risk, said ALPA. Aviation safety expert Capt Amit Singh said the changes bypass the established procedure for exemptions. “These are ad hoc changes. There was no pilot representation before these changes were made,” he said, adding that exemptions must follow safety risk assessments in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation norms.Meanwhile, ALPA’s strongest objection pertained to changes in night operations; relaxation of the definition of night (midnight to 5am was extended in the new FDTL to midnight to 6am) and doubling of permitted landings “encroaching night” — the return to the 5am definition means that a pilot rostered for, say, 5.30am, will not be considered as flying night operations — from two to four, contradicting the revised FDTL and “fundamentally diluting” fatigue protections.DGCA has effectively acknowledged that IndiGo pilots will now fly with reduced rest and increased fatigue, placing passengers at higher risk, it said. It referred to a Nov 24 meeting ALPA had with DGCA in which it was “unequivocally agreed” that no dispensation, exemption or variation, especially for commercial reasons, would be granted to any operator. “FDTL norms exist solely to safeguard human life, and any dilution would expose pilots, passengers, and aircraft to unacceptable risks,” it said.The association questioned why widespread disruptions surfaced 35 days after Phase II came into force: IndiGo had nearly two years to prepare for the Nov 1 implementation of Phase II of revised duty and rest rules for pilot rostering. “These events raise serious concerns that an artificial crisis was engineered to exert pressure on govt for commercial gain under the pretext of public inconvenience.”ALPA warned that if the dispensations are not revoked, DGCA, and not pilots, must bear responsibility for any fatigue-related incident arising from the relaxations.","The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi.

Prosecution failed to prove girl was under age of 18: Judge

MUMBAI: After spending eight years in jail on charges of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old intellectually disabled girl, a 56-year-old driver was recently acquitted by a special Pocso court.The prosecution failed to prove the “basic foundational facts” of the case, highlighting major inconsistencies regarding the girl’s age, her mental capacity, and a significant contradiction between her statements and the medical report. “To my mind, evidence adduced by the prosecution is scanty and not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. If it were so, to my mind, the accused is entitled to get the benefit of doubt,” Special Judge ND Khose said.Advocates Kalam Shaikh and Vaishali Sawant, who defended the accused, submitted that he was falsely implicated due to a past conflict between the girl’s family and him.“No documentary evidence is placed on record showing that the victim is abnormal. Medical evidence is also not supporting the case of the prosecution,” the advocates submitted.The FIR was lodged on Aug 24, 2017. The prosecution alleged that the incident occurred on Aug 23, 2017, between 8 pm and 8.30pm in a slum area.The mother of the girl claimed that while she was at the market and her sons were out, the accused, a neighbour, entered their house. The girl, allegedly a child of 17 years with “less understanding”, later told her mother that the accused had kissed her and established physical relations.The judge noted that the prosecution failed to provide “clinching, believable and authentic documentary evidence” to prove she was under 18. “To my mind, the (birth) certificate… cannot be said to be useful to the prosecution for several reasons... Not only that, from the certificate… it reveals that the names of the father and mother of the girl are not mentioned as mentioned in a report... As such, to my mind, it can be said that no plausible documentary evidence is placed on record by the prosecution to prove the exact age of the girl on the alleged date of the incident. ”The judge said while the FIR suggested the year of birth was 2000, the school certificate indicated 2002. While the prosecution attempted to prove the girl had an IQ of 36, the judge found this claim unproven.","Prosecution failed to prove girl was under age of 18: Judge ND Khose.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials

Unreasonable for nations to expect say in our foreign ties: EAM

NEW DELHI: Amid calls by Bangladesh for ex-PM Sheikh Hasina ’s extradition, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said Saturday her stay in India is her personal decision influenced by what transpired in the country last year.India has so far not acceded to Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of Hasina, who was sentenced to death last month for crimes against humanity.Asked if she could stay as long as she wanted, the minister said this was a different question. “She came here in a certain circumstance, and I think that circumstance clearly is a factor in what happens to her. But again, that is something in which she has to make up her mind,” he said. He also said India is a well-wisher of Bangladesh.“As a democratic country... we would like to see the will of the people ascertained. I’m quite confident that whatever comes out... would have a balanced and mature view about the relationship and, hopefully things would improve,” he said at Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.On the visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin , he said the India-Russia partnership has been among the “steadiest big relationships” in the last 70-80 years.Foreign minister Jaishankar disagreed that Putin’s visit could complicate India’s negotiations with the US on a bilateral trade agreement.“I think everybody knows that India has relations with all the major countries in the world,” Jaishankar said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. “I think for any country to expect to have a veto or a say in how we develop our relations with others is not a reasonable proposition,” he said.Jaishankar was asked if Putin’s two-day visit to New Delhi that focused largely on significantly enhancing the economic dimension of India-Russia ties will have a bearing on the negotiations with the US for the proposed trade deal. “Because remember, the others can expect the same. I think we’ve always made it very clear that we have multiple relationships. We have a freedom of choice,” he said. “We talk about what is called strategic autonomy and that continues and I cannot imagine why anybody would have reason to expect the contrary,” he added.The minister acknowledged that the focus of the Trump administration has been on trade and noted that India’s approach in navigating it is totally driven by national interests. “I think clearly right now trade is the most important issue there. We have, it’s clearly very central to the thinking in Washington, much more than it was to earlier administrations, which is something which we have recognised and we are prepared to meet,” he said.“But we are prepared to meet it on reasonable terms. I mean, for those of you who think that diplomacy is about pleasing somebody else I’m sorry, that’s not my view of diplomacy. I mean, to me, it is about defending our national interests,” he said.The India-US relations are going through possibly the worst phase in the last two decades after Washington imposed a whopping 50% on Indian goods, including 25% levies for New Delhi’s procurement of Russian crude. The two sides are currently holding negotiations for the proposed a trade deal “We believe that there can be a landing point for our respective trade interests. Obviously, that is something which will be negotiated hard because it has an implication for livelihoods in this country,” he said.“At the end of the day, for us the interests of the workers and the farmers and the small business and the middle class matters. When we look at a trade agreement with a country like the US, you have to be extremely judicious about your position, about what you put on the table,” he said.On President Putin’s trip to India, Jaishankar said for a “big” and “rising” country like India, it is important to maintain good cooperation with as many important players as possible in the world in line with freedom of choice.","India has so far not acceded to Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of Hasina, who was sentenced to death last month for crimes against humanity. “She came here in a certain circumstance, and I think that circumstance clearly is a factor in what happens to her.

"Govt caps flight fares, gives IndiGo 2 days to normalise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise/articleshow/125812074.cms,"Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

Cap on fares comes too late for lakhs

NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees and taxes extra). In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed. These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action in public interest.”","Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi- Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500. IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125812083,imgsize-71090,width-400,resizemode-4/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The University of Western Australia (UWA) is going to set up two Indian campuses — Chennai and Mumbai — with the university targeting Aug 2026 to start its first academic programme from the Chennai campus.Vice-chancellor Amit Chakma told TOI in an exclusive interaction that the two campuses will function as a single UWA entity in India and award full degrees of the Australian university.According to university officials, the Chennai campus will initially be technology-focused, while the Mumbai campus will be more busine-ss-oriented. Academic offerings will begin at the undergraduate level, with postgr-aduate programmes to be added soon after. “We are wo-rking against some very str-ict timeline to see whether we can start our first programme from Aug 2026,” Chakma said on Wednesday. “The Chennai campus initially would be more technology focused. .. and eventually we’ll build it up. The Mumbai campus probably would be more business centric,” he said. Both campuses will initially function from leased facilities, retrofitted for academic use.While Australia’s Deakin University and University of Wollongong have already started operations, Victoria University, Western Sydney University and La Trobe University have received permissions for the same.“India is a fascinating story unfolding,” said Chakma, adding that UWA sees strong long-term potential for India to emerge as a regional education hub. The entry of multiple international campuses reflects this shift.","The University of Western Australia (UWA) is going to set up two Indian campuses.

D’Souza has served as superior of the Jesuit community attached to Vatican Observatory since 2002



PANAJI: Physicist, astronomer, scientist, Indiana Jones. Not quite the words to describe a priest, let alone a 46-year-old Jesuit from Mapusa. But that is exactly what Fr Richard D’Souza is.At the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo, an ancient castle that once hosted pontiffs, D’Souza is piecing together the violent history of galactic cannibalism — the consumption of smaller galaxies by larger ones. “My work is basically to understand the histories of galaxies. I try to be a galactic archaeologist, so I put on this Indiana Jones cap and I try to see how galaxies grow to the massive size that they are,” he said.His breakthrough came in 2018, published in Nature Astronomy, when he and Eric Bell proposed that the Andromeda galaxy’s most significant merger — a violent collision that reshaped the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbour — occurred approximately 2 billion years ago.D’Souza’s own trajectory was less violent. Born in Pune in 1978, raised partly in Kuwait and partly in Goa, he entered the Society of Jesus, the formal name of the Jesuits, at 18.A Catholic order known for its intellectual pursuits, the society recognised in him something worth nurturing.“I used to go for camping trips while studying at St Britto’s, in the countryside, far away from the city lights where you could see the night sky. This was perhaps my first interest in the heavens, and this was confirmed a lot during my novitiate in Desur, Belagavi, which was a remote place where I could see the night sky,” said D’Souza.For his Jesuit formators, D’Souza’s path was neither straight nor predictable. After completing his physics degree at St Xavier’s College, Mumbai, he pursued a master’s degree in Heidelberg, working at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. Then came philosophy in Pune, as his Jesuit formation demanded, followed by theology. Then, a gravitational pull-back to physics through his doctoral work at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich.“I seriously started thinking of astronomy as a career when I started my master’s in physics at Heidelberg, where I did some small research project on astronomy, and it was this that really attracted me. I fell in love with the subject,” he said.Between philosophy and theology, he briefly veered towards social action in 2007 when he helped start St Paul’s Community College in Belagavi for school dropouts. This oscillation between the cosmic and the communal, between the spiritual and the celestial, should be debilitating. Not for him.“Our work at the observatory is basically doing scientific research with 80-90% of our time going in collecting and analysing data, and going for conferences. The remaining 10% of the time, we remind the Church that faith and science need to go together,” said D’Souza.Since 2022, D’Souza has served as superior of the Jesuit community attached to the Vatican Observatory. He is now director of the observatory itself, one of the oldest astronomical institutes in the world that dates back to 1774.Given that he straddles the two heavenly realms of theology and astronomy, he is often asked about extraterrestrial life. “I was waiting for this question and my response is, thank God I am not an expert on that,” he recently said at an event in Porvorim, blending humour with pragmatism.","Fr Richard D’Souza is a 46-year-old Jesuit from Mapusa.

Study: Inhaled toxic particles take direct route from lungs to brain

NEW DELHI: Communities living around areas in India that witness mining operations are showing measurable signs of lung impairment and heavy-metal exposure, according to new data tabled in Lok Sabha.The health ministry, citing Indian Council of Medical Research studies, has confirmed that residents in mining belts face risks comparable to those for workers directly involved in extraction.A National Institute of Occupational Health study of 1,202 people living near coal mines found abnormal pulmonary function in 14.3% of miners, 10% of supervisory staff and 7.8% of residents. Chest X-rays showed interstitial lung fibrosis in 2.5% of miners, 2.3% of supervisors and 2.7% of residents. Mercury levels above the permissible exposure limit (<5.8 Mu/dl) were detected in 6.8% of miners and 8% of residents, indicating exposure well beyond workplace boundaries.“These patterns tell us that fine coal dust and silica are travelling far into homes, schools and community spaces,” said Dr Dhiren Gupta, paediatric pulmonologist and allergy specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “When non-workers show lung abnormalities comparable to miners, it means even children and families are facing occupational-level exposure without protection.”In Bhilwara district, Rajasthan, children living near the Rampura Agucha mine had higher blood lead levels than control groups, though researchers did not detect toxicity or IQ decline. In Angul and Damanjodi in Odisha, an ICMR assessment found 2.35% and 2.04% respiratory impairment, respectively, among community members.Experts warn that such findings suggest deeper environmental lapses. “If residents show structural lung changes, it strongly indicates that dust suppression and emission control measures are nowhere near sufficient,” said Dr Pritpal Kaur, senior consultant, Pulmonology, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Delhi. She added that community-level exposure points to presence of fugitive dust, inadequate green buffers and outdated dust-control technology.Despite the red flags, mining companies told govt they already provided wide-ranging healthcare in affected areas. Coal India Limited runs 64 hospitals, 300 dispensaries and 18 mobile vans, while NLC India Ltd and Singareni Collieries conduct periodic screening through Occupational Health Centres.But public health specialists say these initiatives fall short of the long-term surveillance mining communities need. “Health camps and mobile units are episodic and basic,” said Dr Neetu Jain of PSRI Hospital. “Only structured programmes with regular screenings, specialist clinics and environmental audits can catch disease early and prevent irreversible damage.”The health ministry said it maintained coordination with the ministry of coal and district authorities to run national programmes relating to respiratory diseases, but experts believe the new data underscores the need for more rigorous monitoring and stronger environmental safeguards in India’s mining belts.","Residents in mining belts face risks comparable to those for workers directly involved in extraction.

SRINAGAR: A political face-off erupted Saturday over age relaxation for J&K’s civil services exam, with chief minister Omar Abdullah accusing LG Manoj Sinha of stalling a crucial file and the latter’s office firing back that “misleading” claims are being spread as the Dec 7 test looms.Abdullah said that uncertainty has gripped aspirants because of “Lok Bhavan’s delay in approving age relaxation, a provision granted multiple times in the past”, and urged J&K Public Service Commission (JKPSC) to postpone the combined competitive (preliminary) exam. He also cited travel chaos caused by ongoing airline disruptions.The row comes amid student protests seeking an increase in the age limit. J&K currently caps the age at 32 for open-category candidates and 37 for reserved categories. Aspirants said other states such as Uttarakhand and Haryana allow candidates up to 42 years, while UP, MP and Rajasthan set the limit at 40.With five days left for the exam, thousands of candidates remain caught between a stalled decision and the risk of missing what many call a once-in-a-year chance.The LG’s office said it received the age relaxation file on Dec 2 and returned it the same day with a query on whether it was “logistically possible” to alter eligibility criteria so close to the exam.“Despite lapse of four days Lok Bhavan did not receive any response. I fully sympathise with young aspirants,” the statement said, adding that social media posts on the issue were “misleading”.The LG’s office also underlined that JKPSC had published the exam advertisement on Aug 22 and notified Dec 7 as the exam date on Oct 6.NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq had earlier claimed the CM had already approved the age relaxation proposal and forwarded it to the LG on Dec 2. After the LG’s statement, Sadiq said there was “absolutely no reason for any further queries” if the file had already been cleared by the CM.Parties trained fire on both sides. “JKAS age relaxation issue is turning out yet another classical case of passing the buck at the cost of young aspirants,” Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone said. Congress urged both LG and CM to resolve the standoff without further delay, while PDP president Mehbooba Mufti called it “passing of responsibility”.",The row comes amid student protests seeking an increase in the age limit.

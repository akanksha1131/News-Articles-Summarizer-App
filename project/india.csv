‘Can happen to India’: Chavan slams Centre for not taking stance on Venezuela; claims govt ‘scared of Americans’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-happen-to-india-chavan-slams-centre-for-not-taking-stance-on-venezuela-claims-govt-scared-of-americans/articleshow/126365565.cms,"CPI-M Protests Near Us Consulate In Chennai Over Venezuela Attack

NEW DELHI: Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday stirred a controversy after he criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.This comes after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country on Saturday in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.Subsequently, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,” it added.Meanwhile, this is not the first time Chavan has made headlines for controversial remarks. Earlier in December, Chavan claimed that India was defeated on the first day of Operation Sindoor and that Indian aircraft were shot down during the four-day conflict.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor), we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda, or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan, which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” the Congress leader said.Later, Chavan refused to apologise for his controversial statement and said, “Why will I apologise? It is out of the question. The Constitution gives me the right to ask questions.”","Prithviraj Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. “Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter.

Ambala man arrested for allegedly spying on Air Force; under investigation



NEW DELHI: In two separate cases of alleged espionage reported within 24 hours, authorities in Punjab and Haryana have arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pathankot and a contractor from Ambala for allegedly sharing sensitive defence-related information with Pakistan-linked handlers. Police in both states said the accused were in contact with individuals across the border and had passed on details connected to key security installations.A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI , terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers, Punjab Police said on Tuesday.Police identified the juvenile as Sanjeev Kumar . According to officials, he was tricked by Pakistani handlers on social media. Police said he believed that his father had been murdered, which made him emotionally vulnerable.SSP Pathankot Daljinder Singh Dhillon said, ""The police have arrested Sanjeev Kumar, aged 15, after receiving information that he had been supplying information related to the security of our nation to the frontal organisations of terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers.""He added that the boy was drawn in by Pakistani accounts online.""He fell into the trap of Pakistani agencies through social media, as he was suspicious that his father had been murdered, which affected him mentally. However, the investigation did not reveal any such evidence,"" Dhillon said.According to police, Sanjeev had sent videos of several sensitive locations and had been in contact with gangsters based in Pakistan who run terror modules. ""He had been in contact with Pakistan’s terror organisations for almost a year,"" the SSP said.Police are investigating how much information he shared and who he was in contact with. The boy is currently in custody, and further action will be taken based on the investigation.In an another incident in neighbouring state -- Haryana, another man in Ambala was held for allegedly spying on Air Force, as confirmed by DSP Crime on Tuesday.DSP Crime Virendra Kumar said the accused, Sunil alias Sunny, had been a contractor handling repair work at an Air Force station since 2020.“The police had information that he was providing details about our defence area, specifically the Air Force. His mobile was seized and several suspicious things emerged from it,” Kumar said.The officer added that Sunil had been in contact with a woman who allegedly asked for information, which he passed on. “According to his device, he used to send information to a neighbouring country, which we can call an enemy country. But this is his version. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.Sunil is married with two children and is currently on four days of remand. The probe is in its initial stages.","A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI, terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

"Suprme Court denies Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam bail; allows it for five co-accused",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suprme-court-denies-umar-khalid-sharjeel-imam-bail-allows-it-for-five-co-accused/articleshow/126363870.cms,"‘Really Happy For Others’: SC Rejects Umar Khalid’S Bail; Partner Shares His Reaction

What explains inconsistencies in deciding bail pleas in recent past



NEW DELHI: Holding that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be a “trump card” to get bail in UAPA offences and that a court cannot treat liberty of an accused as the sole criterion and societal security as peripheral, Supreme Court Monday rejected bail pleas of student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the Delhi riots case but granted relief to other five co-accused — Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman, Mohd Saleem Khan and Shadab Ahmad.The case relates to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turning violent, leading to communal clashes during the visit of US President Trump in 2020.Khalid and Imam, who along with others have been in jail for over five years, may have to spend another year in prison as the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said they can apply afresh after a year or after all protected witnesses have been examined, whichever is earlier.The bench cited “hierarchy of culpability” to say Khalid and Imam stood on a different footing than the others.Granting bail is the discretionary power of a court and the outcome of a bail plea largely depends on the approach of a bench and that perhaps explains inconsistency of Supreme Court’s in the recent past in deciding cases, particularly those related to serious offences under special acts like PMLA and UAPA which provide stringent bail conditions..In some cases, like those of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Tamil Nadu minister, Senthil Balaji, accused's constitutional right to speedy trial was given precedence over the seriousness of the alleged offence and bail was granted on the ground of long incarceration and delay in trial. In some others; for instance, Gurvinder Singh v State of Punjab, gravity of the offence has been the deciding factor, with SC expressly cautioning against the mechanical invocation of prolonged incarceration as a ground for bail in cases involving serious offences under special enactments.While dealing in UAPA case, a three judge bench had in 2021 held that Section 43D(5) of UAPA per se does not prevent constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights of accused.""Courts are expected to appreciate legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part of the prescribed sentence,"" Justice Surya Kant, now the CJI, who penned the judgement for the bench said.Justice Kant had said such an approach would safeguard against the possibility of provisions like Section 43D (5) of UAPA being used as the sole metric for denial of bail or for wholesale breach of constitutional right to speedy trial.While rejecting bail plea of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria referred to 2021 judgement and said ""The same decision, however, does not indicate as laying down a mechanical rule under which the mere passage of time becomes determinative in every case arising under a special statute. The jurisprudence of this Court does not support a construction whereby delay simpliciter eclipses a statutory regime enacted by Parliament to address offences of a special category. ""It said the proper constitutional question, therefore, is not whether Article 21 (right to life and liberty) is superior to Section 43D (5) of UAPA dealing with the higher bail threshold. ""The proper question is how Article 21 is to be applied where Parliament has expressly conditioned the grant of bail in relation to offences alleged to implicate national security. The law does not contemplate an either-or approach. Nor does it contemplate an unstructured blending of statutory and constitutional considerations. What is required is disciplined judicial scrutiny that gives due regard to both"".While granting bail to an accused in 2024 who was under custody for four years and trial had not initiated, SC had said the ""the over-arching postulate of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty cannot be brushed aside lightly, howsoever stringent the penal law may be"".The court had said, ""If the State or any prosecuting agency including the court concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime. ”In an important ruling, SC in 2024 held that the conventional idea ‘bail is the rule, jail is an exception’ should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also other offences for which special statutes have been enacted like UAPA if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.In cases of Khalid and Imam the court emphasised that they also contributed to the delay in trial.",Supreme Court Monday rejected bail pleas of student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the Delhi riots case.

"After PM’s tribute to Somnath temple, BJP blames Nehru for distorting history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-pms-tribute-to-somnath-temple-bjp-blames-nehru-for-distorting-history/articleshow/126363852.cms,"NEW DELHI : After PM Narendra Modi penned a tribute to Somnath temple and described it as a symbol of India’s civilisational resilience and its indomitable spirit, BJP said Monday its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni 1,000 years back was driven by religious fanaticism and blamed Jawaharlal Nehru and “leftist” historians of portraying the Muslim invader as a mere plunderer.At a presser, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi framed US President Donald Trump’s claim post-Op Sindoor that India and Pakistan had been fighting for 1,000 years against the backdrop of Ghazni’s plundering expeditions to India.“Trump had also said that the conflict between India and Pakistan is 1,000 years old and that Kashmir is linked to that. It’s indeed a 1,000-yearold fight. Pakistan’s missiles are named after Ghazni, Babar and Ghori,” he said.Modi will join the “Somnath Swabhiman Parv” on Jan 11 to celebrate the resilience of the Indian civilisation, lauding its spirit that led to its rebuilding, last time after independence, after being vandalised and looted repeatedly by invaders.Spiritual figures praised Modi for spreading awareness about the Shiva temple, one of the 12 jyotirlingas dedicated to the god, and the programme. It is a centre of the country’s faith, preacher Morari Bapu said, adding joining the endeavour is essential to ensure that the temple does not suffer any attack in future.Swami Avdheshanand of Juna Akhara praised the write-up, saying the temple stands as an ode to Indian civilisation.Attacking past historians, Trivedi said Nehru’s book ‘Discovery of India’ was a source of historical distortions. Nehru had described Mahmoud of Ghazni as far more a warrior than a man of faith who exploited the name of religion for his conquest to earn treasures and materials, He cited work of a historian to claim the invader was very much motivated by religious fanaticism in his destruction of the temple as he wanted to be known as a “but-shikan” (idol-breaker).","PM Narendra Modi penned a tribute to Somnath temple and described it as a symbol of India’s civilisational resilience and its indomitable spirit.

"Fearless judges bedrock of judiciary, can’t be penalised for error of judgment: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fearless-judges-bedrock-of-judiciary-cant-be-penalised-for-error-of-judgment-supreme-court/articleshow/126363824.cms,"Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary : SC



NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.","Supreme Court held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary.

"Juvenile at time of crime, man walks free after 13 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juvenile-at-time-of-crime-man-walks-free-after-13-years/articleshow/126363533.cms,"DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand high court has ordered the release of a man who had been serving a life sentence in a 2003 murder case, after it found he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. Mobin, who spent over 13 years in prison, was declared a juvenile in conflict with law, rendering his continued detention unlawful under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.The order was passed by a division bench comprising justices Ravindra Maithani and Ashish Naithani.Mobin had been convicted of murder and robbery under sections 302 and 393 of IPC by the additional district and sessions judge in Roorkee on Feb 15, 2008. His conviction was later upheld by HC on March 20, 2013, with the Supreme Court dismissing his appeal for grant of innocence in Aug 2013.The case dated back to June 24, 2003, when Mobin and four others — Imran, Shaharwan, Mustakeem and Farman — intercepted two men travelling on a scooter near Kaliyar in Roorkee. One of the victims, Jaipal Singh, was killed, while the other, Mahendra Singh, sustained injuries and was robbed.During the course of trial, Mustakeem and Farman were declared juveniles, while the remaining three, including Mobin, were sentenced as adults.Several years after his conviction, Mobin filed an application from jail, stating that he too had been a minor on the date of the offence, requesting that his case be reconsidered in light of the applicable juvenile law. The HC received this communication on June 15, 2021, and subsequently sought a report from police to verify his age. However, the report failed to offer a conclusive determination.On Aug 19, 2025, the court directed its registrar (judicial) to conduct an independent inquiry into Mobin’s age at the time of the incident. The registrar submitted a detailed report based on school records, witness statements and official documents, confirming that Mobin’s date of birth was May 22, 1988 — a finding the court deemed credible and reliable.","Uttarakhand high court has ordered the release of a man who had been serving a life sentence in a 2003 murder case.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

NEW DELHI: Amid a tightening security environment shaped by a militarily assertive China and a volatile Pakistan, the defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly Rs 79,000 crore, marking one of the most consequential procurement approvals in recent years. The clearances were accorded by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh , which approved a wide range of systems spanning air defence missiles, combat drones, long-range rockets, air-to-air weapons, aerial refuellers and counter-drone technologies.Senior military officials have repeatedly stressed that future conflicts will be defined by speed, precision and the ability to fight across domains. “Timely induction of critical capabilities is essential to maintain operational readiness in a rapidly evolving threat environment,” the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, said recently, underscoring the urgency behind such decisions. While Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) is only the first step in the procurement process, it formally establishes the armed forces’ requirements and allows detailed tenders, trials and negotiations to begin.Taken together, the latest approvals offer a revealing snapshot of how India’s armed forces are recalibrating for wars that may unfold under the shadow of drone swarms, long-range missiles, electronic warfare and sustained precision strikes. Many of the systems cleared have been shaped by operational lessons from recent crises, assessed against the growing missile and air power capabilities of China and Pakistan, and aligned with a more pragmatic “Make in India with partners” approach rather than doctrinaire import substitution. What follows is not merely a list of acquisitions, but an emerging blueprint for how India plans to deter, and if necessary fight, high-intensity conflicts across its borders in the coming decade.The single largest approval under the latest DAC meeting is the Rs 30,000 crore procurement of a large number of Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles for the Indian Air Force and Navy. Jointly developed by India and Israel, Barak-8 has become the backbone of India’s medium-tier air defence architecture.With an interception range of over 70 km, Barak-8 is designed to neutralise a wide spectrum of aerial threats, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Its advanced active radar seeker and ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously make it critical in countering saturation attacks.The missile system proved its operational value during the cross-border hostilities in May, when Pakistan launched multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles. Barak-8 was part of India’s multi-layered air defence network that successfully intercepted incoming threats, preventing damage to key military installations.For the Navy, Barak-8 is deployed aboard frontline destroyers, frigates and aircraft carriers, providing area air defence against anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft. For the IAF, ground-based Barak-8 squadrons protect air bases and strategic assets. The new procurement aims to significantly bolster missile stocks, addressing concerns over wartime depletion and sustained engagements.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two additional MQ-9B Predator drones for a period of three years. These high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles will supplement the two Predators currently operated by the Navy.MQ-9Bs are capable of flying for over 30 hours at altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet, providing persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance across vast areas. They are particularly valuable for maritime domain awareness in the Indian Ocean Region, tracking hostile naval movements and monitoring choke points.The leased drones are meant to bridge a critical capability gap until India receives 31 armed MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft systems under the $3.8 billion deal signed with the US in October last year. Deliveries under that deal are expected only in 2029–30.By opting for a lease rather than outright purchase, the military avoids a capability vacuum during a period of heightened regional tensions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and along the Line of Actual Control with China.Another major clearance is the long-pending acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for the Indian Air Force at a cost exceeding Rs 9,000 crore. The lack of adequate aerial refuellers has long constrained the IAF’s ability to sustain long-range air operations.Under the approved plan, Israel Aerospace Industries will convert six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial aircraft into aerial tankers. The conversion involves structural reinforcement, installation of refuelling booms, fuel tanks and mission systems.A fresh AoN was required because the tender resulted in a single-vendor situation. Despite that, the urgency of the requirement has pushed the government to move ahead.Mid-air refuellers dramatically extend the operational reach and endurance of fighter jets, transport aircraft and surveillance platforms. They are especially critical for deep-penetration strikes, rapid force mobilisation, and sustained air patrols over contested areas. With China operating a growing fleet of refuellers and Pakistan steadily upgrading its air force, the IAF’s refuelling gap had become increasingly stark.Two crucial indigenous missile projects cleared by the DAC focus on extending India’s air-to-air combat envelope. The first is the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missile, whose range is being enhanced from the current 100 km to around 200 km.Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Astra is India’s first indigenous beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. It is already integrated with Su-30MKI fighters and is slated for deployment on Tejas and other platforms.The IAF is expected to place an initial order for 600–700 Astra Mk-2 missiles. In parallel, work is underway on Astra Mark-3, which will have an estimated range of around 350 km, placing it firmly in the long-range interception category.Indigenous long-range air-to-air missiles are increasingly important as aerial combat shifts from close dogfights to stand-off engagements, where detection, tracking and first-shot capability determine outcomes.The DAC’s nod for extending the range of Pinaka guided rocket ammunition marks a major leap in India’s artillery firepower. Pinaka multiple launch rocket systems currently fire rockets up to a range of 75 km, already giving them an edge over older systems.The new guided variants aim to extend that range to 120 km, with future plans to reach up to 300 km. According to officials, the 120-km version was successfully tested on Sunday, demonstrating improved accuracy and lethality.A 300-km Pinaka would fundamentally alter battlefield dynamics, allowing the Army to strike deep into enemy territory without relying on air power. Such capability is particularly relevant along mountainous borders, where terrain and weather often limit air operations.Pinaka’s modular design and compatibility with different warheads make it a versatile system for counter-battery fire, suppression of enemy air defences and destruction of logistics hubs.While indigenous systems form the core of the modernisation drive, the DAC also approved additional procurements of select foreign munitions to plug immediate gaps. This includes more Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles for Rafale fighters.With a range of 120–150 km, Meteor is considered one of the most lethal air-to-air missiles in service today, featuring a ramjet propulsion system that maintains high energy throughout its flight.The council also cleared the acquisition of Israeli guidance kits for SPICE-1000 precision-guided bombs. These kits transform conventional bombs into long-range, highly accurate weapons capable of striking targets from up to 125 km away.Together, these munitions significantly enhance the Rafale’s stand-off strike and air dominance capabilities, allowing it to engage high-value targets without entering heavily defended airspace.Among the most telling approvals is the procurement of 850 kamikaze drones, or loitering munitions, for the Army’s new ‘Shaktibaan’ and ‘Divyastra’ artillery batteries at a cost of around Rs 2,000 crore.Loitering munitions combine surveillance and strike capabilities in a single platform. They can hover over a target area, identify enemy assets and then dive onto the target with an explosive payload.The drones approved under this programme will be manufactured in India, either by domestic firms or through foreign collaboration. Their induction reflects lessons drawn from conflicts such as Ukraine, where loitering munitions have been used extensively for precision strikes against armour, artillery and air defence systems.For the Indian Army, these drones provide a flexible, cost-effective tool for real-time battlefield engagement without risking pilots or high-value aircraft.The DAC also cleared the indigenous Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-2. Equipped with 30-kilowatt lasers, the system can disable, degrade or destroy small remotely piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges of up to 3.5 km.Drone swarms are increasingly viewed as a major threat, capable of overwhelming traditional air defence systems through sheer numbers. Laser-based systems offer a relatively low-cost, rapid-response solution to such threats.The IDD&IS integrates detection, tracking and neutralisation into a single platform, making it suitable for protecting air bases, ammunition depots and critical infrastructure. Its approval signals a recognition that future conflicts will involve contested airspace even at very low altitudes.Beyond new acquisitions, the DAC approved overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main battle tanks in India. These overhauls aim to extend the service life and operational readiness of existing platforms.Mi-17 helicopters form the backbone of the IAF’s medium-lift fleet, supporting transport, casualty evacuation and special operations. T-90 tanks remain central to the Army’s armoured formations, particularly along the western front.Sustaining these platforms is critical even as newer systems are inducted, ensuring there are no capability gaps during the transition phase.Several smaller but vital projects were also cleared. These include low-level lightweight radars for detecting aerial threats, bollard-pull naval tugs for harbour operations, full mission simulators for Tejas fighter jets, and automatic take-off and landing recording systems for the IAF.The DAC also approved the acquisition of high-frequency software-defined radios to enable secure long-range communications across services. Such systems are essential for network-centric warfare, allowing forces to share data in real time.While less visible than missiles or drones, these enablers are critical for operational effectiveness, training and safety.Taken together, the Rs 79,000 crore modernisation push offers a clear snapshot of how India expects future wars to be fought. The focus is on layered air defence, long-range precision strikes, persistent surveillance, unmanned systems and electronic resilience.Rather than betting on a single platform or technology, the approvals reflect a systems-based approach, integrating missiles, drones, aircraft and sensors into a cohesive combat network. The blend of indigenous development and selective imports suggests a more mature procurement philosophy, driven by operational need rather than ideology.","The defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly Rs 79,000 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

ji

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday likened US President Donald Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini over the United States’ actions in Venezuela. He also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly yielding to Trump’s demand to cut India’s purchase of oil from Russia, which has been at war with Ukraine since February 2022.“What is happening in Venezuela today is not good for the world. Trump is trying to frighten people across the globe,” Kharge told reporters in Delhi, referring to the US military action in Venezuela that led to the ouster of Maduro. The Venezuelan leader and his wife were then takento New York to face multiple charges, primarily related to narco-terrorism.Alleging that the US president was indulging in “expansionism,” the Congress chief said that leaders who attempt to expand their territories, like Hitler and Mussolini, “do not remain in power for long.”Kharge further referred to Trump's repeated claim about ending the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict, saying that he has repeated his claim around 70 times.""What does it mean? That he (Trump) is a tall personality and he can make the world bow to him. But the world won't bow before him. We live in a democracy, only through a democratic method we have to go ahead...Nehru's policy was 'live and let live'. That is our policy,"" he added.Reacting to Trump’s recent statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi knows he (Trump) is unhappy with India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, Kharge invoked a dialogue from the 1989 Hindi film ""Mr. India.""“It shows that PM Modi is under Trump’s control. I am reminded of a dialogue from Mr. India — ‘Mogambo khush hua’ (Mogambo is happy). If people with such a mindset try to scare the world, India is not going to cower. But I do not understand why Modi ji is bending before him. This is harmful for the nation. Stand for the country. You nod to whatever he says. The country did not elect you just to nod,” the veteran politician remarked.The US has imposed 50% tariffs on India, with the second 25% tranche linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. Washington has accused India of “funding Putin’s war machine” in Ukraine.The Republican leader has also repeatedly claimed that he used trade leverage to push India and Pakistan into a ceasefire agreement. However, New Delhi has consistently maintained that the ceasefire talks were a bilateral matter and were held following a request from Islamabad.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge likened US President Donald Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

Congress dismisses 'Rahul vs Priyanka'



The great Rahul paradox



Priyanka steps forward



Whispers within the chambers



What next?



NEW DELHI: The Congress move to appoint Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the candidate screening committee for the upcoming Assam elections has added to the murmurs of leadership debate within the grand old party, with the BJP-led NDA claiming internal conflict between the Gandhi siblings. Soon after Priyanka's elevation, which was announced on Sunday, the BJP claimed that the Congress was divided between camps of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi . The Congress, as expected, strongly rejected these claims and slammed the BJP for spreading ""manufactured propaganda.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""The Rahul vs Priyanka camp has been going on for a very long time in the Congress party. All the pressure was exerted by the Rahul camp. 'Remove Rahul, bring Priyanka' is happening in Congress. Now even their allies don't trust Rahul Gandhi. Their own leaders don't want him; instead, they want Priyanka Gandhi.""The Janata Dal (United) also reacted to Priyanka's appointment, claiming that Rahul Gandhi's frequent foreign trips had shifted responsibilities to her.""It is expected that legislative assembly elections will be held in five states. The Congress's internal matters are handled by a screening committee.Who will handle this work when Rahul Gandhi is abroad? The responsibility has fallen on Priyanka Gandhi. However, this is their internal matter,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.The Congress has formally dismissed the NDA's claims, insisting there is no Rahul vs Priyanka camp within the party.On Sunday, the party defended its decision to appoint AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the Assam screening committee, strongly criticising the BJP for attempting to ""propagate"" a false leadership contest narrative.The Congress asserted that this was not the first time Priyanka had been entrusted with such responsibilities, recalling that she had earlier served as an ex-officio member of the screening committee during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Congress MP Tariq Anwar told IANS, ""Earlier, she was the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh when assembly elections were held there. So we cannot say this is the first time. This is the second time she has been given charge of a state related to elections. She will use her political experience and capability in Assam. There is a strong possibility of a Congress comeback in Assam.""""Priyanka Gandhi has been serving as general secretary for the past five years. She has been given organisational responsibilities from time to time and has worked across the country. Therefore, the notion propagated by the BJP is incorrect,"" he added.Congress leader Udit Raj also defended Priyanka's appointment, citing her ""wide influence and experience"".Speaking to IANS, Raj said, ""She is our leader and has been made chairperson of the Assam screening committee. Her influence is quite wide. She will oversee elections and make selections. She already has experience, and that experience will increase further.""Rahul Gandhi's position within the Congress is currently stronger than it has been at any point since his resignation as party president in 2019. After years of refusing formal office while leading high-visibility foot marches such as the Bharat Jodo Yatra (2022–23) and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in early 2024, the Lok Sabha election results that year altered the equation.The Congress's improved performance, winning 99 Lok Sabha seats and securing the Leader of the Opposition post, did something the party had struggled to achieve for a decade: it gave Rahul constitutional weight.That momentum, however, was not sustained.Since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA staged a strong comeback, winning assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar.Rahul Gandhi led campaigns raising the ‘vote chori' charge and spearheaded the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Bihar, hoping to replicate the gains of his earlier mass movements.The narrative failed to resonate electorally, and the Congress emerged as the weakest link in the Bihar opposition, winning only six of the state's 243 assembly seats.At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has unmistakably moved out of the occasional-campaigner role. Once deployed sparingly for high-voltage rallies, she is now a constant presence, both in Parliament and on the streets.During the Winter Session of Parliament, the first-time MP from Wayanad assumed a leading role for the party. With a smile, she was seen patiently attacking the Modi government during the Vande Mataram debate.The Wayanad MP also was at the forefront when the opposition parties staged a walkout from Lok Sabha to protest against the VB-G RAM G Bill.She led the march within the Parliament premises while holding a photograph of Mahatma Gandhi.Despite Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament, the Congress drew significant attention for its aggressive protests and Priyanka emerged as a prominent face of the party both inside and outside the House.At the end of the session, she also attended the customary tea meeting hosted by Speaker Om Birla and was seen chatting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from across parties.Though there has been no formal resolution, several reports have quoted ""voices within the Congress"" urging a larger organisational role for Priyanka, including suggestions that she could serve as party president or national face.After Rahul's resignation as Congress chief, former MP Abhijit Mukherjee, son of former President Pranab Mukherjee, openly appealed for Priyanka to take over, saying she should heed the ""clarion call of lakhs of Congress workers"".Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Anil Shastri has also said Priyanka Gandhi would be the best person to lead the party.Over time, and following successive assembly election losses, these whispers have grown louder.In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi questioning the current leadership and explicitly seeking a ""greater central role"" for Priyanka.MP Imran Masood has also pushed for her elevation, arguing, ""Make her the Prime Minister and see how she responds, just like Indira Gandhi did,"" signalling that she should be the party's main face and de facto leader.Internal conflict or not, the specific role given to Priyanka in Assam elections does give credence to talks of her eventual elevation within the party. It is an important move in a politically sensitive state which the Congress hopes to wrest from the BJP. The Congress would hope that Priyanka's greater involvement in the state elections will help to counter BJP's ‘double-engine government' campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.With the Congress till now projecting Rahul Gandhi as its only face, any greater role for Priyanka cannot be dismissed as a routine organisational decision. The move comes amid wider discussions on leadership, strategy and the future direction of the opposition camp.The final verdict, however, will come from voters, and not from whispers or internal demands. In the 2021 assembly elections, the BJP won 60 seats with 33.6% vote share and the Congress got 29 seats with 30% vote share.What happens in Assam over the next few months, as the state prepares to elect a new government this year, may play a role in shaping the future of the Congress leadership and also the Gandhi siblings.","Congress appoints Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the candidate screening committee for the upcoming Assam elections.

BJP Welcomes SC Denial Of Bail To Umar Khalid And Sharjeel Imam; Opposition Calls It Unfortunate

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Monday came out in support of New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani for writing a letter to 2020 Delhi riots co-accused Umar Khalid.Chavan said that, as a person of Indian origin, Mamdani had “every right to intervene.”“He (Mamdani) has faith in Indian politics. He spoke in Hindi during his campaign, appealing to Indians there. Indian blood flows in him, so if injustice is happening to an Indian, he has every right to intervene, whether he is an American citizen or not. But more importantly, human rights are supreme. So I think there’s no need to panic if he wrote a letter,” Chavan told news agency PTI.The socialist Democrat, New York City’s first Muslim and Indian-origin mayor, is the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic Mahmood Mamdani. The 34-year-old was sworn in on New Year’s Day after winning the mayoral election in November last year.In his handwritten note to Khalid, who has been in jail since his arrest in September 2020, months after communal riots rocked the national capital in February that year, Mamdani wrote: “Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents.We are all thinking of you.”The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of two Delhi riots accused—Khalid and Sharjeel Imam—and granted bail, subject to conditions, to five others. They had challenged the Delhi high court’s rejection of their pleas.Meanwhile, Chavan’s remarks come days after he drew flak for claiming that India was “defeated” on the first day of its four-day conflict with Pakistan in May 2025. He later refused to apologise despite widespread outrage.In July last year, he had also sparked controversy by questioning why anti-terror operations were being given ""Hindu names.""",Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan came out in support of New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani for writing a letter to 2020 Delhi riots co-accused Umar Khalid.

Why SC rejected Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam bail?

What are the charges

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam -- lodged in Tihar jail under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to 2020 Delhi riots.The bench of justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria said that prosecution material disclosed a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, thereby attracting the statutory bar to bail under Section 43D(5) of UAPA.The bench added that the Khaild and Imam can pray for bail after one year after the completion of examination of protected witnesses.Meanwhile, the top court granted bail to 5 other accused in the case, adding twelve strict conditions.All seven accused had challenged Delhi high court's order denying them bail on September 2.The top court said that not every accused involved in the case stands on same footing. It said that both Khalid and Imam had a ""formative role"" in the conspiracy .""Umar Khalid and Sharjeel stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpability. It becomes a court to examine bail pleas individually to see whether pre-trial liberty is attracted.Liberty is of foundational importance at the same time, the constitution does not conceive liberty in isolation,"" the top court said.""This court is satisfied that the prosecution material disclosed a prima facie allegation against the appellants Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam. The statutory threshold stands attracted qua these appellants. This stage of proceedings does not justify their enlargement on bail. Apart from death or destruction the provision encompasses acts that disrupt services and threaten the economy,"" it added.The court said that in prosecutions under the UAPA, delay in trial does not operate as a ""trump card"" which automatically displaces statutory safeguards.""The UAPA as a special statute represents a legislative judgment as to the conditions on which bail may be granted in pre-trial stage. Delay serves as a trigger for heightened judicial scrutiny. The discussion has been confined to delay and prolonged incarceration. UAPA offences are rarely confined to isolated acts. The statutory scheme reflects this understanding,"" it said.""Section 43D(5) of UAPA departs from general provisions for grant of bail. (But) it does not exclude judicial scrutiny or mandate denial of bail in default,"" it added.Meanwhile, during the hearing, the advocates who appeared for them mostly argued on the delay and the unlikelihood of the commencement of the trial. It was also stated to the court that they have been under custody for over five years in a case in which they are facing serious allegations of committing offences under the UAPA.The contentions were also made that there is no proof of violence that they instigated the riots, even after five years have passed.Khalid along with several others have been charged in connection to an alleged conspiracy behind the communal riots which took place in Delhi in February 2020.Khalid was arrested in September 2020, charging him under several sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act including terrorist activity and conspiracy.Additionally he was also charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code including murder, rioting, sedition, conspiracy and promoting communal enmity.According to Delhi Police, 53 people died in the violence and more five hundred people were injured.On September 2, the Delhi high court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others -- Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.",Supreme Court rejects the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam.

What the court said

What the Supreme Court said:

The court observed that Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam stand on a “qualitatively different footing” compared to the other accused, both in terms of the prosecution’s case and the evidence on record.

The SC said their roles were “central” to the alleged offences.

The bench noted that although their incarceration has been long and continuous, it does not violate constitutional guarantees nor override the statutory bar on bail under the applicable law.

The Supreme Court held that the prosecution material discloses a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam.

It said the statutory threshold for denying bail under the law stands attracted in their case.

At the present stage of the proceedings, the court ruled that they do not deserve to be released on bail.

Activists Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad, however, were granted bail by the Supreme Court.

BJP Claims Rahul Gandhi Ties To ‘Anti-India’ Panel Over US Lawmakers' Umar Khalid Letter

The case so far

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday pronounced its verdict on Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and several others, rejecting their bail plea in the Delhi 2020 riots case.A bench comprising Justices Aravind Kumar and N.V. Anjaria rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, saying that the two stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpabilty.""Khalid and Imam can pray for bail after one year,"" the SC added, saying that that terrorist act under UAPA is not confined to conventional warfare but includes all acts of attacking national integrity and sovereignity.The accused had challenged a Delhi High Court order refusing them bail in a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to the alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2020 north-east Delhi riots.The SC however granted bail to Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad.Counsel appearing for the accused had argued primarily on the prolonged incarceration of the petitioners and the uncertainty over the commencement of the trial. They had told the court that the accused have been in custody for more than five years despite facing serious charges under the UAPA, and contended that there was no evidence to show that they had instigated violence during the riots even after such a long period.Opposing the pleas, the Delhi Police had maintained that the alleged offences amounted to a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state. It argued that the violence was not the result of spontaneous protests but part of a well-planned “pan-India” conspiracy aimed at “regime change” and “economic strangulation”.The police further submitted that the conspiracy was allegedly timed to coincide with the official visit of the then US President to India, with the objective of attracting international media attention and globalising opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA, it said, was deliberately chosen as a “radicalising catalyst” under the guise of “peaceful protest”.According to the prosecution, the “deep-rooted, premeditated and pre-planned conspiracy” allegedly orchestrated by the accused led to the deaths of 53 people and extensive damage to public property, resulting in the registration of 753 FIRs in Delhi alone. It also claimed that evidence on record indicated an attempt to replicate the conspiracy on a pan-India scale, citing, among other things, the use of various WhatsApp groups, including the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) and the Jamia Awareness Campaign Team.The Delhi Police argued that delays in the trial were attributable to the accused themselves and submitted that, if they cooperated, the trial could be concluded within two years.On September 2, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others — Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.","SC Rejects Bail Plea Of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam; Grants Bail To 5 Others In Delhi Riots Case.

(AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126315999,imgsize-58066,width-400,resizemode-4/underwater-tunnel.jpg"

It asked Singhvi to take instruction within a week whether Telangana would prefer filing a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution making all three states — AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra — parties.AP through senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Jaideep Gupta and Balbir Singh told the court that the project had Telangana’s consent at the time of reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh. Rohatgi said the tender is for preparation of DPR for the irrigation project, which is meant to use only the excess flood water flowing through AP, which is the lower riparian state.Singhvi said there was no means to measure excess flood water and alleged that it was a guise to misappropriate around 200 tmc of water allocated to Telangana, which he said is in the process of building various barrages to utilise its share of 968 tmc water. “It is a huge emotive issue in Telangana as commissioning of the irrigation project would cut the state’s share of Godavari water,” he said.Gupta said, “What is an emotive issue? Can one state stop an irrigation project in another state which is a lower riparian one? Telangana has already taken Hyderabad.” Rohatgi said the project is to take water to drought prone areas & the DPR preparation is being pursued after approval of a pre-feasibility report.",Sparks flew in SC as Telangana opposed Andhra Pradesh’s Polavaram-Nallamala Sagar Project.

Forest encroachment in state smacks of bureaucrat-squatter nexus: Supeme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forest-encroachment-in-state-smacks-of-bureaucrat-squatter-nexus-supeme-court/articleshow/126363334.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday slammed the Uttarakhand govt for being a silent spectator for two decades to rampant encroachment of forest land in Rishikesh , which was allotted in 1950 to Gandhian Mira Behn by the then UP govt, and said it smacked of nexus between the executive and squatters. The court also sought details of such illegal constructions.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the facts of this case, prima facie, show how private individuals systematically grabbed thousands of acres of forest land while the state govt remained in slumber from 2000 till 2023.Uttarakhand’s deputy advocate general Jatinder Kumar Sethi informed the court that the state had recovered around 500 acres of forest land from encroachers in 2023 and an additional 50 acres in the drive carried out in the last three days at Rishikesh. He said the state would continue the drive against encroachers.However, the bench said the way squatters enjoyed residential rights unauthorisedly over vast tracts of forest land for more than two decades indicated collusion among politicians, bureaucrats and encroachers. It asked the state to file a detailed affidavit describing the extent of encroachment, nature of constructions and the officers who were at the helm of affairs between 2000-2023 for protection of govt land in the area.Of the 2,866 acres of land notified as forest area by the state, a part was leased to Pashulok Sewa Samiti, which was an organization associated with Pashulok Ashram established by British born Mira Behn (Madeleine Slade). The society came under liquidation and surrendered 594 acres of land to the forest department on Oct 23, 1984. Yet certain private individuals took control of the land.The bench in its previous order had said, “What seems shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land was being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes.” It enlarged the scope of the petition and directed the state’s chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forest to constitute an inquiry committee to examine all issues and submit a report to SC.“Meanwhile, all private individuals are restrained from alienating the land, encumbering it or creating any third-party rights. It goes without saying that no construction activity shall be allowed to take place either. The vacant land (other than the residential houses) shall be taken into possession by the forest department and the collector concerned,” the bench had ordered on Dec 22 last year.",Uttarakhand’s deputy advocate general Jatinder Kumar Sethi informed the court that the state had recovered around 500 acres of forest land from encroachers in 2023.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLAs on Monday staged a protest inside the Delhi Assembly premises, drawing attention to the worsening air pollution levels in the national capital.Leader of opposition in the Assembly, Atishi, led the protest amid AAP's efforts to press for urgent policy measures and accountability on Delhi's deteriorating air quality.The protest highlighted concerns over public health, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, as Delhi continues to struggle with hazardous air quality. Party leaders demanded immediate action by the government to implement stricter measures to curb pollution, including emissions from vehicles, industrial discharges, and stubble burning from neighbouring states.Meanwhile, several Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Guwahati, woke up to a layer of fog on Monday morning. Air quality varied from 'poor' to very poor' category across several parts of the national capital, while several flights were delayed at the IGI Airport.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi recorded AQI at 260 in the 'Poor' category by 8 am on Monday.Visuals from Akshardham showed the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 294, falling in the 'poor' category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCM).At ITO, the AQI was recorded as 256, also categorised as 'poor', while Anand Vohar reported a sharper decline at 320, placing the area in the 'very poor' bracket.Chandni Chowk remained among the worst-affected areas, recording an AQI of 337, classified as 'very poor'.

‘Tipu-Ipu ko maro’: Himanta Biswa Sarma backs dropping ‘Great’ from Akbar; row over alleged NCERT move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tipu-ipu-ko-maro-himanta-biswa-sarma-backs-dropping-great-from-akbar-row-over-alleged-ncert-move/articleshow/125515140.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday backed NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great” from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.Speaking at an event in Bongaigaon, he said, ""Tipu-Ipu ko maro ekdum. Jahan bhejna hai, udhar hi bhej do. Samundar mein phek do"" (Beat up that Tipu. Send him wherever you want to. Throw him in the sea.)Sarma said he had not personally seen the revised textbooks, but if NCERT had made these changes, he welcomed them. A day earlier, RSS leader Sunil Ambekar had claimed that titles like “Akbar the Great” and “Tipu Sultan the Great” had been removed from the books, while stressing that no historical figure had been taken out. The alleged move by NCERT triggered quick political reactions.Congress MP Imran Masood criticised the change, saying it was an attempt to rewrite history and ignore the contributions of rulers who shaped the subcontinent over centuries. He argued that removing titles or names would not change historical facts and pointed to India’s prosperity during parts of their rule.""They ruled the country for 700 years. They didn't rule for just a day or two.You removed their names, but what will the removal or addition achieve? During their rule, GDP was 27 per cent. India was also called the golden bird. They came here and perished here. The last emperor was beheaded, but he did not accept British slavery. He saw his sons' heads adorned on a platter. But he wouldn't accept slavery,"" the Congress MP said.Masood also said those who had “bowed before the British” were now in power, and questioned why descendants of people who “betrayed Rani Lakshmibai” held ministerial posts.Congress leader K Muraleedharan also said the decision to drop the word “Great” from Akbar and Tipu Sultan was unfair. He said Akbar promoted communal harmony and gave Hindus freedom in his rule, while Tipu Sultan fought the British and died because of it.Supporting the revision, VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said past textbooks had “distorted” history. He questioned calling Akbar “great” and said such glorification of Mughal rulers was unacceptable.""How can Akbar be great when Maharana Pratap is great? Are Akbar's misdeeds hidden from anyone? The glorification of Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Aurangzeb cannot be allowed on the sacred land of Maharana Pratap,"" he said, thanking NCERT for the correction.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma backs NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great’ from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.

When Carnatic vocalist Bombay Jayashri Ramnath suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2023, the singer was unable to sit, stand, or move. Involuntary neck and jaw tremors made even speech, an uphill task, forget singing. Traditional physiotherapy, with its repetitive routines, felt painful, monotonous and dispiriting. Recovery seemed distant, and she shut herself from social circles. Then came Jerry — not a real person, but a lively, animated coach inside a virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation program.In one of the games, “Save the Jerry”, set on a sunlit beach, the avatar nudged her to stand up and walk. Through immersive sessions, each small motion made Jerry dance and cheer, turning therapy into play. Other games targeted different challenges — like restoring neck mobility, controlling her left shoulder, or helping her relax and reduce involuntary movements. They were set in storylines featuring forests and snowy mountains, where she rescued birds and gathered fruit for penguins, or prayed peacefully at a temple.“I looked forward to these sessions. Recovery became less about gruelling effort. It was about play, progress, and hope,” said the 60-year-old singer, who has sung in multiple languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, and English.A year later, in Dec 2024, Jayashri, the fourth generation of artistes in her family and trained by legends like Lalgudi Jayaraman and T R Balamani, stood on stage once again, this time to receive the Music Academy’s Sangita Kalanidhi award. “I haven’t done a fullfledged concert yet. But I’ve begun recording again. It may not be this Dec, but I plan to restart my kutcheries (Carnatic concerts) soon,” she said.After undergoing brain surgery in the UK, Jayashri returned to India for therapy. She chose to continue most of her physiotherapy at home. The immersive VR program tapped into neuroplasticity, helping her brain rebuild damaged motor pathways through visual and emotional feedback. “It was slow, but I gradually regained strength, coordination, and confidence. These sessions even encouraged me to perform better in speech therapy, too,” she said.While her therapy included the usual mix of physiotherapy and speech exercises, her therapists gradually increased the time spent on digitally prescribed routines to match her progress. Her physiotherapist, Raja from ReWin, a company using digital therapeutics to enhance rehabilitation, said that unlike conventional physiotherapy, the system integrates a wearable motion sensor that tracks joint movement with precision, eliminating human error.“It also gives us quick, repeatable measurements to monitor progress. Combining this technology with immersive VR creates a powerful tool for lower-limb and gait rehabilitation, allowing patients to visualise and experience leg movements for strengthening neuromuscular pathways,” he added.Physiotherapists point to research showing that engaging in virtual tasks stimulates dopamine release, enhancing motivation and speeding up neural recovery. Dopamine plays a key role in motor memory formation and motivation pathways, which means patients train more effectively and recover faster from neurological injuries. VR and gaming-style immersive tasks activate dopamine-driven reward circuits, improving motor and cognitive outcomes.Digital exercises also allow room for creativity. In one instance, a 66-year-old woman with a frozen shoulder was taken on a virtual journey to the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi. Her therapy involved reaching out to offer digital flowers and rotating her hands during a virtual aarti. These movements were designed to mirror the stretches she needed for recovery, without drawing her attention to the pain. After just one session, she said she felt so much better.“Places of worship are very popular with my patients with Parkinson’s and dementia,” said senior orthopaedic surgeon Dr Thineshchandar Andiappan. “It helps them regain a wide range of hand movements.”Digital exercise prescriptions also ensure continuity of care through remote monitoring, progress tracking and consistent engagement. This is why hospitals and rehabilitation centres are increasingly integrating them into postsurgical routines. Dr Andiappan began briefly using the system a year ago, but has steadily increased its use.“Now patients do about half an hour of digital exercises along with traditional ones. Earlier, it was just 15 minutes of digital and 45 minutes of traditional,” he said. The digital format, he added, improves adherence, affordability and accessibility. “Quality of life improves for most patients. The sensors alert them when movements are incorrect or the range is insufficient. They can correct themselves in real time. ”At least two govt hospitals in Chennai — the Government Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and the National Institute of Ageing — now combine traditional and digital therapy. “We cannot replace traditional exercises. They supplement traditional exercises well. We track patient movement range and make timely corrections, improving outcomes,” said physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist Dr P Thirunavukkarasu. In the private sector, several companies are offering portable, interactive systems for home use, complete with real-time feedback and guided routines — bringing a new dimension to rehabilitation outside the clinic.| Bio-engineers and physiotherapists, using inputs from doctors.

It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance.

Threads of history

Struggles of continuity

In 1946, when Mahatma Gandhi set foot in Sualkuchi, a picturesque village nestled along the Brahmaputra near Guwahati, he was spellbound by the artistry of the local weavers, particularly the women. Their looms seemed to weave not just silk, but dreams, he felt. His words — “Assamese women weave dreams on their looms”, have lingered like the rustle of silk ever since.Nearly eight decades later, those looms are still humming. Sualkuchi remains one of the rare places in India where handlooms, not machines, dictate the rhythm of daily life.While many historic silk weaving centres across India have succumbed to the lure of power looms for economic gain, Sualkuchi, located 35km from Guwahati, remains a bastion of handloom tradition. This steadfast commitment to authenticity is a bequest of the village’s dedication to preserving its cultural heritage. Despite govt’s push for mechanisation in places like Varanasi and Kancheepuram, Sualkuchi’s weavers, supported by their community and loyal customers, have resisted, ensuring that the artistry of handwoven Muga and Pat silk remains untouched by the clatter of machines.This village, with approximately 50,000 people, produces three exquisite varieties of Assam silk — the golden Muga, the warm Eri, and the lustrous Pat — each derived from different silkworms.Within its 8 sq km, 12,000 handlooms work tirelessly, producing around 3 lakh sq m of silk fabric a year, valued at Rs 300 crore. But beyond the numbers lies something more fragile: a cultural identity woven into every strand of yarn. This cottage industry supports nearly 6,000 families, all intricately woven into the fabric of Sualkuchi’s identity.Dr Nihar Ranjan Kalita, an adviser to the Sualkuchi Tat Silpa Unnayan Samiti and principal of SBMS (Sualkuchi Budram Madhab Satradhikar) College, explains that the village’s handloom industry thrives because it is deeply embedded in the local culture. He says that the younger generation, drawn by the allure of fashion and style, actively participates in this age-old craft, ensuring its continuity. “There is societal pressure in Sualkuchi and Assam to keep the textile industry handloombased. The community understands the exquisite value of handloom products.”In Sualkuchi, wearing a mekhela chador (Assam’s traditional two-piece garment) made of Pat and Muga silk is a mark of prestige at weddings and festive gatherings. The village’s commitment to the handloom is so strong that the word “powerloom” is almost taboo, seen as a threat to the originality of their textiles.Kalita, who has explored various textile hubs across India, observes that while other centres focus on exports, Sualkuchi’s products are cherished domestically. This local focus, coupled with govt support for semimechanisation in allied activities, helps maintain the village’s handloom legacy.This guardianship of tradition is not without struggle. In 2013, when powerloom textiles and counterfeit fabrics began flooding the market, threatening to dilute Sualkuchi’s reputation, villagers rose in protest. Their agitation eventually led to the establishment of the Sualkuchi Silk Testing Laboratory. In 2017, its centuries-old weaving tradition earned trademark status. Now, entrepreneurs submit their products in the lab where every piece of silk is tested, certified, and tagged — with a QR code, a 3D hologram and the Silk Mark logo — if they meet the standards.With a quick scan, buyers today can verify a garment’s authenticity, trace its fabric details, and even discover the specific handloom and artisan behind the weave. The trademark seal, ‘Sualkuchi’s’, acts as both a brand and a shield, protecting these handcrafted treasures from counterfeiting.During’s visit to the lab, the staffers were seen conducting three tests to confirm authenticity — burning analysis, microscopic crosssectional examination and chemical verification. The first test involves burning small thread samples to verify silk content; microscopic analysis identifies the specific silk variety, while chemical testing is performed when the first two examinations prove inconclusive.Assam is unique in producing all four recognised silk varieties in India — Muga, Eri, Mulberry, and Tussar. But it is Muga that sets Sualkuchi apart. The distinctive golden yellow silk, exclusive to Assam, comes from the Antheraea assamensis silkworm. It’s valued for its longevity and distinctive lustre.Eri, recognised for its even texture, is used in clothing and household items. In the Mulberry category, despite substantial demand for the yarn, the supply of the locally available Nuni pat variety is insufficient. Weavers often source Mulberry and Tussar yarn, a recent addition to the state’s silk portfolio, from Karnataka (Mulberry), Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal (Tussar).Sualkuchi’s history dates back to the 11th century, when King Dharma Pala of the Pala Dynasty established it as a weavers’ village by relocating 26 weaver families from Tantikuchi in Barpeta. Royal patronage turned the village into a hub of silk weaving. During the 17th century, under Ahom rule, it had become Assam’s primary handloom centre. For centuries, its economy thrived not just on weaving but also on pottery, goldsmithing, and oil pressing — until the 1940s, when only the looms endured.Until 1930, silk weaving was concentrated within Tantipara’s Tanti community. World War II gave Sualkuchi its biggest push, as skyrocketing demand and prices prompted several Tanti families to establish commercial weaving units with hired workers.However, challenges like rising raw material costs, market instability, and limited cocoon availability have pressed Sualkuchi’s weavers hard. “Muga silk products of Sualkuchi have been the most precious. But inadequate supply of cocoons and high prices of yarn have confined the number of households producing Muga textile to about 50,” says Kalyan Kalita, an entrepreneur. “Once, Sualkuchi was known for Muga above all else. Now, few families can afford to produce them. ” The industry has seen shifts: Bodo weavers, mostly women, have returned home after peace talks, reviving traditional skills, and skilled weavers from Bengal found refuge in Sualkuchi post-Covid. This convergence of talent has reinforced the village’s handloom tradition.Weaver Binita Boro reflects on the enduring appeal of the craft: “Handloom cannot die. As a child, I watched my aunt weave dreams here in Sualkuchi. Now, as an adult, I am part of this enchanting village.”","Sualkuchi is a picturesque village nestled along the Brahmaputra near Guwahati. It operates 12,000 handlooms, producing around 3 lakh sq m of silk fabric a year.

MARGAO: Two women’s organisations in Goa have voiced strong opposition to a proposed ‘Tales of Kamasutra & Christmas Celebration’ event on December 25-28 and called on authorities to investigate and block the festival.Goa Women’s Forum (GWF) and Bailancho Ekvott have lodged separate complaints against the event, which they claimed would damage state’s reputation as a familyfriendly tourist destination and promote sex tourism.In a letter to tourism director Kedar Naik, GWF said the event was being promoted by an organisation identifying itself as ‘Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh Foundation’ and allegedly charging participants Rs 25,000 for accommodation and food. “We seek your immediate intervention by filing an FIR, launching a full-fledged investigation to determine the antecedents of this ‘Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh Foundation’ and identifying the venue for this proposed programme. ”Bailancho Ekvott said the event was an abuse of religious freedom and assault on Catholic tradition. “To take the focus away from worship, prayers, this sort of tantrism is uncalled for.” It also said the festival was “a culture crisis for Goan Catholics” and called it a blow to Catholicism in Goa.",Goa Women’s Forum (GWF) and Bailancho Ekvott have lodged separate complaints against the event.

At G20 Summit, PM Modi Proposes Global Knowledge, Skills, Health And Security Initiatives For Future

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said Modi, addressing a G20 meeting in Johannesburg. This comes amid concerns China is leveraging its chokehold over supply of rare and critical minerals to further its strategic goals.“If there is investment in circularity, then dependence on primary mining will be less. This will also reduce the pressure on the supply chain, and it will also be good for nature. This initiative can support joint research, technology standards and pilot recycling facilities in the Global South,” Modi said.Resilience cannot be built in silos, stressed the PM. “The G20 should promote comprehensive strategies that combine nutrition, public health, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness, to create a robust global defence,” he said. PM Modi also suggested a G20 open satellite data partnership saying India believes that the entire humanity should benefit from space technology.“This will make satellite data and analysis of space agencies of G20 countries more accessible, interoperable and usable for countries in the Global South,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

LUCKNOW: Fresh revelations in the probe into the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) module busted in Faridabad have exposed a sophisticated weapons procurement and explosive-manufacturing network involving arrested suspects Dr Muzammil, Dr Shaheen, Dr Adeel and Amir.Investigators said Muzammil purchased a Russian assault rifle for Rs 5 lakh through a contact linked to co-accused Dr Shaheen. The weapon was later recovered from a locker belonging to Dr Adeel, marking a breakthrough in mapping the module's arms routes.Another Russian-origin rifle, an AK Krinkov, along with a Chinese star pistol, a Beretta pistol and nearly 2,900 kg of explosive precursor material, was earlier seized in Faridabad.Also Read | Chilling revelation in Delhi car blast: AK-47 bought for more than Rs 5 lakh, deep freezer used for explosives Officials said Lucknow-based Dr Shaheen arranged for the Russian assault rifles and deep freezer—after discreet negotiations with suppliers to avoid suspicion—on Umar's request and purchases were done by Muzzamil.The agencies are also tracking the suppliers. Overall, Rs 26 lakh was raised by the suspects, majority of the share through Shaheen.The freezer was allegedly used to store temperature-sensitive precursor chemicals essential for fabricating powerful improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Forensic teams are examining the recovered samples to identify the compounds.Intelligence sources said Shaheen not only helped arrange the rifle and freezer but also tapped her network to mobilise funds for the purchase of arms and ammunition. Sources added that the possible links could be through Afirah Bibi, the wife of Jaish commander and Pulwama attack mastermind Umar Farooq.Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish chief Masood Azhar, was killed in an encounter in the wake of the 2019 Pulwama attack that claimed the lives of 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).""The AK-56 recovery from Adeel's locker is a crucial link. It highlights the level of planning, financing and operational readiness of the module,"" an official said.The probe also revealed that Umar had extensively studied bomb-making tutorials, manuals and open-source content online and was given directions by handlers from Turkiye.He allegedly sourced chemical ingredients from Nuh, electronic components from Bhagirath Palace in Delhi and Faridabad's NIT Market and used the freezer to stabilise and process the explosive mixture.Sources added that tensions had erupted between the accused inside Al-Falah University premises over money matters, an altercation witnessed by several students. After the clash, Umar reportedly handed over his red EcoSport—already loaded with explosive material—to Muzammil.","Investigators said Muzammil purchased a Russian assault rifle for Rs 5 lakh through a contact linked to co-accused Dr Shaheen.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

'We Fly For You': Russian Fighter Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

SHIMLA: Wing Commander Namansh Syal, who perished in the Tejas crash at Dubai Air Show on Friday, was a high flyer all his life - house captain in Sainik School, Academy Cadet Adjutant (ACC) at National Defence Academy (NDA), and an instructor with Indian Air Force (IAF), training the next generation of combat pilots.The air warrior will be cremated at his ancestral village, Patialkar, in Kangra district's Nagrota Bagwan tehsil, on Sunday, his father Naib Subedar Jagan Nath (retd), an Army Medical Corps veteran, told TOI. In a tragic twist, the 71-year-old said he was searching for videos of his son's aerial acrobatics at the air show when news reports of the crash popped up. Speaking to TOI over phone from Sulur, the grief-stricken father said, ""Then, officers from my son's squadron arrived to convey the tragic news. ""When the family got the news, Namansh's wife, Wing Commander Afshan, was in Kolkata on a training course. Their six-year-old daughter was with her grandparents in Sulur, where Namansh was serving with No. 3 Squadron.The high-achiever was an inspiration for hundreds not only in his hometown but also his alma mater, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira in Hamirpur district, and NDA. The school held a remembrance meet Saturday.He was part of the school's 21st batch, passing out in 2005. Group Captain Rachna Joshi, the school's principal, said: ""Teachers here tell me he was exceptionally well in academics. Joining the school in Class IX and becoming the captain of Chenab House speaks volumes about him. He will continue to remain in our hearts forever as a braveheart,"" said the principal. His 'home' at NDA - Hunter Squadron - also held a remembrance meet.After his Class XII, Namansh enrolled in National Institute of Technology , Hamirpur, but his heart was set on NDA. After his first semester, he cleared SSB and joined NDA 115th course in 2006. He was appointed academic cadet captain, and commanded NDA's passing-out parade in Nov 2008, earning the President's Silver Medal in overall merit.

NEW DELHI: Lauding the cordial meeting between US President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor Saturday said ""this is how democracy should work and hoped to see this happen in India"". BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla commended Tharoor for his remarks and said he hoped that Rahul Gandhi would get the message.After months of attacks against each other during the high voltage New York City mayoral election, Trump and Mamdani adopted a mutually warm tone during their first meeting at the White House in Washington DC. Reposting on X a video of a media interaction where Trump and Mamdani took questions on their meeting, Tharoor said, ""This is how democracy should work.

G20 Leaders’ Declaration: 'We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations'

PM Modi at G20 Summit





NEW DELHI: The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.In a break from tradition, the world leaders adopted the joint declaration at the start of the summit as opposed to concluding day of discussions. The US boycotted the event due to a diplomatic rift with the host country.The 2025 G20 Leaders’ Declaration in Johannesburg under South Africa's presidency centres on climate ambition, debt relief and development justice, with a strong political message on multilateralism, terrorism and global conflicts. The document “unequivocally” condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, aligning with India’s long‑standing demand that there are no “good” and “bad” terrorists.Leaders reiterated support for an open, fair, inclusive and rules‑based multilateral trading system and call for reform of the WTO to make it more responsive to development concerns. It frames everything under South Africa’s theme of “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability”, with an explicitly pro–Global South tiltAccording to Reuters, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the US objected to the wording of the declaration.However, he emphasised that it could not be “renegotiated.” His remarks underscored growing tensions between Pretoria and Washington.In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa acknowledged the ""overwhelming consensus and agreement for the declaration. He said, ""There's been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the other tasks we should undertake right at the beginning is to adopt our declaration.""Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, noted that the declaration was adopted unusually early in the proceedings, a move driven by the strong support it received. ""Normally, the adoption of the declaration happens right at the end. But there was a sense that we should actually move to have the summit declaration adopted first as the first order of the day,” Magwenya said, according to AP.The South African officials also confirmed that Trump had put pressure on them not to adopt a leaders' declaration in his absence. ""We had the entire year of working towards this adoption, and the past week has been quite intense,"" the spokesperson said.The declaration statement highlights growing global instability driven by geopolitical rivalries, economic fragmentation, and widening inequalities. It stresses the importance of multilateral cooperation as essential to addressing shared global challenges.The declaration also reaffirms commitment to the UN Charter’s principles, calling on all states to avoid the use or threat of force against the sovereignty or territorial integrity of others. It urges nations to promote friendly relations, uphold human rights, and ensure equality irrespective of race, gender, language, or religion.Read Also : G20 Summit: PM Modi proposes 4 big initiatives; focus on healthcare, knowledge and war on drugs It also commits to working for a just and lasting peace in conflict zones such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Ukraine, emphasising that global peace is fundamental to achieving sustainable development and prosperity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a three-day visit to South Africa to attend the G20 summit.

For many observers, the language in the declaration underscored a deliberate effort by participating nations to reaffirm their commitment to climate science despite past US scepticism.","The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.

At G20 Summit, PM Modi Proposes Global Knowledge, Skills, Health And Security Initiatives For Future

PM Modi lauds South Africa’s presidency

In his address at the G20 summit in Johannesburg on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi pitched for sustainable and inclusive growth and made four proposals, including a coordinated global effort to combat the drug-terror nexus, calling drug trafficking a threat to public health, stability and security and a source of terror financing.He pushed for reconsidering the parameters of growth, saying the existing framework has left a vast section of the population deprived of resources and led to overexploitation of nature.Modi, who was instrumental in getting the African Union as a permanent member of G20 at the New Delhi meet of the grouping two years ago, emphasised the continent has suffered the most because of skewed growth priorities. “Today, as Africa hosts G20 Summit for the first time, it is imperative for us to reconsider the parameters of development.”The PM mentioned “integral humanism”, an idea associated with BJP’s ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay, as a path forward. “We will have to look at the individual, society and nature as an integrated whole. Only then can we achieve true harmony between progress and nature,” he said.He proposed creation of a global traditional knowledge repository built on Indian knowledge systems’ initiative, saying this can preserve the collective wisdom of humanity for future generationsBatting for a global healthcare response team to bring together experts from G20 countries, he said it will ensure swift measures in case of health emergencies and natural disasters.The speech was marked by an unabashed advocacy of what Modi called India’s civilisational ethos. India’s civilisational values, he said, can offer ways to reevaluate development parameters.Focusing on Africa, PM said the continent can benefit from skills transfer. He said Africa’s development and empowerment of its young talent are in the interests of the entire world and proposed a ‘G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative’. This can operate under a “train-the-trainers” model across various sectors, and all G20 partners can finance and support this effort, he added.“Our collective goal will be to prepare one million certified trainers in Africa over the next decade. These trainers will, in turn, help equip millions of young people with skills. This initiative will have a powerful multiplier effect. It will strengthen local capacity and significantly contribute to Africa’s long-term development.”Turning his attention to drug trafficking, PM Modi singled out the “rapid spread of highly lethal substances like fentanyl”. “This has emerged as a serious challenge to public health, social stability and global security. It also serves as a significant channel for financing terrorism,” he said.A G20 initiative to counter this global threat can bring together various instruments relating to finance, governance and security. Only then can the drug-terror economy be effectively weakened, he said. Modi lauded South Africa’s presidency for making commendable progress on key areas such as skilled migration, tourism, food security, AI, digital economy, innovation and women’s empowerment, noting that historic initiatives undertaken at the New Delhi G20 Summit have been carried forwardPM Modi on Saturday also proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying that for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said PM Modi. This comes amid concerns China is leveraging its chokehold over supply of rare and critical minerals to further its strategic goals.“If there is investment in circularity, then dependence on primary mining will be less. This will also reduce the pressure on the supply chain, and it will also be good for nature. This initiative can support joint research, technology standards and pilot recycling facilities in the Global South,” PM Modi said.Resilience cannot be built in silos, stressed the PM. “The G20 should promote comprehensive strategies that combine nutrition, public health, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness, to create a robust global defence,” he said.PM Modi suggested a G20 open satellite data partnership saying India believes that the entire humanity should benefit from space technology. “This will make satellite data and analysis of space agencies of G20 countries more accessible, interoperable and usable for countries in the Global South,” he said.",PM Narendra Modi pitched for sustainable and inclusive growth and made four proposals. He called for a coordinated global effort to combat the drug-terror nexus. The speech was marked by an unabashed advocacy of what Modi called India’s civilisational ethos. Modi also proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125511744,imgsize-874511,width-400,resizemode-4/article-64.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Two days prior to taking oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , Justice Surya Kant on Saturday said he does not get pressured by social media trolls, many of whom attempt to misrepresent, misquote or selectively extract court observations to create a negative impression about the judiciary despite having little knowledge of law.In an informal interaction with the media, Justice Kant said, ""I have never been pressured by the campaigns and motivated reporting on social media. I think an overwhelming majority of judges would not be affected by social media trolls as they decide cases based on facts and law.""Outlining his priorities, the CJI-designate said that in his tenure of one year and three months, he would focus on chalking out a strategy, in consultation with stakeholders, to reduce the pendency of 90,000 cases in SC and around 5 crore cases in HCs and district courts. The listing of long-pending bunch cases, whether before 9-Judge, 7-Judge or 5-Judge constitution benches, would get priority as thousands of cases, raising the same or similar questions of law, are pending in various HCs, which have deferred hearing them in anticipation of SC verdicts, he said.One such matter pending adjudication by a 9-Judge bench is the entry of women into Sabarimala temple, mosque and other custom-related religious issues.He said it is a matter of concern that despite SC judges disposing of almost as many cases as are filed every year, the pendency is increasing. Judges cannot be overburdened, whether in SC, HCs or trial courts, he said, adding that some innovative measure must be devised to tackle pendency.Mediation, he said, would be a game-changer in the future and reduce pendency in courts. It is receiving an encouraging response from public sector banks and insurance companies, which are asking the judiciary to train their personnel in mediation to resolve disputes at the pre-litigation stage. ""To use mediation to the fullest extent will be the focal point during my tenure as it is litigant-friendly and cost-effective,"" he said.","Justice Surya Kant said he does not get pressured by social media trolls.

Uranium found in breast milk in 6 Bihar districts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uranium-found-in-breast-milk-in-6-bihar-districts/articleshow/125511777.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The study was carried out by Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Patna, under the leadership of Dr Arun Kumar and Prof Ashok Ghosh, in collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi, led by Dr Ashok Sharma from the department of biochemistry.Conducted between October 2021 and July 2024, the research analysed breast milk from 40 mothers aged 17-35 in Bhojpur, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Katihar and Nalanda.Uranium (U238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/L. There is no permissible limit for uranium in breast milk.Khagaria recorded the highest average contamination, Nalanda the lowest, while Katihar showed the single-highest reading. Nearly 70% of infants faced exposure levels associated with potential non-carcinogenic health risks.Co-author Dr Ashok Sharma of AIIMS said the source of contamination remains unclear. ""We do not yet know the source of the uranium; the Geological Survey of India is also trying to find out. Unfortunately, uranium comes into the food chain and causes cancer, neurological disorders and affects the growth of children - which is a very serious concern,"" Dr Sharma said.Bihar's environmental conditions have compounded the issue. The state's heavy dependence on groundwater for drinking and irrigation, discharge of untreated industrial effluents and long-term use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have already led to contamination with arsenic, lead and mercury in biological samples. The detection of uranium in breast milk signals the contamination has reached the most vulnerable population - infants.Infants are especially vulnerable to uranium because their organs are still developing, they absorb toxic metals more readily and their low body weight amplifies exposure. Uranium can cause kidney damage, neurological impairment, cognitive delays and increase the risk of cancer later in life.Globally, elevated uranium in groundwater has been reported in Canada, the US, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Bangladesh, China, Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Mekong delta. But its presence in breast milk in Bihar takes the problem to a new level.Despite the alarming results, the researchers strongly emphasised that breastfeeding should continue. It remains irreplaceable for immunity and early development, and should be discontinued only on medical advice. With uranium from contaminated groundwater being traced in the most essential nutrition an infant receives, the study calls for urgent biomonitoring, rigorous water-quality testing and immediate public-health intervention.Considering the threat it poses to the most vulnerable of humankind, the research is a call for action.","Uranium (U238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/L.

Tejas Crash: IAF Pilot Killed In Dubai Crash Identified As Wing Commander Namansh Syal

NEW DELHI: India has sent an IAF officer to Dubai to take part in the inquiry to be conducted by the aviation authorities there into the Tejas fighter's crash Friday, with the ill-fated jet's flight data recorder (FDR) or ""black box"" expected to provide key information about the cause of the accident.The IAF officer will be ""a member in attendance"" at the inquiry, as per protocol, into the mishap that saw the single-engine Tejas Mark-1 jet crash into the ground after failing to recover from a ""negative G-turn"" manoeuvre during a low-level aerobatic display at the Dubai Airshow.The mortal remains of the pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal (37), were brought back to Sulur in Tamil Nadu on an IAF C-130J aircraft on Saturday night. ""A dedicated fighter pilot and thorough professional, Wing Commander Syal served the nation with unwavering commitment, exceptional skill and an unyielding sense of duty,"" IAF said.The IAF has not yet grounded its Tejas Mark-1 fighters in the '45 Flying Daggers' Squadron at Sulur and '18 Flying Bullets' Squadron at Naliya for safety technical checks. ""The FDR, which would have recorded all critical flight parameters of the Tejas, such as speed, altitude, control inputs and other such things, will be crucial for reconstructing the sequence of events leading to the accident,"" an officer said.While the exact reason for the crash will be determined by the inquiry, the pilot could have suffered a ""blackout"" or spatial disorientation due to ""negative G-forces"", or there could have been a sudden loss of engine power or control malfunction in the fighter, as was earlier reported by TOI.""Pilots can suffer G-LOC or gravity induced temporary loss of consciousness during sharp turns or dives in supersonic fighters. That is why fighter pilots wear pressurised G-suits to counter the effects of gravity,"" another officer said. The 13.5-tonne multirole Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, has had a stellar flight safety record ever since its first prototype took to the skies in Jan 2001, even as IAF wants a fighter with much better capabilities.Since IAF raised its first Tejas Mark-1 squadron at Sulur in July 2016, the crash at Dubai was only the second after a jet went down near Jaisalmer on Mar 12 last year. While the IAF court of inquiry report into that crash has not been declassified, the cause is attributed to an engine snag. While IAF has inducted 38 Tejas Mark-1 jets, the deliveries of 83 ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A fighters contracted in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore will begin only in March next year, after a long delay. A Rs 66,500 crore contract for another 97 Mark-1A jets was inked with HAL in Sept this year.","IAF officer will be ""a member in attendance"" at the inquiry, as per protocol.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces.

NEW DELHI: An interim inquiry into the Federation Internationale du Sport Universitaire (FISU) World University Games 2025 fiasco has uncovered a disturbing pattern of corruption, nepotism, regional bias, moral misconduct and procedural lapses within Association of Indian Universities (AIU). The lapses - including unauthorised foreign travel, suspicious financial transactions, misuse of authority, biased selections and failures to register qualified athletes - not only embarrassed India internationally but also denied student-athletes crucial competitive opportunities.The four-member committee headed by Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya vice-chancellor Alok Kumar Chakrawal, in its interim report accessed by the TOI, found strong evidence of dereliction of duty and possible financial misconduct by suspended joint secretary (sports) Baljit Singh Sekhon.""There appear to be instances indicative of dereliction of duties, failure to discharge duties, breach of responsibility, nonfeasance, negligence, failure to act,"" the report noted. Multiple unexplained deposits were found in Sekhon's bank account in June 2025 - transactions ""potentially linked to his official capacity.""The committee also flagged conflicting statements regarding who funded his Germany trip.When contacted, Sekhon said since he is under suspension it would not be correct to make any comment. Another suspended official, Gaurav Rai, is accused of facilitating the inclusion of his PhD guide - a yoga expert - in the Indian contingent even though yoga was not part of the Games. He allegedly accepted travel sponsorship from KIIT University without approval, amounting to ""unauthorised financial benefit. "" The committee said ""repeated non-compliance with established protocols... may be construed as gross disobedience, blatant insubordination,"" recommending termination under AIU rules.The report also raised ethical concerns involving former joint secretary, AIU, Binu George Varghese, citing a complaint that he ""shared a twin-room accommodation with a female official"" during the 2023 Chengdu Games - behaviour termed ""a case of moral turpitude."" It further noted that ""officials from the South Zone were disproportionately appointed"" as basketball coaches and managers, indicating ""regional bias"" and ""neglect of national integration principles. "" Varghese didn't respond to calls and text message for his comments. According to AIU sources, the general council on Oct 24, 2025 decided to repatriate Varghese and terminate Rai.The inquiry followed nationwide outrage over India's mishandled participation at WUG 2025 in Germany, where several selected athletes were unable to compete due to administrative lapses.In badminton, six players were barred after only half the names were submitted. India's bronze-winning mixed team had just six of its 12 players on the podium. Athletes across sports called the fiasco ""career sabotage,"" prompting the Sports Authority of India to intervene.Operational failures included a Rs 1,000-per-match fine for jersey violations, no pre-booked practice courts and athletes borrowing shuttlecocks.

NEW DELHI: India has just four palliative-care centres for every 10 million people, leaving millions battling cancer, chronic illnesses and terminal conditions without timely pain relief or support, according to a new study published in cancer journal ecancermedicalscience. It also showed that people often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre, and only 23.7% of the population can access such services within 30 minutes.The study - conducted by the Association for Socially Applicable Research in collaboration with NGO Pallium India - stated that compact territories like Delhi, Chandigarh and Goa fare better due to stronger infrastructure and shorter travel distances. But most large states remain severely underserved, far from the WHO's definition of qualitative palliative care.Lead author of the study, Dr Parth Sharma, said India can achieve near-universal palliative-care access without building new infrastructure. ""If effectively leveraged, the existing public health system can deliver palliative care. Training more healthcare providers would be enough to meet population needs,"" said Sharma.""The study highlights a critical gap in India's healthcare system,"" said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. He said palliative care ""is not an elective addition but the heart of humane, person-centred care"", and called for integrating services into primary health centres, scaling home-based models, expanding specialist training and ensuring district-level access to essential pain medicines.Dr Dinesh Singh, director of radiation oncology, Action Cancer Hospital, Delhi, said the findings expose ""an urgent and deeply concerning gap"", with patients' pain, dignity and quality of life compromised when palliative care is out of reach. He urged expansion of centres, integration of palliative services in all hospitals and strengthening of home-care models.Kerala is the standout model. With only 2.5% of India's population, it hosts 44.5% of all palliative-care centres, giving 94.6% of its people access within 30 minutes.In contrast, Uttar Pradesh has just 12 centres for 17% of India's population, with a median travel time of 111 minutes. In the North-east, mountainous terrain means long travel times even where centres exist.Rural-urban gaps are equally stark, with rural travel times ranging from nine minutes to 591 minutes, underscoring deep inequity. As India's burden of cancer and chronic illness rises, the study warned that geography still decides whether a patient receives comfort - or suffers without care.","People often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre.

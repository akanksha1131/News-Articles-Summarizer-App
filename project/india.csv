"PRAGATI fast-tracks AIIMS push, brings tertiary care closer to heartland",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pragati-fast-tracks-aiims-push-brings-tertiary-care-closer-to-heartland/articleshow/126386860.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Three long-delayed AIIMS projects—in Telangana’s Bibinagar, Assam’s Guwahati and Jammu—have moved decisively from delay to delivery after sustained intervention through the Centre’s PRAGATI platform, underscoring how high-level monitoring is reshaping access to advanced healthcare beyond major metros.Official sources said the projects gathered pace after being taken up on PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation), a digital monitoring platform that brings Union ministries, state governments and local authorities onto a single dashboard, flags bottlenecks in real time and fixes deadlines through direct review by the Prime Minister.In Telangana, AIIMS Bibinagar gained momentum after a PRAGATI review in June 2023 unlocked long-pending issues related to assured water supply and permanent high-tension power. These hurdles were resolved in May 2025 through coordinated Centre–state action, pushing physical progress to nearly 86% and keeping the project on track for completion by June 2026. The institute is expected to emerge as a major hub for tertiary care, medical education and employment in the region.In the Northeast, AIIMS Guwahati—the region’s first AIIMS—was completed in 2023 after PRAGATI interventions helped resolve delays linked to land development, electricity, stormwater management and water supply.The 750-bed hospital now offers 25 specialty and 11 super-specialty services, with nearly 60% of patients receiving free treatment under Ayushman Bharat, significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs for vulnerable households.A similar last-mile push helped AIIMS Jammu overcome hurdles that threatened to delay commissioning despite near-complete construction. Issues such as relocation of a cremation ground and pending utility connections were taken up through PRAGATI in mid-2023, leading to time-bound action by the Union Territory administration. The institute was commissioned in November 2024 and now serves patients across Jammu & Kashmir and neighbouring regions.At the 50th PRAGATI meeting on December 31, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Viksit Bharat@2047 is a time-bound national resolve and described PRAGATI as a key accelerator that breaks bureaucratic silos and enforces accountability across Centre, state and district administrations.Officials said the three AIIMS projects illustrate how PRAGATI has converted complex, multi-agency healthcare infrastructure from stalled works into operational hospitals. Beyond expanding bed capacity, the institutes are strengthening medical education, research and regional employment, easing pressure on existing centres and bringing quality care closer to people’s homes.","Three long-delayed AIIMS projects have moved decisively from delay to delivery after sustained intervention through the Centre’s PRAGATI platform.

Trump 'sir' dials wrong number on India's Apache purchase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-sir-dials-wrong-number-on-indias-apache-purchase/articleshow/126386266.cms,".

Apache AH-64e And Prachand Give India A Two-Front Air Strike Edge From Deserts To High Himalayas





US President Donald Trump pulled another hyperbole out of his MAGA hat on Tuesday, claiming that India had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the United States, the delivery of which was so slow that Prime Minister Narendra Modi deferentially sought a meeting with him to raise concern over the delays.A review of official contracts, delivery records, deployment details and conversations with military and diplomatic sources shows that the claim does not align with facts: India ordered only 28 Apache helicopters in total, and as of December 2025, all of them have been delivered.The discrepancy reinforces a pattern critics have frequently noted in Trump’s public remarks where numbers are often inflated and timelines simplified to emphasise US leverage or personal involvement, like for instance in his persistent claim that he forced India and Pakistan into a truce with threat of tariffs. In this case, while delivery delays were real and did frustrate New Delhi, the scale described by Trump was not; neither was his claim that PM Modi asked “Sir, may I see you, please?” to raise the issue.In Trump’s recalls, everyone – even foreign leaders (except Putin and Xi Jinping) – is always calling him “sir.”India’s acquisition of the Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters took place in two distinct phases, not one massive order.The first deal was signed in September 2015, during the final months of the Obama administration, when India signed an agreement to buy 22 Apaches for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in a contract worth about $2.2 billion. These helicopters were delivered on schedule, with the final units arriving by 2020 during the first Trump administration. They were inducted into two frontline squadrons and quickly became a central part of India’s attack helicopter capability.The second deal was signed in February 2020 during Trump’s visit to India. This follow-on contract, valued between $600 million and $800 million, covered six Apaches for the Indian Army Aviation Corps. This is the order that experienced repeated delays and became a talking point in US and Indian political discussions, including PM Modi flagging it during his visit to the White House in February 2025, one of many topics that were on the agenda. Combined, both deals amount to 28 helicopters—less than half of the figure cited by Trump.While the Air Force’s Apaches arrived on time, delivered at the end of Trump’s first term, the Army’s six helicopters were significantly delayed. Deliveries were initially scheduled to begin in early 2024. Instead, the first batch reached India only in July 2025—about 15 months late. The final three helicopters arrived in December 2025, completing the order nearly two years behind schedule.Several factors contributed to the delays. Boeing’s Apache production line in Mesa, Arizona, was affected by post-pandemic supply chain disruptions, including shortages of engines, gearboxes, and specialised electronics. In addition, India reportedly had a relatively low priority ranking within the US defence priorities and allocations system (DPAS) in 2024, meaning other customers—including the US. Army—were ahead in the queue for certain components.There were also technical and logistical complications. Boeing briefly paused some Apache deliveries worldwide due to electrical and power-generation concerns that required additional safety testing. In a final twist, the last batch bound for India in November 2025 had to turn back mid-flight after Turkey denied overflight clearance to the Antonov-124 transport aircraft carrying the helicopters, adding several more weeks of delay.Also read: 'If they don't help on Russian oil issue...'; Donald Trump's new tariff warning to India; praises PM Modi These genuine frustrations likely form the basis of Trump’s comments, but the numerical exaggeration undermines their credibility. Is it possible that Trump may have conflated two separate Indian helicopter purchases from Boeing: the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter? Both deals were signed around the same time, both involved Boeing (for which Trump claimed to be the all-time best salesman), but they still add up to only 43, since India ordered 15 Chinooks, all of which have been delivered between 2019 and 2020. There is no record in India’s ministry of defence or US foreign, military Sales (FMS) notifications of any additional Apache orders beyond the 28 units. While the Army originally projected a requirement for 39 Apaches, no new contracts have been signed.In fact, despite the Apache’s formidable firepower, India’s experience with dodgy US supply chains issues and increasingly mercurial strategic shifts vis-a-vis China and Pakistan is such that it is now peeling away from American, and for that matter, any foreign dependency. Instead, New Delhi is increasingly prioritising indigenous solutions under its “Make in India” policy. In this case, it is leaning on the HAL Prachand Light Combat Helicopter. A lighter chopper optimized for extreme altitudes, Prachand can operate where the heavier Apache struggles, including at heights above 20,000 feet like in Siachen. India plans to induct 156 Prachand helicopters across the Army and Air Force, gradually reducing reliance on foreign attack helicopters.The emerging strategy is clear: Apaches will remain India’s heavy strike platforms in plains and desert sectors, but the future of India’s rotary-wing combat power will be increasingly domestic. Trump’s claim of 68 helicopters may have overstated the scale, but it has inadvertently highlighted why India is determined to avoid dealing with a maverick.","India ordered only 28 Apache helicopters in total, and as of December 2025, all of them have been delivered.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said the safety of people in Venezuela is India’s primary concern amid the crisis following US military operations in the country and the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.Speaking in Luxembourg, Jaishankar urged all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of Venezuela.“I think we put out a statement yesterday, so I would urge you to look at it. Obviously, what happened—if I can sum up the statement—is that we are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,” Jaishankar said.“We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,” he added.This comes after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country on Saturday in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.Subsequently, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region.

Intellectually disabled woman’s testimony gets rapist 10-year RI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intellectually-disabled-womans-testimony-gets-rapist-10-year-ri/articleshow/126384966.cms,"MUMBAI: Relying on Supreme Court’s observation that the testimony of a person with a disability can’t be considered weak or inferior only because they interact with the world in a different manner, a sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability in 2019, marking a rare conviction under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.Calling the victim a “sterling witness”, judge Surekha A Sinha found the man guilty on multiple counts, including rape under IPC. He was given one year in jail under Section 92(b) of Disabilities Act (assaulting or using force against a person with a disability). The sentences are to run concurrently.Psychiatrists deposed that while the woman was 25 years old physically, her social age was around seven years and two months, with an IQ of 36.According to the prosecution, on April 29, 2019, the survivor’s mother noticed that she had gone missing after the family returned from voting in the Lok Sabha polls. When the woman returned home shortly after, she was in tears and revealed her assault. She said while playing in a nearby lane, the accused caught her hand and forcibly took her to the mezzanine floor of his residence. There, he threatened her with a knife, gagged her with a pillow, and sexually assaulted her.To destroy evidence, she said, the man washed her with soap.During trial, special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma examined 14 witnesses. While forensic reports were inconclusive — a result the prosecution attributed to the accused washing the victim after the assault — medical experts provided critical testimony. Doctors confirmed that the victim had suffered physical trauma consistent with sexual assault.The defence said the case was built on hearsay and cited minor discrepancies in the testimony. The judge rejected these, saying the testimony of a person with a disability must be treated with “utmost sensitivity”. “Minor discrepancies and contradictions are not fatal to the case of prosecution. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable. ”","A sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC denied bail to Gurmukh Singh — son of former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode — and Gurmej Singh in a narco-terrorism case related to smuggling of arms, explosives (including tiffin bombs), and narcotics from Pakistan via drones to fund terror activities in Punjab and other parts of India.A division bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill and Justice Ramesh Kumari said sponsoring terrorism was an “expensive affair” and the charge was of heroin being smuggled into the country, along with arms and ammunition, to fund terror activities.“Facts brought on record by NIA , prima facie, prove the involvement of appellants in terror activities. Trial is in progress. Since they have links with persons across the border, who fund their activities, there are also chances of their absconding from trial,” HC said.

The agency alleged multiple consignments were collected between June and Aug 2021, concealed at locations across Punjab that were shared through encrypted messaging platforms.The agency claimed to have recovered grenades, detonators, pistols, cartridges, explosive materials, large sums of cash, multiple passports, and vehicles from Gurmukh.Gurmukh’s counsel argued he was falsely implicated due to his family background and political reasons, and claimed there was no direct recovery from his possession. NIA asserted that evidence clearly pointed to his role in facilitating terror activities.The agency submitted the appellants were allegedly in contact with Lakhbir Singh Rode alias Baba, a declared terrorist and chief of a banned organisation.","Punjab and Haryana HC denied bail to Gurmukh Singh, son of former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode.

1. Re-introducing tax incentives for the self-employed under the new tax regime can provide a much-needed nudge towards retirement planning.

2.

Formalising retirement savings for gig and platform workers through mandatory contributions deserves priority.

3.

Revisiting the ₹7.5 lakh cap on tax-exempt employer contributions can materially improve retirement adequacy for salaried employees.

4.

Making NPS tie-up mandatory for private sector employers can significantly expand coverage.

5.

Enabling interoperability between EPF and NPS would provide flexibility and empower individual choice.

(Sriram Iyer is Managing Director & CEO, HDFC Pension)

As India aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, one of the most critical yet under-discussed pillars is retirement security. Despite rapid financialisation of household savings, India’s pension assets stand at only about 14% of GDP, significantly lower than comparable economies. The upcoming Union Budget offers an opportunity to accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a ‘pensioned society’ by strengthening and widening the National Pension System (NPS).Nearly 58% of India’s workforce is self-employed, as per the Economic Survey 2024-25. Unlike salaried employees—who benefit from EPF, corporate NPS and superannuation—the self-employed largely remain outside formal retirement systems. Section 80CCD(1B), which allowed an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS contributions, acted as a strong behavioural trigger for this segment under the old tax regime. Its absence in the new tax regime has diluted that incentive.Re-introducing 80CCD(1B) under the new regime, with a higher limit of up to ₹1.2 lakh annually, would encourage early participation in retirement savings.Global experience shows that upfront tax incentives play a decisive role in driving adoption of long-term products like pensions. Over time, this would reduce old-age dependency and fiscal pressures on the State.India’s gig workforce—estimated at nearly 1 crore today and projected to reach 2.35 crore by 2029-30 —represents a fast-growing but vulnerable segment. While the Code on Social Security, 2020 recognises gig and platform workers and provides for insurance and health benefits, structured retirement savings remain absent.A modest mandatory contribution of 2–3% by digital platforms into NPS can meaningfully address this gap. Given the nature of gig work, voluntary retirement savings often take a back seat to immediate income needs. A default, system-driven contribution mechanism would help these workers build a long-term corpus without affecting their day-to-day liquidity. This step would also align well with the Government’s broader inclusion and social security agenda.Currently, the combined employer contribution to EPF, superannuation and NPS is capped at ₹7.5 lakh per annum. In practice, a significant portion of this limit is consumed by EPF and superannuation, leaving limited headroom for NPS contributions - even though NPS allows up to 14% of basic salary as employer contribution. As a result, senior management and key decision-makers often find NPS less attractive, which in turn affects adoption across organisations.Removing NPS from this overall cap—or creating a separate sub-limit for NPS—would enhance retirement replacement rates, potentially increasing them to around 65% when combined with other retirement instruments. This would also encourage leadership within corporates to actively champion NPS adoption.While EPF is mandatory, NPS remains optional, despite its low cost, transparency and market-linked returns. Today, only about 21,000 corporates offer employer NPS, compared to nearly 8 lakh establishments registered with EPFO. Making NPS tie-up mandatory for companies above a certain workforce threshold - say, 100 employees - would substantially widen coverage among private sector employees. A blended approach combining EPF, superannuation and NPS can meaningfully enhance long-term retirement outcomes, while still preserving choice and diversification.India’s workforce is young, mobile and increasingly financially aware. While EPF offers fixed returns and capital protection, NPS provides market-linked growth, low costs and the flexibility to customize asset allocation based on age and risk appetite. Although policy intent to allow tax-neutral transfers from recognised provident funds to NPS was articulated earlier, operational enablement - especially for EPF - remains incomplete.Allowing seamless, tax-neutral transfers between EPF and NPS would give employees the freedom to design retirement solutions aligned to their life stage and financial goals, while also channelising long-term savings into productive capital formation.The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda. Targeted tax incentives, inclusion of emerging workforce segments, rationalisation of contribution limits, and greater system flexibility can collectively deepen NPS adoption. These measures would not only strengthen household financial resilience but also support long-term capital formation-creating a virtuous cycle for both citizens and the economy.",The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

Thackeray brothers unite

Natural allies

Both Sena (UBT) and MNS are “natural allies”. They derive their political legacy from the Shiv Sena, founded by the late Bal Thackeray, which was rooted in Marathi identity. Since then, the emotive issue of Marathi pride has remained central to both parties.

Since launching the MNS in 2006, Raj Thackeray has leaned heavily on an anti-North India stance as his political trademark. Uddhav, meanwhile, has championed the “Marathi manoos” narrative to advance his agenda.

Both parties performed poorly in the Assembly elections held in 2024. Ahead of the local body elections, the issue of Marathi identity—through opposition to the imposition of Hindi—has given both parties renewed energy to ignite Marathi pride among voters.

‘Pawar’ alliance

NCP (SP) to join NDA?

Will MVA disintegrate?

Who won the last local body elections?

Who dominated municipal council polls?

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in Maharashtra are scheduled for January 15. These elections were long overdue because of legal battles.According to the Maharashtra Election Commission, polls for these corporations were held on different dates between 2015 and 2018. Elections for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which governs Mumbai, and 17 other major cities were last held in 2017. Five municipal corporations, including Vasai-Virar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli, went to the polls in 2015, while four others — Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad — had elected their mayors in 2018.Interestingly, many tectonic shifts were witnessed in the run-up to the elections. While the Thackeray and Pawar families ironed out alliances, many corporators from various parties jumped ship just ahead of the polls.The BMC has a budget of more than Rs 74,000 crore -- larger than the GDP of many states in the country and several countries across the world.Geographically, Mumbai, along with its suburbs, Pune and Nashik do not even constitute one-fourth of Maharashtra’s total area.However, this region is significant because of its wealth and the industries it hosts. Therefore, the corporations in these areas are highly important for political parties.It is thus inevitable that these elections become testing grounds for parties and alliances. The Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are the main contenders, but regional and smaller parties are also in the fray and determined to make their presence felt at the local level of urban governance.The BJP and Shiv Sena , constituents of the Mahayuti, are contesting 137 and 90 seats, respectively. The third Mahayuti ally, the NCP , is fighting independently and has fielded 94 candidates, meaning the party will take on its state-level partners in nearly 100 seats if no nominations are withdrawn.Meanwhile, Congress has put up 143 candidates, while its new ally, the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), led by former MP Prakash Ambedkar, has fielded 42 contestants even though it was allotted 62 seats in a pre-poll pact with the national party.The Rashtriya Samaj Paksh (RSP), a Congress ally, has fielded six candidates.The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is contesting over 150 seats, the NCP (SP) 11, and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) the rest.In the upcoming elections, the Thackeray brothers - Uddhav and Raj Thackeray - have decided to join hands after 20 years and are contesting the elections on the plank of “Maratha pride”.“We will make sure that Marathi people get what they want,” Raj Thackeray said while announcing the alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.Meanwhile, the Ajit Pawar-led NCP also announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.The announcement, however, came with a rider -- the decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, and family patriarch Sharad Pawar was not involved in the decision-making process.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, split from his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objections to Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his age.Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar’s faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol. Sharad Pawar’s faction, NCP (SP), adopted the ‘tutari’ (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, Ajit Pawar’s NCP increased its tally from just six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha elections to 41 MLAs, defeating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head contests; the latter won seven.During the campaign, Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Shirsat floated speculation over the possibility of the NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.He said that local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.“In the coming future, there is a possibility that Sharad Pawar could join the NDA. Did anyone believe that he would join hands with Uddhav Thackeray? But he did, and they were in power for two-and-a-half years,” Shirsat said.“He opposed Sonia Gandhi and left the Congress, and then immediately made an alliance with them. It would not be surprising if he joins the NDA. If you study politics, this has been his career pattern,” he added.The coming together of the Thackeray brothers and the senior and junior Pawars signals a silent end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) -- the opposition front that Uddhav Thackeray formed with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP in 2019 to keep the BJP out of power after the assembly elections.The opposition coalition performed strongly in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 of the 48 seats in the state. The glory, however, was short-lived as the MVA was decimated in the Assembly elections held later in the year, collectively winning only 46 of the 288 seats.In the run-up to the local body polls, the Congress has been left out of alliances after it refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray’s MNS, given his aggressive “outsiders” pitch against north Indians.The grand old party, which had earlier asserted it would contest the January 15 polls solo on all 227 wards, has now joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar-led VBA, allocating it 62 seats.Apart from the VBA, the Congress has allocated 10 seats to the RSP and two to the Republican Party of India (Gavai faction), unsettling functionaries of the party’s city unit, leaders said.The Congress move to chart its own course in Maharashtra is a bold gambit. The party, which had a fairly strong presence in state politics till 2009, has since seen its electoral fortunes decline.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Congress won only 16 of the 101 seats it contested. Its vote share stood at 12.42% — the lowest for the party in Maharashtra, though still higher than all other players except the BJP.However, this solo fight pits the Congress directly against the BJP, which has been the undisputed winner in recent electoral contests. The move also divides the opposition space in the civic polls, giving the BJP-led Mahayuti an advantage.The last elections in the municipal corporations were largely dominated by the BJP and the Shiv Sena, which formed governments in 15 municipal corporations, including Mumbai and Thane.The BJP secured a majority in 13 corporations on its own, including Pune, Jalgaon, Mira-Bhayandar, Nagpur and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The Shiv Sena achieved a majority in its stronghold, Thane. In Mumbai, they ruled as partners until the tenure ended in 2022.The BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra’s civic elections, winning presidents’ posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats.The BJP emerged as the biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, while the MVA was reduced to 44 posts.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, the Congress checked the BJP's advances in parts of Vidarbha. Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as the Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground.Meanwhile, the BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. The Shinde-led Sena expanded its footprint beyond the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.","The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in Maharashtra are scheduled for January 15.

NEW DELHI: Linking the mounting trade tensions between India and United States with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the CIA-led operation, Maharashtra's former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday asked: ""Will Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?""Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.""With a 50 percent tariff, trade is simply not possible. In effect, this amounts to blocking India–US trade, especially exports from India to the United States. Since a direct ban cannot be imposed, tariffs have been used as a tool to stop trade. India will have to bear this,"" Chavan said in an interview to news agency IANS.He further said: ""The profits that our people earlier earned from exports to the US will no longer be available. We will have to look for alternative markets, and efforts in that direction are already under way"".""The question then is: What next? Will something like what happened in Venezuela happen in India? Will Mr. Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?"" Chavan asked.Criticising Chavan over his remark, BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: Congress sinks to a new low every day. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan shamelessly comparing India’s situation with Venezuela. By asking whether “what happened in Venezuela can happen in India”, Congress is making its anti-India mindset clear. Rahul Gandhi wants chaos in Bharat. Rahul Gandhi is seeking foreign intervention in Bharat’s affairs!""Earlier in the day, Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.However, the ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense after the US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically... PM Modi's a very good man. He's a good guy. He knew I was not happy. It was important to make me happy. They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly...""Trump was referring to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, a point his administration has repeatedly opposed, and which he had cited as the basis for doubling tariffs on India to 50% in August 2025.India is already facing the 50% tariff imposed by Trump, who has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s ties with Moscow and has alleged India of strengthening Russia in the Ukraine war by purchasing Russian crude.",Prithviraj Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.

‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it has both the power and constitutional competence to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, arguing that it is duty-bound to ensure that no foreigners are included in voter lists.The submissions were made by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the EC, before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.The bench resumed final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the EC’s decision to undertake the SIR exercise in several states, including Bihar. The petitions raise constitutional questions on the scope of the poll panel’s powers, citizenship, and the right to vote.Dwivedi argued that the Constitution makes citizenship a foundational requirement for holding public office. Citing provisions such as Article 124(3), which governs the appointment of Supreme Court and high court judges, he said all key constitutional functionaries across the three organs of the State must be Indian citizens.He added that citizenship is also a prerequisite for holding offices such as president, vice president and prime minister.“All vital appointments ... no appointments can be made unless the person is a citizen, so our Constitution is citizen-centric predominantly,” Dwivedi said, according to news agency PTI.Referring to the constitutional scheme, he said, “The (constitutional) article, when it says citizens, that is something which has to be inquired by the competent authority. What should be the nature, summary etc., that is a different question.... There is a constitutional duty to ensure that on the electoral roll, there should not be any foreigners.”Dwivedi told the court that the Election Commission cannot be expected to respond to political rhetoric.“I am not commenting on the political parties, as the Election Commission, our duty is that no foreigner should be there.... It is to be seen that the power is there and the competence is there,” he said.Resuming his arguments, Dwivedi framed what he described as the central constitutional issue: whether Article 324, which grants the EC powers of superintendence, direction and control over elections, is completely displaced by statutory provisions or whether its application must be examined on a case-by-case basis.He submitted that Articles 324, 325 and 326 of the Constitution, read together with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, do not bar the EC from exercising its authority in revising electoral rolls.“The field is not totally foreclosed,” he said, asserting that the Commission retains constitutional competence to ensure the purity of voter lists.Tracing the evolution of voting rights, Dwivedi took the bench through colonial-era electoral practices, beginning with the introduction of separate communal electorates in 1909 and the limited franchise under the Government of India Acts, when only about 15 per cent of the population had voting rights. He argued that the expansion of the franchise was a central goal of India’s freedom struggle.“Not only Article 326, but the entire Constitution, when it speaks of a democratic republic, reflects an intention to create a citizen-centric polity,” he said.Addressing concerns that the SIR exercise could resemble a parallel citizenship determination similar to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Dwivedi stressed that the two serve fundamentally different purposes.“The NRC includes all persons, whereas the electoral roll includes only citizens above the age of 18,” he said, adding that persons of unsound mind or otherwise disqualified are also excluded from voter lists.“On the face of it, the electoral roll is not like the NRC,” he said, reiterating that Article 326 permits only citizens to vote and that citizenship must be determined by a competent authority.Even if “10 or thousands” of foreigners are found on the electoral rolls, they must be removed, Dwivedi said, clarifying that the EC is not making political judgments but fulfilling its constitutional obligation.The senior advocate is scheduled to resume his arguments on Thursday, January 8.Earlier, the bench had questioned whether the EC is barred from conducting inquiries in cases of doubtful citizenship and whether such an inquisitorial process falls outside its constitutional mandate.","The Supreme Court resumes final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the EC’s decision to undertake the SIR exercise.

NEW DELHI: The road transport and highways has given its “in-principle” approval for the Atal Progress-way, also known as the Chambal Expressway. The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad). After major modification in the alignment, the environment clearances have been obtained. The project will benefit aspirational (backward) regions in all the three states,” said an official.The access-controlled corridor will connect Kota in Rajasthan with Etawah in UP and cities in MP, including Morena and Bhind. This will reduce both travel time from 10-11 hours at present, to only 5-6 hoursOfficials said the corridor will also provide connectivity to Agra-Jhansi, Kota-Jhansi-Kanpur and Agra-Kanpur highways. They added that the corridor is envisioned as a critical infrastructure aimed at improving connectivity and facilitating faster movement of goods and passengers across the region.","Road transport and highways has given its ‘in-principle’ approval for the Atal Progress-way.

Snow, orchards, birds



-- the timeless line, attributed by many to Amir Khusrau and famously used by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, resurfaces each winter as Kashmir enters its harshest yet most enchanting period -- Chillai Kalan. And as the Valley embraces this 40-day stretch of biting cold, this Persian phrase feels more fitting.Snow-laden rooftops of the houses, frost-crusted deodar and chinar trees, Kashmiris in pherans with smoky kangris tucked insde, the Valley transforms into a scenic postcard during Chillai Kalan. Srinagar 's Jewel -- Dal Lake freezes around the edges, its shikaras scraping gently through thin sheets of ice, while cracks form over the vast span of Wular Lake in Bandipora. Migratory birds flee frostbitten homelands in Siberia, China, and Central Asia, to find refuge in Kashmir's wetlands, adding life to its winter quiet.As 2026 begins, the grandeur of the Kashmir Valley is in the grip of Chillaii-Kalan, a 40-day spell of the harshest, and the most defining phase of winter, the region experiences each year.Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: Chillai Kalan, Chillai Khurd, and Chillai Bachha.It begins with the 40-day Chillai Kalan (December 21–January 31), the harshest period of cold. This is followed by the 20-day Chillai Khurd (January 31–February 19), or ""small cold,"" and concludes with the 10-day Chillai Bachha (February 20–March 2), or ""baby cold.""Each phase brings biting temperatures, snowfall, and frozen rivers and lakes, playing a vital role in replenishing the Valley’s water resources.The Valley takes on a new dimension of beauty under a pristine blanket of snow, with green meadows, apple orchards, and winding highways to the upper reaches of the Great Himalayas and Pir Panjal range all dusted in white.Kashmir, already one of the world's most sought-after tourist destinations, becomes even more captivating during this period. Travel enthusiasts flock to witness fresh snowfall, feel the intense winter chill, and listen to the rustle of icy winds whipping through the mountains, adding a dramatic rhythm to the serene landscape.Winter is traditionally Kashmir's most dramatic season, but this year, the Valley is witnessing a remarkable inflow of visitors. Gulmarg has been reporting almost 100% occupancy, with the Tourism Department lining up events across Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Pahalgam and Dodhpathri to meet demand.Hotels across Srinagar, Pahalgam and Gulmarg are filled for the first time in months.Altaf Ahmad, a hotel general manager in Gulmarg, told IANS: ""We are completely sold out this time.""For many locals, this winter is not just a season but the opening of opportunities to earn livelihood as Kashmir sees heavy footfall of tourists during this time.A resort owner in Pahalgam, Taufique Butt, reflects on Chillai Kalan and describes it in Kashmiri.His resort, like others in the scenic town of Pahalgam and on the banks of Lidder River, has no vacant rooms left.""Sir, the situation here is quite overwhelming. Tourists from all over India are coming to see the snow… All our hotels, resorts, and lodges are overbooked. People are arriving with online pre-bookings.""The scars of last April's terror attack in Baisaran briefly dented the tourist flow, he said, especially around Pahalgam. But Aru, Betaab and Chandanwari — the ABC of Pahalgam, which are key destinations soon triggered visitors returning in large numbers.Fresh snowfall after the New Year renewed excitement, particularly at Aru and Betaab Valley, known to many as the filming sites of Bajrangi Bhaijaan.Ujjwal Kant, visiting from Sonepur in Bihar, had just returned from skiing and gondola rides in Gulmarg when he described the mystical mornings of Chillai Kalan:He added: ""I actually came hoping to experience Chillai Kalan, and it's been unforgettable… frozen streams, quiet valleys, and almost postcard-like mornings. We had to modify our plans a bit because roads open late and highways saw traffic jam, yet that hasn't stopped tourists.""For Kashmiris, Chillai Kalan or intense winter is as much about survival as celebration. The season's snowfall replenishes the high-altitude water reservoirs that feed rivers of the Valley -- Jhelum, Indus, Chenab etc, streams and lakes through summer. This makes the daily life and survival challenging.Snow after January 30 melts too fast to serve this purpose, which is why the first snowfall of Chillai Kalan is greeted like a festival.Srinagar resident and shawl seller Shafique Chaudhary says the season brings a special kind of joy.""Chillai Kalan has really tightened its grip this year. Daily routines slow down because mornings are painfully cold and water lines freeze often. But people here are used to adjusting — we layer up, start work later, and rely more on kangris.:He added, ""The harsh cold also brings a certain calm to the city, something only winter in Kashmir can create.""He described the familiar winter scene: pherans, kangris, streets filled with bundled-up locals, and constant cups of kahwa and noon chai keeping people going.Gulfam Beigh, a Shikara operator on Dal Lake, captures the essence of winter in Srinagar through the eyes of both locals and visitors.He said, ""Chillai Kalan means fewer hours on the water because parts of Dal Lake start icing up early. But tourists still come for the experience. They’re fascinated by the thin ice sheets along the edges.""""Work is tougher -- hands go numb quickly -- yet this season has its own magic. The quietness of winter draws serious travellers,"" he added.Anantnag-based driver Mohammad Zaheer feels the winter both helps and challenges him: ""For us drivers, Chillai Kalan is both a challenge and a boost… Roads are slippery in the mornings… But tourist pickups have increased because they want to explore snow spots.""He added, ""Business stays steady, though we spend more on heaters and maintenance. The cold tests everyone, but it also brings visitors who appreciate Kashmir's winter charm.""As the bone-chilling winter descends upon the Himalayas and the 40-day Chillai Kalan grips Jammu and Kashmir , ANI sources in the defence establishment said the Army has stepped-up counterterror actions across Kishtwar and Doda districts, just south of the Valley.Undeterred by freezing temperatures, treacherous terrain, and heavy snowfall, Army units have expanded into higher, snowbound areas to pursue Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment.""This winter marks a decisive shift in operational approach,"" said a source. ""Instead of reducing activities, the Army has adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.""A key feature of this year’s counter-terror strategy is the integrated approach. The Army is leading a synchronized effort with multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the Civil Administration, Jammu and Kashmir Police, CRPF, SOG, Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards. ""This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution,"" the source added.Intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully analysed to map terrorist movements and hideouts. Once verified, coordinated operations are launched, minimising overlaps and maximising impact. About 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists are currently in the Jammu region, and intelligence suggests they have shifted to higher and mid-mountain areas, now largely uninhabited. ""These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection,"" the source said.Reports indicate remnants of these groups are attempting to coerce villagers for shelter and food, but their local support has sharply declined. Continuous security vigilance and isolation have restricted their ability to regroup or plan attacks.The Army in this winter is focused on two goals -- eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and ensure they remain limited and restricted to inhospitable high-altitude areas. ""Security forces have launched concurrent operations along valleys, mid-altitude regions, and high ridges to maintain overlapping control and deny any potential movement corridor,"" said the source. Each operation is followed by sustained surveillance, forming the ""surveillance-sweep-surveillance"" cycle, the cornerstone of the Army's new winter doctrine.Snowbound terrain makes the whole task of Army operation challenging, and it requires specialised training and equipment also. ""The Indian Army has deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat,"" the ANI source said. These troops have been crucial in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.Snowfall during Chillai Kalan delivers essential ""chilling hours"" that sustain Kashmir’s apple orchards, a backbone of its economy.And with its lakes freezing at the edges and wetlands opening up, the Valley has recorded a huge influx of migratory birds this winter, escaping harsher climates elsewhere.","Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: Chillai Kalan, Chillai Khurd, and Chillai Bachha. The Valley takes on a new dimension of beauty under a pristine blanket of snow.

NEW DELHI: The budget for 2026-27 is likely to be presented on February 1, the first, in recent memory, to be presented on a Sunday.The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech. Though the final call on the date will be taken by the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs (CCPA) on Wednesday, TOI has learnt that govt may continue with the tradition of presenting the budget on February 1.Since 2017, govt has been presenting the budget at 11 am on February 1 and former FM Arun Jaitley had unveiled it for the first time on the first day of Feb after govt decided to advance the budget presentation. Prior to 2017, the budget was presented on February 28.This year Feb 1 falls on a Sunday. It is also Guru Ravidas Jayanti, a restricted holiday. Being a holiday, govt offices and the stock markets are closed on Sunday.People aware of the development said that the Economic Survey would be presented on January 29. The next two days — January 30 and 31 — would be holidays. The first part of the budget session is likely to be for three weeks and the second part will last for four weeks.In 2025, February 1 fell on a Saturday and govt presented the interim budget that day. The Union budget had been presented on a Saturday before too, including in 1999 when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who read out the budget on February 27, a Saturday. This also marked the beginning of budget speech at 11 am instead of 5 pm, a departure from colonial practice.The 2026-27 budget is keenly awaited as it comes at a time of geopolitical tensions and under the shadow of Trump’s tariffs. Government is expected to unleash reform measures to shield growth and the country’s standing as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world .They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt’s focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth against the backdrop of global challenges.TOI has also learnt that getting rid of the “mentality of slavery” and the thrust on “reform, perform and transform” are likely to be the central themes of the President’s address at the joint sitting of Parliament on Jan 28. Different ministries have been asked to give their inputs based on these themes for the President’s speech.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the govt since August 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” PM Modi had said.","The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech.

Ambala man arrested for allegedly spying on Air Force; under investigation



NEW DELHI: In two separate cases of alleged espionage reported within 24 hours, authorities in Punjab and Haryana have arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pathankot and a contractor from Ambala for allegedly sharing sensitive defence-related information with Pakistan-linked handlers. Police in both states said the accused were in contact with individuals across the border and had passed on details connected to key security installations.A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI , terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers, Punjab Police said on Tuesday.Police identified the juvenile as Sanjeev Kumar . According to officials, he was tricked by Pakistani handlers on social media. Police said he believed that his father had been murdered, which made him emotionally vulnerable.SSP Pathankot Daljinder Singh Dhillon said, ""The police have arrested Sanjeev Kumar, aged 15, after receiving information that he had been supplying information related to the security of our nation to the frontal organisations of terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers.""He added that the boy was drawn in by Pakistani accounts online.""He fell into the trap of Pakistani agencies through social media, as he was suspicious that his father had been murdered, which affected him mentally. However, the investigation did not reveal any such evidence,"" Dhillon said.According to police, Sanjeev had sent videos of several sensitive locations and had been in contact with gangsters based in Pakistan who run terror modules. ""He had been in contact with Pakistan’s terror organisations for almost a year,"" the SSP said.Police are investigating how much information he shared and who he was in contact with. The boy is currently in custody, and further action will be taken based on the investigation.In an another incident in neighbouring state -- Haryana, another man in Ambala was held for allegedly spying on Air Force, as confirmed by DSP Crime on Tuesday.DSP Crime Virendra Kumar said the accused, Sunil alias Sunny, had been a contractor handling repair work at an Air Force station since 2020.“The police had information that he was providing details about our defence area, specifically the Air Force. His mobile was seized and several suspicious things emerged from it,” Kumar said.The officer added that Sunil had been in contact with a woman who allegedly asked for information, which he passed on. “According to his device, he used to send information to a neighbouring country, which we can call an enemy country. But this is his version. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.Sunil is married with two children and is currently on four days of remand.

NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.","Supreme Court held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part.

NEW DELHI: Over 9,000 birds across 131 species were spotted along Yamuna floodplains in the capital during the Asian Waterbird Census this weekend.The survey, carried out by a group of nearly 20 birders in collaboration with eBird, an online avian database, flagged several ecological threats to the habitat, including illegal sand mining on the floodplains, predation by stray dogs, dumping of construction and demolition debris as well as plastic waste along the river.Four teams of birders surveyed a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage. Black-headed gulls (2,500) dominated the count, followed by 1,700 barn swallows. Pied avocet (136), ruddy shelduck (112), white wagtail (108) and house sparrow (90) were also spotted.The birders highlighted habitat degradation of these birds because of removal of aquatic reeds, cultivation on the riverbed and open burning of waste along the bank. They also flagged declining water quality of the river because of sewage and agrochemical runoff.Pankaj Gupta, Delhi-NCR project coordinator of Asian Waterbird Census eBird, said, ""If the condition of Yamuna floodplains is not improved, there is likely to be a decline in the number of waterbirds in future.""Akash Gulalia, director of Amaltas Nature Walks, said that the river ecosystem faces a massive threat due to increasing agricultural land on the riverbed and rampant use of chemical fertiliser in them.""Cutting and clearing of aquatic and riparian vegetation has left little space for these birds to breed. Illegal mining is another major issue,"" said Gulalia.Apart from Yamuna floodplains, the birders will carry out surveys in smaller wetlands in north Delhi, including Rohini, later this month. Sultanpur, Chandu, Jhanjrola, Bhindawas, Dhigal, Mandothi, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur, Dhanuari and Dadri wetlands will also be covered.The census is coordinated by Wetlands International, a global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources, and is carried out in several countries every January.","Four teams of birders surveyed a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after Supreme Court’s Vishaka judgment mandating a mechanism against the sexual harassment of women at workplaces, it remains unimplemented by many high courts, including Calcutta, Patna, Orissa, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Allahabad and Uttarakhand.Appearing for PIL petitioner Geeta Rani, senior advocate Sonia Mathur told SC that, significantly, district courts in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, too, do not have any such mechanism. The bench sought status reports from registrar generals of the defaulting HCs, and bar associations and bar councils all over the country.The petitioner told the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the absence of a gender-sensitised complaint-handling structure in many courts, bar associations and tribunals results in serious constitutional violations and discourages women from fully participating in the justice delivery process.“In several courts across the country, there is either no established internal redressal mechanism, or the mechanism is not duly notified, accessible or functional. Information about complaint procedures, responsible authorities, or grievance redressal channels is often unavailable or opaque,” she said. “Sensitisation and awareness among court administration, judicial staff, security personnel and lawyers also remain inadequate.This systemic deficiency exposes women to an unsafe environment and undermines their constitutional guarantees,” the petitioner said.In the Vishaka judgment in 1997, Supreme Court had laid down mandatory guidelines requiring all institutions, including courts, to establish mechanisms for prevention and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace, recognising women’s right to equality, dignity and a safe work environment under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. In 2013, SC, in the Medha Kotwal Lele case, had reaffirmed and strengthened the Vishaka guidelines, and directed all institutions to ensure effective, independent and accessible complaint mechanisms to safeguard women’s rights at workplaces. In 2015, SC had constituted the Gender Sensitisation and Internal Complaints Committee for protection of female lawyers, employees, interns and litigants within court premises.The petitioner said, “The absence of similar mechanisms in HCs, district courts and tribunals results in unequal treatment of women lawyers across judicial Institutions and hence, violates Article 14. A constitutional standard available within SC must be replicated for every court of justice in the country.”","Nearly three decades after Supreme Court’s Vishaka judgment mandating a mechanism against the sexual harassment of women at workplaces, it remains unimplemented by many high courts.

NEW DELHI: Conceding that its two-decade-long intervention to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR had failed to achieve desired results, Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to identify all major sources of pollution in two weeks and suggest long-term sectoral action plans to tackle each of them in a phased manner.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi attributed the failure to loosen the grip of pollution over Delhi-NCR to the court heeding myriad and divergent individual suggestions of experts.

Right to speedy trial irrespective of nature of offence: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/right-to-speedy-trial-irrespective-of-nature-of-offence-supreme-court-grants-bail-to-amtek-chairmanin-jail-for-16-months/articleshow/126384415.cms,"‘Really Happy For Others’: SC Rejects Umar Khalid’S Bail; Partner Shares His Reaction

If state can’t ensure speedy trial, don’t oppose bail plea: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: A day after Supreme Court rejected the bail plea of activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam by holding that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be the sole ground to grant relief, another bench of the court on Tuesday held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial and it is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.It said delay in trial is a valid ground to grant bail and granted relief to former Amtek Group chairperson Arvind Dham who has been in jail for the last 16 months in a money laundering case.“The right to speedy trial, enshrined under Article 21 of Constitution, is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence,” said a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe. It said SC had in multiple cases invoked long incarceration to grant bail when the jail period ranged from 3-17 months.Prolonged incarceration of an undertrial, without commencement or reasonable progress of trial, cannot be countenanced, as it has the effect of converting pretrial detention into form of punishment,” said the SC bench.Though Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, who have spent almost six years in jail, are being prosecuted for terror acts under UAPA, the bail provisions — under Section 43D(5) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act — are similar.Both say an accused cannot be released on bail if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true and condition is imposed under the accused to demonstrate prima facie innocence.The court’s order granting bail to former Amtek Group chairperson Arvind Dham is in contradiction to the order passed while rejecting the bail plea of the student activists but it is in conformity with orders passed by SC earlier, including in cases of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and TN minister Senthil Balaji. It shows inconsistency in the approach of the apex court.Allowing the plea of Dham, the bench said gravity of offence is one of the factors which is to be considered while deciding bail but said that statutory restrictions (as provided under PMLA, UAPA) cannot be permitted to result in indefinite pretrial detention in violation of Article 21.“It is well settled that if the State or any prosecuting agency including, the court, concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused, to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime,” it said.“The aforesaid proposition was quoted with approval by another two-judge bench of this court and it was held that long period of incarceration for around 17 months and the trial not even having commenced, the appellant in that case has been deprived of his right to speedy trial,” the court added.The bench noted that there was no likelihood of trial being concluded in near future as there are 210 witnesses to be examined in the proceeding. “There is no likelihood of trial commencing in the near future. The continued incarceration in such circumstances, particularly where the evidence which is primarily documentary in nature, is already in custody of the prosecution, violates the right of the appellant to speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” it said.While allowing bail plea of UAPA accused K A Najeeb, alleged to be a member of banned PFI, Chief Justice Surya Kant, who was part of a three-judge bench and penned the judgment, had said Section 43D(5) of UAPA per se did not oust the ability of constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights of accused.","A day after Supreme Court rejected the bail plea of activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, another bench of the court on Tuesday held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial.

Have authority to assess voter’s citizenship: Election Commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-authority-to-assess-voters-citizenship-election-commission/articleshow/126384392.cms,"Effort to ensure no foreigner is included in electoral rolls : EC



NEW DELHI: Election Commission told Supreme Court Tuesday that the Constitution has cast the authority and duty on it to assess a person’s Indian citizenship prior to inclusion in the electoral roll to ensure foreigners do not vote.Arguing before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, repudiated petitioners’ assertion that determination of citizenship did not fall within the remit of the commission, and hence, only Aadhaar details would suffice for inclusion in the voters’ list during SIR in various states.Dwivedi traced the history of the “assessment of India citizenship” of voters for inclusion in electoral rolls to the Constituent Assembly debates and said the framers of the Constitution had unequivocally mandated EC to ensure that only Indian citizens were registered as voters.“It is evident that from its inception, the Constituent Assembly intended that authorities responsible for preparation of electoral rolls would enquire into citizenship and exclude those who were not citizens from the electoral rolls of constituencies, and later, EC was vested with plenary powers with respect to superintendence, direction, and control over all elections, as well as the power to verify the status of citizenship under Article 324 read with Article 326,” he said.Dwivedi said the Constitution is citizen-centric, and hence, insists that every elected representative and the heads of the three governing organs are citizens of India. It does not matter whether SIR detects one or hundreds of foreigners on state electoral rolls, he said and added that effort is to ensure no foreigner is included.On the validity of SIR, the counsel said elections cannot be free and fair unless electoral rolls are intensively revised from time to time. He said Article 324 of the Constitution envisaging “superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls” included the constitutional mandate to revise the voters’ lists, particularly before general elections. “The nature of the revisional exercise is left to the discretion of EC and would depend upon the prevalent circumstances,” Dwivedi said, adding that intensive revision of electoral rolls would consider death and migration, and inclusion of new voters.Countering petitioners’ plea that only the Centre was entitled to inquire into citizenship, Dwivedi said, “The commission’s power to assess citizenship flows from Articles 324 and 326 of the Constitutions, read with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act 1950.”He said the Union govt alone had the power to terminate citizenship or declare someone as a foreigner. However, EC can exclude a person from the voters’ list on finding him to be not a citizen of India, he added. “Under the SIR exercise, the citizenship of an individual for the purposes of Citizenship Act, 1955 will not terminate on account of the fact that s/he is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,” Dwivedi said.“In so far as the burden to prove citizenship is concerned, the necessary documents required to establish citizenship are within the special knowledge of the individual claiming to be a citizen of India,” EC said, thus casting the burden on the person seeking his inclusion in the electoral roll to prove his citizenship. Arguments would continue Thursday.","Election Commission: Constitution has cast authority and duty on it to assess a person’s Indian citizenship prior to inclusion in the electoral roll.

NEW DELHI: About 2.9 crore electors, making up 18.7% of Uttar Pradesh’s 15.4 crore electorate as it stood at the launch of special intensive revision (SIR) in the state on Oct 27, 2025, have been struck off the state’s draft electoral roll published on Tuesday.UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors; while deleting 46.2 lakh (2.99%) on account of being deceased; 2.17 crore (14.1%) for having permanently shifted or found untraceable or absent during visits by the booth level officers (BLOs); and 25.5 lakh (1.6%) for being enrolled at multiple places.Sources further indicated that while the percentage of electors found permanently shifted from their polling areas in UP is around 8.4%, those marked as untraceable or absent are over 5.1%. An official said the higher rate of permanently shifted electors in UP (8.4%), as compared to Bihar (4.6%) may not be surprising, citing a Down to Earth survey from 2021 that put the overall migration rate for UP at around 28.4% as against 14.2% for Bihar. District-wise draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show that Lucknow recorded the highest rate of deletions of permanently shifted electors (13.4%), followed by Ghaziabad (12.7%) and Meerut (11.6%).As per district-wise draft voter lists, the percentage of overall deletions in 22 of UP's 75 districts exceeds the state's average 18.7% deletions. These districts include Lucknow (with over 30% deletions), Ghaziabad (28.8%), Balrampur (almost 26%) and Kanpur Nagar (25.5%); the exclusions in the four districts amount to more than one-fourth of their total electorate as it stood on Oct 27, 2025. Meerut has recorded the least deletions at 9.9%, followed by Hamirpur at 10.8%. A study of deletions however shows no pattern on lines like the religious composition of districts or proximity to the international border.A statement put out by the UP chief electoral officer (CEO) on Tuesday explained that the BLOs did not find the ‘deleted’ electors or did not get back their enumeration forms because they “have shifted permanently to somewhere else from their previous place of residence; were found missing or absent from the concerned polling area, or somehow did not submit the form, till Dec 26, 2025”.The statement however added that genuine electors excluded from the draft roll can still be added back during the claims and objection period from Jan 6 to Feb 6, 2026 by filling up Form-6 along with the declaration form and submitting relevant documents to prove their eligibility.“The name of the electors found enrolled at multiple places in electoral rolls will be retained only at one place,” said the UP CEO.The notice period, covering hearings and verification, will stretch from Jan 6 to Feb 27, 2026, followed by publication of the final electoral roll of the state on March 6, 2026.Electors wanting to check the names in UP draft electoral roll may refer to the copy available with local BLO or visit the ECINet app or website of the UP CEO or ECI.Meanwhile, young electors who have attained 18 years of age on or before 01.01.2026 are being encouraged to apply through Form-6 along with the prescribed declaration form and relevant documents. So far 15.8 lakh Form 6 (with or without declaration) have been collected across UP for inclusion of new electors.Booth-level lists of electors reported as deceased, permanently migrated, untraceable, or whose forms were not received have already been shared with the parties’ booth level agents (BLAs) for verification. Printed and digital booth-wise copies have been provided to all recognised parties and also made available on the CEO’s website.The entire election machinery, supported by volunteers, is assisting electors, particularly senior citizens, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups.As per Para 5(b) of SIR guidelines, no name shall be deleted from the draft roll without notice and a speaking order by the electoral registration officer (ERO)/Assistant ERO. Any aggrieved elector may seek redressal through a two-stage appeal process, first by approaching the district magistrate and finally the state CEO.EC on Tuesday reiterated “its firm commitment to a transparent, participative and inclusive revision process, ensuring that no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible name remains in the electoral roll”.EC is undertaking SIR exercise in UP, along with others 11 states/UTs covered in Phase 2. ""with full transparency at every stage of the process,” said a spokesperson.A total of 12.5 crore of UP’s 15.4 crore of electors submitted their enumeration forms till the last date of enumeration period i.e., 26.12.2025 “reflecting an overwhelming participation in the first leg of SIR,” UP CEO office said on Tuesday.It attributed the successful completion of enumeration phase to the coordinated efforts of district election officers (DEOs) of all 75 districts, 403 EROs, 2,042 AEROs (AEROs) and BLOs deployed at over 1.6 lakh polling booths, supported by volunteers. Field representatives of all recognised political parties, including their district presidents and 5.7 lakh BLAs, also played their part.To ensure universal awareness and participation during the enumeration period, the state CEO, DEOs and EROs conducted extensive awareness campaigns and held multiple meetings with political parties to explain the process and share the progress updates. BLOs conducted booth-level meetings with BLAs, who were allowed to file up to 50 enumeration forms per day to ensure their active involvement in SIR.BLOs carried out house-to-house visits to all electors whose names were in the electoral roll as on 27.10.2025 to distribute enumeration forms, followed by at least three visits for collection.",UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors.

NEW DELHI: To enhance civil-military cooperation and improve the quality of life in remote border areas, the Indian Army has constructed a 10-KW solar power plant in north Sikkim and a water storage facility in Arunachal Pradesh.“Trishakti Corps of the Indian Army has established a 10-KW solar power plant at Muguthang village, North Sikkim”, located at an altitude of around 15,000 feet near the China border, an official statement said. “Reliable electricity has enabled year-round habitation and improved safety in this remote border village,” it said.Muguthang is a sparsely populated border village with 32 residents from 10 families. The plant has improved night-time safety, enhancing connectivity and eliminating the need for seasonal migration during the harsh winter months. Earlier, due to the absence of a dependable power supply, villagers relied on small personal solar panels and were compelled to migrate to other areas for nearly 5-6 months every year, leaving behind their homes and livestock.In Arunachal Pradesh, Army troops from Spear Corps have constructed a log hut with water storage facility at Ojugo village in Taksing, Upper Subansiri district.The newly constructed facility will provide essential shelter and assured water availability. “The initiative under Operation Sadbhavana ensures basic amenities in remote areas, benefiting local villagers and graziers,” Spear Corps posted on X.Also, the Army on Monday flagged off an eco-tourism exposure tour from Along Military Station, Arunachal, marking a significant step towards youth empowerment and sustainable development in the border regions.Prior to the tour, a comprehensive three-day homestay and eco-tourism training capsule was conducted at Aalo, during which 30 students and two instructors were familiarised with the fundamentals of community-based tourism, responsible travel practices, and the economic potential of eco-tourism in Arunachal.In Manipur, Red Shield Division under SpearCorps inaugurated a textile unit and Yarn Bank at Nungkot, empowering Kom women weavers through skill training and livelihood support. A visit to IDP Camp Lamlai was also organised and raw material for handloom and tailoring units were distributed.","The Indian Army has constructed a 10-KW solar power plant in north Sikkim and a water storage facility in Arunachal Pradesh.

Amid growing demand for a CBI probe into the 2022 Rishikesh resort murder case, in which a 19-year-old receptionist was allegedly killed under mysterious circumstances, CM Pushkar Dhami Tuesday said his govt was open to “all forms of probe” to get answers. The incident had triggered massive protests across Uttarakhand at the time. Dhami said he would also meet the woman’s parents and discuss the matter with them.Calling the case “extremely heartbreaking and sensitive”, Dhami said sentiments of entire state were connected to the case. “Being the CM, I will meet them. After examining all legal aspects, whatever they say regarding justice for their daughter will be followed”.The CM said those involved in the crime would not be spared. “Earlier, it was due to a probe by SIT that three accused were sentenced to life. Some audio recordings have recently come to the fore. We have formed an SIT to probe the matter and the ex-MLA and others whose names have surfaced must cooperate. Instead of remaining on the run, those who made allegations should appear before police so the truth can come out,” he said.Not ruling out a “planned political conspiracy” behind the latest row, Dhami said a similar audio leak had surfaced during the exam paper leak issue. “Hue and cry was created then too. Now another audio leak is being used to spoil the environment of Uttarakhand,” he said, taking a swipe at Congress netas for trying to revive their political careers through the case.Questioning circumstances surrounding the clips, Dhami said it was suspicious that the phone was switched off after releasing the audio and a presser was held in Delhi though the matter pertained to Uttarakhand. He said police and social media records confirmed that the party in-charge named in one audio did not visit Uttarakhand during the period mentioned.Cops tried to approach those levelling fresh allegations and pasted notices at their houses, but they continue to avoid sleuths, he said.Police in Haridwar have constituted an SIT to probe the audio involving a woman, Urmila Sanawar, whose allegations have led to the political storm. The row escalated after several audio clips were allegedly released by Urmila, in which expelled former BJP MLA Suresh Rathore was purportedly referring to a “VIP” who he alleged was a senior BJP neta. It was insinuated that the “VIP” had visited the resort and “sought favours” from the receptionist.Rathore later denied allegations, claiming that the clips were “AI-generated”.","Ankita Bhandari, 19, was allegedly killed under mysterious circumstances.

KOLKATA: A primary school on the outskirts of Kolkata, which received Rs 12 lakh from Venezuela when Hugo Chavez was president, held a special prayer Tuesday for peace and stability in the country that was plunged into uncertainty following US’ capture and detention of Chavez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, along with his wife Cilia Flores.Led by headmaster Sandip Baidya, around 30 students of Bagu Junior Basic School in Rajarhat joined the morning prayer and gathered around a portrait of Chavez.“Our students know his (Chavez’s) name and have heard the name of his country but they are not very well informed about what is happening there. We held a prayer for the people of Venezuela, from whom we once received generous funds for the school’s development,” Baidya said. The headmaster gave a short speech before the assembly observed a minute’s silence.On March 6, 2005, the-then Left Front govt arranged the visit of Chavez — a socialist leader — to the school to showcase successful implementation of midday meal scheme in rural Bengal. Impressed by what he saw, Chavez approved a grant of Rs 12 lakh for Bagu Junior Basic School on his return to Venezuela, a country he governed from 1999 till 2013.The cheque arrived in 2007.The school spent a part of the money to add two rooms — one on the ground floor and the other on the first — and the rest to fill a small pond in front of the building for the children’s safety. Baidya said a Venezuelan govt representative visited the school in 2020 to review the work undertaken with the money they sent.All the teachers and other employees who were at the school during Chavez’s visit have since retired, except Kalyani Mandal, who cooks midday meal. Now in her late 60s, Mandal remembers what she, her mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law had prepared that day: “We had cooked rice, dal and sabji, and boiled eggs. The guest (Chavez) served the meal to the children. There was a huge crowd. People from other villages had come to see him. ”","Bagu Junior Basic School in Rajarhat, West Bengal, received Rs 12 lakh from Venezuela when Hugo Chavez was president.

Kushwahas’ fate uncertain as 3 of 4 party MLAs ‘revolt’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kushwahas-fate-uncertain-as-3-of-4-party-mlas-revolt/articleshow/126384242.cms,"PM Modi Reveals Why NDA Swept Bihar, Says Emotional Mode And 24x7 Development Win Elections In India

PATNA: The fate of Bihar’s panchayati raj minister Deepak Prakash hangs in the balance as Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), founded and led by his father and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha, looks set to split with three of the four party legislators likely to stake claim over the organisation as part of the NDA.The three MLAs — Rameshwar Mahto, Madhav Anand and Alok Kumar Singh — are reportedly angry with Kushwaha for making his son a minister despite his not being a member of either House of the state’s bicameral legislature.If that happens, neither BJP nor Janata Dal United — the two major NDA partners — will make Deepak an MLC, which he needs to become within six months to continue as a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet.Everyone was surprised when Kushwaha, whose Rajya Sabha membership expires in April, named his son, Deepak, as a minister from RLM quota instead of wife and Sasaram MLA Snehlata. If RLM indeed splits, prospects of another Rajya Sabha term for Kushwaha may also dim. Five Bihar seats in the Lower House are falling vacant in April.Bajpatti MLA Rameshwar Mahto said, “The decision to make Deepak a minister was wrong. We hoped Kushwaha would see reason, but in vain. The three of us are together but have not decided our next step — whether to leave the party or not — yet.”Madhav Anand, who is MLA from Madhubani, told TOI on phone from Delhi that RLM was united.“We will sit and discuss things if there is any resentment,” he said.The three MLAs had skipped the recent “litti party” hosted by Kushwaha and preferred to meet Nitin Nabin the same day after his appointment as BJP national working president. Mahto was unsparing when reminded that Kushwaha made his son minister “to keep the party united”, as he had said.“CM Nitish Kumar is my mentor, who always believes in doing what he says. I came with Kushwaha for his stand against dynastic politics. I could never imagine that he is floating the party for ‘Parivar’ politics. I have a roaring business and do politics to serve the poor, not for ‘parivar’. Party workers have hopes from their representatives... I started a charitable trust hospital for the poor soon after election,” Mahto said.However, RLM chief spokesman Ram Pukar Sinha said the party is united and everyone is working hard to make it stronger.Kushwaha, who had earlier founded RLSP which he later merged with JDU, served as Union minister of state for education in the first Modi govt from 2014-2019. Since then, he or his party has had little success till the Nov 2025 Bihar assembly election in which RLM managed to win four seats.","Deepak Prakash's fate hangs in the balance as Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) looks set to split.

Uttar Pradesh cuts duty for commercial assets transfer via gift deeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttar-pradesh-cuts-duty-for-commercial-assets-transfer-via-gift-deeds/articleshow/126384230.cms,"LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved transfer of commercial and industrial properties among family members through gift deeds at a concessional stamp duty capped at Rs 5,000. Earlier, this concession, introduced in Aug 2023, applied only to agricultural and residential properties.Stamp and registration minister Ravindra Jaiswal said that under Indian Stamp Act, 1899, gift deeds for immovable property were traditionally charged stamp duty based on value of the property, similar to conveyance deeds, while registration under the Registration Act, 1908, was mandatory.“Before 2022, gift deeds among family members attracted stamp duty equivalent to the full circle rate. A notification issued on August 3, 2023, capped stamp duty at Rs 5,000 for gift deeds within families, but this relief was restricted to agricultural and residential properties,” Jaiswal said.Calling it major relief, Jaiswal said the cabinet has now extended the concession to commercial and industrial properties, making intra-family transfers affordable, transparent and legally streamlined.The revised rules will take effect from the date of publication in the official gazette.","The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved transfer of commercial and industrial properties among family members through gift deeds at a concessional stamp duty capped at Rs 5,000.

Early trends show BJP leading



What did the exit polls predict?



How many seats each party is contesting?



NEW DELHI: As vote counting commenced at 8am on Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party took an early lead crossing the majority mark, followed by the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress, as per poll trends.Key AAP leaders, including party chief Arvind Kejriwal (New Delhi), CM Atishi (Kalkaji), and Manish Sisodia (Jangpura), were trailing in their respective constituencies. Congress candidates Sandeep Dikshit (New Delhi) and Alka Lamba (Kalkaji) also lagged behind.Meanwhile, BJP's Kapil Mishra (Karawal Nagar) and Parvesh Verma (New Delhi) were leading as per early poll trends.The Election Commission of India began the counting of votes on 70 seats for the Delhi assembly elections 2025 at 8am on Saturday.The battle for the next government is primarily seen as a contest between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been in the opposition since 1998.However, the Congress could shake up the equation with unexpected surprises, potentially altering the political dynamics.Bharatiya Janata Party was leading, followed by Aam Aadmi Party and then Congress, the early trends showed.AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, who is contesting from New Delhi constituency, CM Atishi from Kalkaji and Manish Sisodia from Jangpura were trailing in their respective seats.Congress's Sandeep Dikshit from New Delhi seat and Alka Lamba from Kalkaji are also trailing as per the early poll trends.Further, BJP's Kapil Mishra from Karawal Nagar and Parvesh Verma from New Delhi are leading.Most exit polls have predicted a tight race, with the BJP holding a slight edge in both seat count and vote share.In 2013, AAP formed the government with Congress's outside support after winning 28 seats, but the tenure lasted only 49 days.The 2015 elections saw AAP secure a landslide victory, claiming 67 out of 70 seats. In 2020, the party retained power with 62 seats, while the BJP won the remaining eight. Congress, once again, failed to secure a single seat.AAP and Congress each have fielded 70 candidates, whereas, BJP has contested 68 seats, leaving two for its allies—Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).In total, 699 candidates entered the fray, including 603 men, 95 women, and one third-gender contestant. Voter turnout stood at 60.5%, with 9,451,997 of 15,614,000 electors casting their votes on February 5.","The Election Commission of India began the counting of votes on 70 seats for the Delhi assembly elections 2025 at 8am on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: In a special briefing by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Friday, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overseas visit, foreign secretary Vikram Misri responded to a query about the extradition of Tahawwur Rana from the US.During the briefing, foreign secretary Misri said, ""On the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, from recent developments, you would be aware that Mr Rana has exhausted all legal avenues in the United States with the US Supreme Court also dismissing his appeal and therefore we are now in touch with US authorities to work on the logistics of his surrender to Indian authorities"".He added, ""We will update you as soon as we hear further on this particular matter"".The developments comes ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States.""The visit will be a valuable opportunity to engage the new administration on all areas of mutual interest"", Misri said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also mentioned that PM Modi and US President Donald Trump would hold bilateral meetings in both restricted and delegation-level formats, with senior US administration figures expected to meet the prime minister during the visit.""The fact that the Prime Minister has been invited to visit the US within barely three weeks of the new administration taking office shows the importance of the India-US partnership and is also reflective of the bipartisan support, that this partnership enjoys in the US,"" he added.Earlier, during a press briefing, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said that the Indian side was working with the US on procedural issues for the early extradition of Tahawwur Rana to India.You would have seen that on January 21, the US Supreme Court declined a petition from the accused.

The petition, filed in November 2024, was against an earlier order of a lower court that had ruled in favor of his extradition. A writ of certiorari is a legal document that allows a higher court to review a case from a lower court.The 26/11 attacks resulted in the deaths of 174 people, including 20 security personnel and 26 foreigners, and over 300 others were injured in the horrific attacks that took place at Mumbai's Taj Hotel on November 26, 2008.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana, convicted for his role in the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, may now be extradited to India.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

A historic moment for Delhi



The results for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are set to be announced on Saturday, February 8, marking a pivotal moment in the Capital's political landscape. The election, held in a single phase on February 5, saw over 15 million eligible voters casting their ballots across 70 Assembly constituencies.A total of 699 candidates, including 603 male and 96 female contenders, vied for the electorate's mandate.The stakes are high as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) seeks a fourth consecutive term, while the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP ) aims to reclaim power after nearly 27 years. The Congress , once a dominant force in Delhi politics, is hoping to regain some lost ground.The counting process will be conducted under strict security and transparency measures. 5,000 personnel have been deployed to ensure a smooth and fair counting process.The Returning Officer (RO) in each constituency will oversee the process, which includes the counting of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips.Five VVPATs from each constituency will be randomly selected for verification to ensure accuracy.In case of a tie, the winner is decided by a draw of lots. A recount can be demanded by a polling agent if irregularities are suspected.The election has seen high-profile contests in several constituencies, with prominent leaders from AAP, BJP, and Congress locking horns:Exit polls have painted a mixed picture, with most predicting a BJP victory after nearly three decades. However, some projections suggest a close contest between the BJP and AAP, while the Congress is expected to play a minor role.A party needs 36 seats to form a majority in the 70-member Delhi Assembly. The BJP, which last governed Delhi in 1998, is projected to emerge as the single largest party, while AAP is expected to face a significant setback. The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years until 2013, is hoping to recover from its dismal performance in the last two elections, where it failed to win a single seat.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a crucial test for both AAP and BJP. AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, has been in power since 2015, winning 67 seats in 2015 and 62 seats in 2020. A victory would solidify Kejriwal's position as Delhi's leader and boost his national political profile. However, exit polls suggest that AAP may fall short of a majority, with the BJP poised to make a comeback.The BJP, under the leadership of Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva , has campaigned aggressively, focusing on issues like pollution, water shortages, and infrastructure. The party has also accused AAP of corruption and mismanagement, while AAP has blamed the central government for obstructing its work.The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has attempted to revive its fortunes by highlighting issues like the Yamuna water crisis and corruption allegations against AAP. However, the party's prospects remain bleak, with most exit polls predicting a marginal presence in the Assembly.The election has been marred by controversies, with AAP accusing the BJP of attempting to poach its candidates by offering Rs 15 crore and a ministerial position. Delhi’s Lt Governor VK Saxena has ordered an anti-corruption branch probe into the allegations. The BJP, in turn, has demanded that AAP retract its accusations or face legal action.A loss in Delhi could weaken AAP's position in other states like Punjab, Gujarat, and Goa.The party's national ambitions may suffer a setback, with its focus likely to shift back to Delhi.A victory for the AAP will establish Kejriwal's dominance in Delhi and enhance his political stature nationally.A victory would mark the BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years, ending AAP's dominance.The party's success in Delhi could bolster its position ahead of assembly elections in Bihar and ther states.A loss in Delhi will prove to be a major morale buster as heavyweight leaders like PM Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath campaigned extensively across the Capital.The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years in a row till 2013, is striving to stage a comeback after failing to win a single seat in the previous two elections. An improvement in its performance could provide a much-needed morale boost.The party may use AAP's potential loss to regain its foothold in Delhi and other states.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a historic moment for the capital, with the potential to reshape its political landscape. As the counting of votes begins on February 8, all eyes will be on the results to see whether AAP can secure a fourth term or if the BJP will make a triumphant comeback. The Congress, though a minor player, will be hoping to stage a revival. Whatever the outcome, the results will have far-reaching implications for the future of Delhi and Indian politics.","Exit polls suggest that AAP may fall short of a majority, with the BJP poised to make a comeback.

Exit poll track record: A look back



2013: Underestimating AAP's rise



2015: A landslide that no poll saw coming



2020: Polls more accurate, but still off the mark



NEW DELHI: With only two days between voting and results, debates over exit polls heated-up as two more surveys were released on Thursday, echoing earlier predictions. Aam Aadmi Party , however, dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls were released on Wednesday shortly after voting concluded in Delhi. They largely predicted a BJP comeback in the capital after 27 years, dealing a major setback to AAP, which has ruled for over a decade and remains a strong political force.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta cited past election trends, emphasising that exit polls had misjudged the party’s success in 2013, 2015, and 2020. ""Every time, AAP was predicted to win fewer seats than it actually did,"" she said. Senior leader Sanjay Singh went further, ridiculing the projections as ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""Kejriwal said in his post on X: ""These predictions are meant to shape political sentiment and weaken our party by causing defections.""Moreover, majority of pollsters have missed the mark in recent elections, including the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and state assembly elections in Haryana, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra.Exit polls in 2013 largely favoured the BJP, predicting an average of 35 seats—just short of a majority—while forecasting 17 each for AAP and Congress The actual results, however, saw AAP win 28 seats, BJP 32, and Congress just 8.The closest prediction came from Today’s Chanakya, which estimated AAP would win 31 seats. The party, propelled by the India Against Corruption movement, formed a short-lived government with Congress support before resigning over the Jan Lokpal Bill after 48-days of assuming power.Six exit polls in 2015 forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp its scale. While the average prediction gave AAP 45 seats, the party stunned observers by winning 67.BJP scored just 3, and Congress was left with no legislators in the assembly.The highest estimate for AAP came from Axis My India at 53 seats, while India TV-CVoter predicted only 39. Most polls also overestimated BJP’s chances, with many projecting over 20 seats.By 2020, exit polls were more aligned with AAP’s dominance but still fell short of the final numbers. On average, they predicted 52 seats for AAP and 17 for BJP, while the actual results saw AAP win 62 and BJP secure 8. Congress, once again, failed to win a single seat.India Today-Axis My India provided the closest estimate, forecasting 59-68 seats for AAP. Meanwhile, Sudarshan News gave BJP its highest projected tally at 24-28 seats, though the party ultimately fell far below that mark.","Aam Aadmi Party dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.

All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation.

""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network.

Responding to the post, Dr Karpagam challenged the notion that dairy products are vegetarian.“Also, paneer and milk are not 'veg.' They are animal source foods ... same like chicken, fish, beef, and all,” she wrote on X.The thali in question included a mix of vegetables such as cucumber, carrots, and onions, alongside paneer, coconut, and dal.Her comment sparked a divided response. Many X users argued that since milk and paneer are derived without killing the animal, they remain vegetarian. Others, however, claimed that labeling dairy as vegetarian was influenced by Western dietary classifications.“No one is killed… to eat paneer or milk,” one X user pointed out.Another user explained, “Milk products are animal products that no animal has to be killed to get, hence it is indeed vegetarian & not vegan. Any killing or harm to animals happens in the milking setup. ‘Veg’ means vegetarian.”In response, Dr Karpagam asked, “So why are eggs not 'veg'?”—a counterpoint that further fueled the debate.","Dr Sylvia Karpagam, working editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, questioned the classification of milk and paneer as vegetarian foods.

We are going to bring some information about the election. We studied the details - the voters and the voting list. Our teams have been working, and we have found many irregularities.""Highlighting the numbers, the Congress leader alleged that while 32 lakh voters were added over five years between the 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, a 39 lakh voters were included in the rolls within just five months between the Lok Sabha elections and the Vidhan Sabha elections.""The question is, who are these 39 lakh voters? That is equivalent to the total number of voters of Himachal Pradesh. The second point is, why are there more voters in Maharashtra than the entire voting population of the state? Somehow, the voters have been suddenly created in Maharashtra,"" he alleged.Rahul further accused the Election Commission of ignoring repeated requests to investigate the anomalies. ""We have been saying to the Election Commission that we are finding anomalies. We need the voter list—names and addresses of the voters of Maharashtra.

The development comes a day ahead of the counting of votes in Delhi.The visit by ACB officials follows a directive from Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena, who ordered a probe into Kejriwal’s claims. The move came after the BJP wrote to the LG, demanding an investigation and an FIR, calling the allegations made by the AAP chief “very serious in nature.”Earlier, Arvind Kejriwal accused the BJP of attempting to poach 16 AAP candidates by offering them ministerial positions and Rs 15 crore each if they defected.AAP MP Sanjay Singh, reacting to the ACB’s visit, said, “More than 16 people have been threatened. We have disclosed one phone number. We are going to file a complaint at the ACB office. Why is the ACB creating drama instead of taking action? All details will be revealed during the investigation.”The probe was initiated after the Delhi LG’s principal secretary wrote to the chief secretary, directing an ACB inquiry into AAP’s allegations.Meanwhile, AAP legal head Sanjeev Nasiar said that ACB officials left from Arvind Kejriwal's residence. He said, ""When the ACB team came here, they didn't have a notice, but after taking instructions from someone, they have served us a notice. We will reply to the notice in a proper way.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have predicted an end to the 10-year rule of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi with most of the pollsters giving BJP a majority in the February 5 elections. If these predictions hold true on February 8 when the votes are counted, it would mark BJP's return to power in the national capital after 27 long years.While the BJP helped by its NDA allies went all out to woo Delhi voters, the INDIA bloc was divided in this fight with allies AAP and Congress turning bitter rivals for this high-stakes battle.The campaign saw Congress and AAP target each other fiercely. Arvind Kejriwal all along alleged that the Congress was contesting these elections to help the BJP, while the grand old party questioned AAP's decade-long governance in the national capital.Congress, once a dominant political force in Delhi with a government under Sheila Dikshit’s leadership for 15 years, has lost much of its traditional voter base to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Kejriwal, emerging from the India Against Corruption movement, won 28 seats in AAP’s 2013 debut outing. Much of these gains were made at the cost of the Congress. In 2015, AAP surged to a sweeping victory, claiming 67 seats and leaving Congress with no representation in the assembly.With the two parties contesting as rivals, a key question remains: Will a potential split between AAP and Congress pave the way for a BJP victory or Will AAP manage to ensure consolidation of Muslim and Dalit votes to block the BJP’s path again? Notably, the BJP has not fielded any Muslim candidate in Delhi.All eyes are now on the final results, which will be announced on February 8. Here's a look at how the fight between AAP and Congress could possibly help the BJP in some Delhi seats.In the last election, AAP had secured a strong lead in all 12 SC-reserved constituencies, leaving BJP trailing while Congress struggled to remain competitive.Right through the 2025 campaign, Rahul Gandhi made a strong pitch for greater representation of Dalits, backward communities, and tribals - the target groups which were traditionally with the Congress but had shifted to AAP in the last two elections.If Gandhi's caste-focused rhetoric attracts significant support from the targeted groups, potentially dividing the vote share between AAP and Congress, it could alter the result - especially in seats where margin of victory was slim. It could ultimately tip the scales in favor of the BJP.In Bawana, AAP won by 11,526 votes, while Sultan Pur Majra saw one of the biggest For instance, in Bawana (SC), Congress trailed AAP by only 11,526 votes, while in Sultan Pur Majra (SC), Congress was behind by a significant 48,052 votes. Mangol Puri (SC) also saw a close race, with Congress trailing by 30,116 votes. Similarly, in Karol Bagh (SC), Congress was behind by 31,760 votes, and in Patel Nagar (SC), the gap was 30,935 votes. In areas like Seemapuri (SC) and Gokalpur (SC), Congress had a narrow disadvantage of 56,108 votes and 19,488 votes, respectively.There are 12 seats with a strong Muslim voter base; historically, these voters have not been aligned with the BJP, making AAP and Congress their likely alternatives. Whether these votes consolidate or split could determine the final outcome of this high-stakes election.The voter turnout in Muslim-majority constituencies for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections showed high participation.Seelampur recorded a high turnout of 68.70%, with a turnout close to Mustafabad, which had the highest turnout in northeast Delhi at 69%. Other constituencies with notable turnout include Sultanpur Majra (SC-reserved) at 68.30%, and Babarpur at 66%, which ranked well in northeast Delhi.Seelampur, with 57% Muslim voters, was once a Congress stronghold but was won by AAP in 2015 and 2020. This time, AAP’s Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad is contesting against Congress's Abdul Rehman, a sitting MLA who recently switched from AAP to Congress.Congress is also emerging as the main contender against AAP in Muslim-heavy seats such as Matia Mahal (60% Muslim voters), Ballimaran (50%), Okhla (52%), and Chandni Chowk (30%).Clearly, many of these seats will be under close watch of all the stakeholders tomorrow when the votes are counted. We will have to wait for the actual results to find out if Congress has indeed damaged the prospects of AAP in these elections.","Pollsters give BJP a majority in the February 5 elections. If these predictions hold true on February 8 when the votes are counted, it would mark BJP's return to power in the national capital after 27 long years. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been in power for 10 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118014832,imgsize-1981646,width-400,resizemode-4/118014832.jpg"
AAP rejects Delhi exit polls claiming 'historical underestimation' - What pollsters said in last 3 elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-rejects-delhi-exit-polls-claiming-historical-underestimation-what-pollsters-said-in-last-3-elections/articleshow/117987056.cms,"Here's how correct the exit polls have been in the past.

Note

2013

2015

2020

NEW DELHI: Two more exit polls for Delhi assembly elections, Axis My India and Today's Chanakya, on Thursday predicted clean sweep for the Bharatiya Janata Party and placed Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at a distant second. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta said the exit polls have consistently underestimated the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, and in reality, the party often outperforms these projections.""Look at any exit poll from 2013, 2015, or 2020 – the AAP was always predicted to win fewer seats. But we ended up securing many more in the actual results,"" Gupta said.Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also dismissed the projections, calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies"".: Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters as they come out after casting their votes. They might not hold true on the day of results. The Election Commission will announce Delhi assembly results on February 8.In 2013, an average of four exit polls placed BJP in a strong position, predicting 35 seats, just one shy of a majority. They forecast AAP and Congress each securing 17 seats. However, the actual results saw the BJP winning 32 seats, AAP securing 28, and Congress just 8. The exit polls significantly underestimated AAP’s rise, with the party building on the India Against Corruption movement. With support from Congress, AAP formed government that lasted only 48 days, before Kejriwal resigned over the failure to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill and Delhi was placed under President’s Rule.Two exit polls — Headlines Today-ORG and ABP-Neilsen—overestimated BJP's strength, predicting 41 and 37 seats, respectively. All four polls also overestimated Congress's performance, predicting it would win in double digits. The most accurate exit poll was Today's Chanakya, which predicted AAP would win 31 seats, BJP 29, and Congress 10. On average, the polls were off by 11 seats for AAP, while giving three additional seats to the BJP and nine extra to Congress.In 2015, six exit polls predicted an outright AAP victory, but none could foresee the extent of its triumph. The average of these polls estimated AAP would win 45 seats, BJP 24, and Congress just one. In reality, AAP won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three. No exit poll predicted that AAP would exceed 60 seats, and only one, Axis My India, predicted the party would win over 50 seats, estimating 53. The lowest estimate came from India TV-CVoter, which projected 39 seats for AAP.For the BJP, exit polls suggested a much stronger performance, but not enough to challenge AAP. All but one poll predicted BJP would secure more than 20 seats, with Axis My India’s estimate of 17 seats being the lowest. Two agencies, Today's Chanakya and Axis My India, correctly predicted that Congress would fail to win any seats. However, other polls were more optimistic about Congress, with India Today-Cicero projecting it would win four seats, its highest estimate. The average of the six exit polls was off by 22 seats for AAP and predicted BJP would win 21 more seats than it actually did.By 2020, with 10 exit polls conducted, predictions for a strong AAP victory were once again widespread, with an average forecast of 52 seats for AAP, 17 for BJP, and just 1 for Congress.However, AAP performed even better, securing 62 seats, while BJP managed only 8. The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll was the first to report, predicting 47 seats for AAP and 23 for BJP. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted between 59 and 68 seats for AAP, and 2 to 11 seats for BJP.Sudarshan News predicted 24-28 seats for BJP, the highest projection for the party by any agency. However, AAP was expected to win only 41-45 seats according to Sudarshan News. The ABP News-C voter exit poll projected between 49 and 63 seats for AAP, and 5 to 19 seats for BJP, while the Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat exit poll predicted between 48 and 61 seats for AAP, and 9 to 21 for BJP.India TV projected 44 seats for AAP and 26 for BJP. In the 2015 elections, AAP secured a historic mandate, winning 67 out of 70 seats, with BJP taking just 3 and Congress failing to open its account.Despite some improvement in exit poll accuracy in 2020, the predictions still undershot AAP’s electoral performance, which solidified the party’s dominance in Delhi politics.","Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance. Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117987054,imgsize-1113799,width-400,resizemode-4/117987054.jpg"

The Coast Guard, in turn, is taking part with 10 ships and aircraft.The warships and aircraft are put through complex maritime operational scenarios to validate and refine the “concept of operations, including forward deployed sustenance and interoperability” in the IOR, which is witnessing growing maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan after the land borders.With the world’s largest navy with over 360 warships and submarines, China deploys seven to eight naval vessels and spy ships in the IOR at any given time. It is working to increase its “underwater domain awareness” in the region by mapping oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Concurrently, China is helping Pakistan build a bigger naval force, having already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates to Islamabad, with eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines and other assets in the pipeline.“These eight new submarines will add significant combat potential to the Pakistan Navy. We are fully aware of their capabilities. That is why we are tweaking our plans and concepts to negate any infringement of our interests. We are fully ready to take on any challenge,” Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi had said earlier.","India is conducting a massive naval combat exercise, with 65 warships, nine submarines and over 80 aircraft and helicopters.

According to NCB, its Mumbai unit made an initial recovery of 200 gm cocaine from a courier agency, which was in a parcel destined for Australia. The leads thrown up were developed through technical and human intelligence, and NCB Mumbai zonal unit was able to backtrack the supply to the bulk quantity, which was concealed at Navi Mumbai.NCB said the probe revealed that the syndicate behind the contraband is being operated by a group of people based abroad, with some of the seized quantities sourced from US and sent to multiple receivers in India and abroad through courier/small cargo services & human carriers. The persons involved in this case are anonymous to each other, using pseudo-names for day-to-day conversations on drug dealing, NCB added.","Narcotics Control Bureau seized grade-A cocaine worth over Rs 100 crore.

New Delhi: RG Kar Hospital rape-murder victim's father Friday moved SC for continuation of CBI probe into the crime, in which accused Sanjay Roy was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, to unravel possible roles of other accused who allegedly aided and abetted commission of the offence.Senior advocate Karuna Nundy mentioned the father's application for urgent hearing before a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar for ordering CBI to continue further investigation monitored by Calcutta HC even after conviction of the sole accused.The bench, which is seized of the case that SC had taken up suo motu, agreed to list the plea for hearing soon.The father had filed a writ petition before Calcutta HC for this, but it asked him to seek a clarification from SC on whether HC could proceed with hearing on the writ petition despite SC being seized of the matter.He relied on the chargesheet filed by CBI in the case on Oct 17 last year in which it stated ""acts/omissions on part of Abhijit Mondal, then SHO Tala police station, and Sandip Ghosh, then principal of R G Kar MC&H, with regard to attempt to hush up the matter, destruction of evidence have surfaced and both of them have been arrested and presently, are in judicial custody"".

It set aside the orders of the trial court and HC convicting him on the basis of his confession made to his family members and relatives of committing the crime.""No doubt there is a strong suspicion and the needle of suspicion qua the death points towards him, but as is the settled jurisprudence of this country, suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot take the place of hard evidence. The evidence on the basis of which the prosecution seeks conviction of the accused i.e. extra-judicial confession made before the above witnesses lack credibility, and hence, cannot be relied upon. Besides, the evidence suffers from material contradiction. Therefore, it would be wholly unsafe to sustain the conviction of the appellant based on such weak circumstantial evidence, which on the top of it lacks credibility,"" the bench said.",The accused was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in the case pertaining to Maharashtra's Thane in 2004.

BENGALURU: Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot has rejected the ordinance sent in by Congress govt to curb harassment of borrowers by microfinance institutions, citing concerns over severity of punishment and potential impact on the microfinance sector.Karnataka Micro Finance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance, 2025, sought to impose strict penalties, including a 10-year jail and Rs 5 lakh fine for violations.The governor, however, deemed these provisions ""excessive"" and suggested that police could enforce existing laws to address the issue.While law minister HK Patil said they would ""re-request"" the governor to approve the ordinance as it has been drafted keeping the interest of borrowers in mind, a senior law officer hinted at reworking the ordinance, accommodating changes suggested by the governor.With the ordinance back on drawing board, state govt faces the challenge of balancing borrower protection and viability of microfinance industry. Law department officials said this should happen within the next week and before the budget session starting in early March.According to the CMO, Gehlot raised concerns that the ordinance could negatively impact microfinance, which plays a crucial role in providing credit to poor. Karnataka govt had drafted the ordinance in response to a spate of suicides linked to coercive-recovery tactics by microfinance firms.","Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot has rejected the ordinance sent in by Congress govt to curb harassment of borrowers by microfinance institutions.

DEHRADUN: Army Public School in Birpur area of Dehradun has rescinded a notice sent on Feb 1 barring students with less than 60% in pre-board exams from attending the school farewell. Officials said that after a complaint was made in the matter, the state child rights commission stepped in to intervene.The notice, issued by the principal, was widely shared on social media.""When it was brought to our attention, we summoned the principal and demanded an explanation regarding the bizarre notice. They have now rescinded it, allowing all students to attend,"" said the commission's secretary, S K Barnwal. The commission also issued a warning to the school.Sources said the school administration had verbally informed the students about a similar decision last year but this year, a formal notice was issued, allegedly in consultation with the parents.Officials from the commission said that while verbal ultimatums might push students to perform better, a written notice of this nature is demoralising. ""Student scoring low in pre-boards is not indicative of their overall academic performance. They can improve in board exams. Keeping them away from a once-a-term social event is both unfair and upsetting,"" Barnwal added. The school could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts by TOI.Meanwhile, commenting on the issue, Arif Khan, president, National Association for Parents and Students rights, said, ""Such a notice, days before a student's board exams is very demotivating. It is bound to have an effect on their mental health. All students should have the experience of a farewell irrespective of their academic performances.

NEW DELHI: Even as EC drafts a response to questions raised by Rahul Gandhi on Maharashtra voter list, what seems to have caught its attention are the fluctuating numbers claimed by him thrice: 1 crore on Jan 15, 70 lakh on the floor of Lok Sabha on Feb 3 and 39 lakh at Friday's presser.EC sources said none of the three was correct, even though the poll panel had, in a letter to Congress on Dec 24, 2024, shared the exact figure of 48.8 lakh additions made to the state rolls between LS and assembly polls, reports Bharti Jain.In a formal response on X to INDIA bloc allegations, ECI, headed by Rajiv Kumar, said Friday it ""would respond in writing with full factual and procedural matrix uniformly adopted across"" India.EC also noted that political parties were ""priority stakeholders"" and their views, suggestions and questions were ""deeply valued"".In its Dec 2024 letter refuting Congress's allegations on Maharashtra rolls, the commission had explained that 26.4 lakh of the 48.8 lakh additions made between LS and assembly polls last year were new voters in the age group of 18-29 years. With over 8 lakh deletions, the net addition to the state's rolls was around 40.8 lakh, EC had said.On Rahul's demand that EC share the exact list of voters who exercised their franchise in Maharashtra, commission sources said Section 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1951, did not allow for providing names and addresses of voters as it would violate secrecy of vote and put voters at risk of post-election intimidation.Stating that the poll panel has already shared with Congress names, addresses and polling booths of all voters in Maharashtra Lok Sabha and assembly polls and the exact number of voters, booth-wise, in Form 20 as well as in Form 17C (available with each candidate), it underlined that this could not be the case with Form 17A as it has the signature/thumb impression of the elector and also details and number of the identification document produced by her for voting.

"Modern battlefields, ancient strategies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modern-battlefields-ancient-strategies/articleshow/118025121.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Life is a war; some days, it is merely a battle. Armouring our hearts, we navigate professions, relationships, friends, and foes, and march forward, sometimes with steady steps, sometimes staggering. Some battles are fought within, silent and unseen, while others are waged against the world. We fight to claim what is rightfully ours, to protect what we have painstakingly earned, against injustice, betrayal, and humiliation.

Since we must fight anyway, let us learn to fight well—and fight right. I have learned invaluable lessons about warfare from three different encounters. The most recent comes from a young girl who has made the nation proud—Vaishali Rameshbabu, the chess prodigy who constantly battles to step out of the shadow of her brother Praggnanandhaa.

Recently the Tata Steel Chess Tournament match witnessed an awkward moment— when Vaishali extended her hand for a customary pre-match handshake to Uzbek Grandmaster Nodirbek Yakubboev, but was ignored. Some say this was a psychological tactic, an attempt to unnerve her. Yet, Vaishali remained unshaken. She did not react or look up. Instead, she descended deep within herself, seeing only the 64 squares before her. And then, in a poetic stroke of justice, she defeated her opponent with ease. When you fight, expect humiliation. Swallow it. There is only one way to respond—by winning.

A karate master once shared a story about a ten-year-old boy born without a right arm. The master admitted him to his dojo, moved by the boy’s passion for the sport. When the school faced a rival in a karate tournament, the boy volunteered to compete, even though he was only a reserve. The opposing team had an undefeated star—a warrior who finished each match within seconds. As his teammates fell one by one, the boy stepped forward. The master hesitated but admiring the boy’s courage, allowed him to fight.

As soon as the bout began, the one-armed boy took down the champion and within minutes, he emerged victorious. Later, the master asked the boy how he achieved the impossible. The boy smiled and said, “I observed his pattern—he always seizes the opponent’s right hand before attacking. But he was lost since I had no right hand. Those few seconds of confusion were all I needed to strike.” What we perceive as our weakness can be our greatest strength, and vice versa.

A close associate once underwent a rigorous selection process for a leadership role. She was meticulous and did quite well in the grilling rounds. Observers felt she was the strongest candidate but in the end, she did not make it. Only later did she realise that the decision had been made before the interviews began. She opted to leave the organisation, but had learnt something during her struggle.

The key is to assess the battlefield before preparing for war . You may be a great warrior but if the terrain is set for someone else’s victory, you may not accomplish success.

Valluvar , with his penetrating insights into human psychology, their strengths and weaknesses, gave useful tips for any battle one has to combat.

“Vinaivaliyum Thanvaliyum Maatraan Valiyum

Thunaivaliyum Thookki Cheyal.”

“Assess the force the strife demands, assess your strengths, then that of foes and the allies of both; If favourable, then jump to fight”

The art of battle is not just about fighting. It is about knowing when and how to fight. Even if there is a loss, we return and begin again. Honour and valour are awarded to those who move forward and flourish in their journey.

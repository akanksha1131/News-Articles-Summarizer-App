NEW DELHI: The Indian military reported on Sunday that it inflicted significant damage on Pakistan's military forces during a three-day confrontation, including downing fighter jets with advanced technology and striking military installations near Islamabad.Director general of military operations Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai stated that 35-40 Pakistani military personnel were killed in the combat operations.""Pakistan will have to pay a very heavy price if it resorts to any more misadventure,"" said Lt Gen Ghai, adding that India had achieved its desired objectives.The damage inflicted included the destruction of Pakistani fighter jets equipped with latest technologies and strikes on key military facilities near Pakistan's capital. India executed a significant military operation within Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to civilian casualties. The operation accomplished numerous strategic objectives.India successfully destroyed nine crucial terror facilities across Pakistan and PoK, targeting installations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. These were identified as essential training and operational centres.India demonstrated a significant shift in its military strategy by showing readiness to conduct strikes deep within Pakistan's territory, including sensitive areas like Punjab province and Bahawalpur, moving beyond the traditional engagement limited to PoK.India's strikes reached hundreds of kilometers inside Pakistan, including areas like Bahawalpur that even the United States had not targeted with drone operations. The operations extended to Punjab province, which is considered a strategic military stronghold of Pakistan.Through these actions, India has established that it can reach any location within Pakistan, making it clear that neither the Line of Control nor Pakistan's internal territories are exempt from potential strikes.The new approach targets both terrorists and their supporters, marking a departure from previous policies that treated them separately. The operation established a clear stance against terrorism, implementing a doctrine of calibrated deterrence. It eliminated the traditional separation between terrorist organisations and their supporters.It also undermined the long-standing assumption that certain influential rogue elements within the Pakistani state could orchestrate terrorist activities with impunity.Indian forces conducted successful strikes using Rafale jets equipped with SCALP missiles and HAMMER bombs, effectively bypassing or jamming Pakistan's air defence systems during a precise 23-minute operation.The rapid operation revealed vulnerabilities in Pakistan's air defence infrastructure, as Indian forces were able to penetrate their systems without any reported losses.The mission's success demonstrated India's technological and strategic capabilities in executing precise military operations.India has demonstrated significant advances in modern air defence capabilities through its integrated defense systems and successful penetration of Chinese-made systems used by Pakistan.The Akashteer Air Defence System emerged as a particularly successful component, having neutralized hundreds of Pakistani drones and missiles. Its proven performance positioned it as a potential export option in the global defense market.The strikes affected 11 Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skaru, Bholari and Jacobabad, significantly impacting their air force infrastructure. This led to destruction of 20% infrastructure of Pakistan’s airforce. India bombed Pakistan’s Bholari Air Base killing over 50 people including Pakistan’s squadron leader Usman Yousuf, 4 airmen among others as well as destroying Pakistan’s fighter jets.The Army, Navy, and Air Force came together to execute coordinated strikes, prooving India’s growing joint warfare capability.The operation showcased India's tri-service coordination and precision targeting capabilities, avoiding civilian casualties while achieving military objectives.",The Indian military reported on Sunday that it inflicted significant damage on Pakistan's military forces during a three-day confrontation.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir and other border areas remained largely peaceful on the intervening night of May 11 and 12, approximately two days after ceasefire talks.Meanwhile, Indian forces on Sunday released satellite pictures of bases (before and after) in Pakistan and Pok that suffered heavy losses after India's ' Operation Sindoor .' Indian Air Force said that it successfully executed its assigned tasks with precision and in line with national objectives during the operation.""This multi-dimensional operation successfully neutralised terrorist threats, deterred Pakistani aggression, and reinforced India’s zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism, all while maintaining strategic restraint and international support,"" the Indian forces added.On May 7, the forces carried out ""coordinated precision missile strikes on nine terrorist facilities; four in Pakistan (including Bahawalpur and Muridke) and five in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (such as Muzaffarabad and Kotli). These facilities were key command centres for Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for attacks like Pulwama (2019) and Mumbai (2008).""""In response to Pakistan’s retaliatory drone and missile attacks on May 7, 8 and 9th 2025, targeting multiple Indian cities and military installations, India launched kamikaze drones to destroy Pakistani air defences across the country, including neutralising air defence system of Lahore,"" the statement from Indian forces added.On the intervening night of May 9 and May 10, India’s counter-military actions damaged major air force camps of Pakistan. ""Within 3 hours 11 bases were attacked, including Nur Khan, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skaru, Bholari and Jacobabad,"" it added.The scale of destruction can be clearly seen in the before and after photos of Shahbaz airbase at Jacobabad.","Satellite images reveal Operation Sindoor’s impact on Pakistan air bases, terror camps.

'If Pakistan does anything more, our response will be far stronger'

NEW DELHI: India will hit terrorists in Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told US secretary of state Marco Rubio in a phone call on May 1 after the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22, which killed 26 people.""We will hit the terrorists in Pakistan, and there should be no doubt about it,"" Jaishankar told Rubio, according to ANI citing sources.

On the same night, Pakistan attacked 26 sites and India responded very strongly. Strikes were launched on their bases,"" news agency ANI quoted sources as saying.According to the report, Vance, who was in India with his Indian-origin wife Usha and their children on the day (April 22) of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which led to the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours, called PM Modi on Friday (local time) with the message that the US officials had assessed there was a ""high probability of a dramatic escalation of violence that could tip into full-scale war.""PM Modi listened but ""did not commit to any of the ideas"" proposed by the US Vice President to de-escalate, the report added.Vance's intervention came just days after he said in an interview that the India-Pakistan conflict is ""fundamentally not our business.""India-Pakistan ties hit when terrorist opened fire at a famed meadow near Pahalgam town, dubbed ""mini Switzerland,"" and started firing at tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge denied by Islamabad. After this, India retaliated back on May 7 with ""Operation Sindoor.""India conducted strikes on nine terrorist locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). In response, Pakistan initiated unprovoked aggression using artillery weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles.During the night spanning May 7-8, Pakistan launched offensive operations targeting multiple military installations across Northern and Western India, including Awantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Adampur, Bhatinda, Chandigarh, Nal, Phalodi, Uttarlai, and Bhuj, utilising drones and missiles.The Integrated Counter UAS Grid and Air Defence systems successfully intercepted these attacks.Both the countries reached to an agreement for ceasefire on May 10 but after few hours, India accused Pakistan of violating the terms of the understanding on Saturday night and asked it to take ""appropriate steps"" to address these violations and deal with the situation with ""seriousness and responsibility"".But after few hours, the situation cooled down even though residents in several border areas continue to live in a state of fear following days of shelling and drone incidents.During discussions on May 10 between Rubio and Jaishankar regarding India-Pakistan tensions, Rubio stressed the importance of immediate tension reduction.He also confirmed US backing for direct talks between India and Pakistan whilst supporting enhanced communication channels."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar told US secretary of state Marco Rubio in a phone call on May 1 after the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22.

"Doctor practices while suspended, Punjab Medical Council complains to cops but revokes suspension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctor-practices-while-suspended-punjab-medical-council-complains-to-cops-but-revokes-suspension/articleshow/121092921.cms,"Representative image

The Punjab Medical Council (PMC) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension. This, despite having urged the police to act against the doctor on the grounds that doing so was illegal. Yet, the National Medical Commission refuses to take up the patient's complaint against this decision of the PMC.The PMC declined to reveal if the suspended surgeon fulfilled the conditions its ethics committee had recommended for him to be allowed to resume practice - a root cause analysis of the death of two patients who he operated on, and a certificate showing that he had got himself trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy .TOI asked PMC why its Dec 2024 order restoring the licence of Dr Praveen Devgan cited the high court order of Nov 20, 2024 when the court had not ordered restoration of licence. In response, it produced yet another council order dated April 25, 2025, which claimed that the decision to restore the licence was taken in the general body meeting on Sept 25, 2024 after receiving an application from Dr Devgan at the end of the six-month suspension period. PMC was mum on Dr Devgan continuing to practice during the period of suspension.""The case filed by Dr Devgan in July 2024 against his suspension was still pending on Sept 25. How did PMC take a decision to restore his licence before the court had decided the case?"" asked the complainant, Gokul Aneja, who has alleged medical negligence in the death of his wife Sunita Aneja. She was diagnosed with multiple fibroids and underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy by Dr Parveen Devgan on Oct 1, 2018.Dr Devgan's petition in HC was ""disposed of as withdrawn"" on Nov 20 last year because he had moved an application seeking to withdraw the petition. The court had neither stayed his suspension nor examined its merits.In PMC's general body meeting held on July 21, 2023 ""all the council members unanimously decided that Dr Parveen Devgan failed to demonstrate due skill and care towards patients"". PMC's final order on Dec 21, 2023, suspended his registration for six months and debarred him from practice. The order cited the ethics committee' recommendations. These included that he be restrained from performing any laproscopic procedure in his own hospital or in any other hospital till he submitted a root cause analysis of the deaths, done by a higher institute like PGI Chandigarh doing and imparting training in laparoscopic hysterectomy, and that he get trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy from a recognised institute and submit the certificate to PMC. The committee stated that Dr Devgan should be initially restrained for a minimum of six months that could be extended further till he complied with the two conditions of root cause analysis and certificate of training.When Dr Devgan applied to Fortis Hospital, Noida for training in laparoscopic hysterectomy along with other procedures in laparoscopy, the hospital informed him that he could not be trained in laparoscopic gynae procedures ""as by NMC guidelines you do not possess required qualification of post-graduation in Obs & Gynae"". ""It is unethical and unlawful for a general surgeon to do gynaecological training or procedures as he/she does not have the required qualification to do so,"" stated the hospital letter in May 2024.On receiving information that Dr Devgan was practicing despite suspension of licence, civil surgeon of Amritsar inspected the hospital on April 5, 2024, and found that he was performing operations. She informed the PMC and the police in Amritsar. The PMC urged the commissioner of police in Amritsar to take action as practising while his licence was suspended was illegal, and against the Punjab Medical Registration Act and the National Commission Act.","Punjab Medical Council (PMC) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension.

In conversation with TOI ’s Manash Gohain , Union education minister

defended

’s late but landmark endorsement of a

caste census

, calling it a ‘historic correction’ rather than a political U-turn. Rejecting Congress’s claim of a moral victory, he branded Rahul Gandhi’s celebration as ‘the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination’

Why did the PM suddenly back a caste census after years of silence - was it a strategic move or a reaction to Congress gaining

OBC

traction?

Doesn't the timing of caste census show BJP is anxious about Bihar, especially after Nitish Kumar's successful state-level survey?

Was the caste census timed to deflect attention from Pahalgam terror attack & national security lapses?

Isn't this a political U-turn to counter Congress-led INDIA bloc's growing OBC appeal ahead of 2025 state polls?

This is not sudden.BJP has always had a philosophical commitment to social harmony, social justice and affirmative action. From Jan Sangh era to Atalji and Advaniji's leadership during Mandal Commission, to today's govt under Modiji - our stance has been consistent. When VP Singh's National Front govt implemented Mandal Commission in the 1990s, BJP supported it unequivocally, standing by the principle of social justice. The PM himself belongs to an OBC community. This isn't a political response to Congress, it's a continuation of a long-standing vision.Let me remind you, in 2024 itself, the home minister said caste enumeration would be considered at the right time. That time is now. We are not reacting to Congress; we are fulfilling a national commitment. Unlike Congress, which used reservations opportunistically, we have converted our ideology into sustained policy action.That survey was part of NDA when we were in it, and we consider it an achievement. But there's a fundamental difference - that was a survey, this will be a census. A census is a constitutionally empowered exercise. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress seem unable to grasp that distinction. Our decision is not driven by electoral anxiety but by institutional process.We are creating a national framework for social justice. If anything, this reinforces BJP's seriousness about structural reforms, rather than merely responding to regional pressures.That's a completely separate issue. The Indian Army has full operational freedom, and the PM has made that clear. Security matters are being handled with utmost seriousness. Linking this with the caste census is not just disrespectful - it reveals how hollow the opposition's arguments are. We are not using social justice as a distraction. For us, it is a conviction, not a convenience.That accusation is laughable. Those who suppressed Kaka Kalelkar Commission, shelved Mandal Commission - Congress under Nehru, Indira, and Rajiv - they now want to claim credit? Rahul Gandhi should reflect on the hypocrisy of patting himself on the back for something his own party obstructed for decades. His celebration is not a moral victory; it is, frankly, the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination. This isn't a U-turn. This is BJP institutionalising what others only politicised.As education minister from a backward community, do you believe today's education system reflects caste realities - or is updated data from a census essential?n To make informed and equitable policy today, we need credible data. Social equality is a fundamental right - and that includes access to education. The caste census will provide a much-needed empirical base to understand educational disparities. You cannot address inequality without first recognising its extent. This is not just about data; it's about dignity.",Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan says caste census is not a political U-turn.

LoC, N-threat can no longer be used to hit India with terror strikes, say sources

NEW DELHI: India successfully managed to achieve three main objectives - political, military and psychological - from the May 7 military strikes , according to government sources.""The military aim was, as the PM said, terrorists ko mitti mein mila denge. That was achieved in Bahawalpur, Muridke and Muzaffarabad. The political was to raise the cost of terrorism for Pakistan and to keep Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance till Pakistan stops promoting cross-border terrorism .And the psychological objective was 'ghar mein ghus ke marenge' and that no place is safe for you. All three were successfully achieved,"" the source said.Also read: India agreed to pause as 'main objectives had already been achieved' The sources said India's military strikes on terrorist camps marked a new normal in ties - that LoC or nuclear threat could no longer be used to carry out terrorist attacks in India. They stressed that India was determined from the day of the Pahalgam attack that it would hit Pakistan's terror factory, with the PM asking armed forces to respond to every 'goli' (bullet) with a 'gola' (cannonball).While admitting that US Vice President J D Vance spoke to PM Modi on May 9, government sources said even after the talks, Pakistan targeted 26 places in India at night, after which Indian armed forces hit back hard.Government sources also said the Indian DGMO had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart minutes after the May 7 strikes. He is learnt to have told him that India had hit terrorist camps and was ready to talk. The Pakistani DGMO that day showed no interest in engaging India on the military situation, but came around after India rained ""hell fire"" on May 10.According to Indian authorities, while violence has stopped, Operation Sindoor is still not over and the Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance till the time Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism. Modi is learnt to have conveyed India's resolve to bring the perpetrators to justice in a conversation with US President Donald Trump on April 22 itself, while he was in Saudi Arabia on the day of the Pahalgam attack, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart Marco Rubio on May 1 that India would hit at terror camps in Pakistan.At a briefing on Sunday, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti made it clear that the calibrated strikes on the Pakistan airbases and radar sites were undertaken after Pakistan upped the ante by relentlessly launching waves of drone attacks to target Indian airbases, military assets and civilian areas.Also read: 'Decided to strike where it would hurt': Air Marshal AK Bharti gives details of India's retaliatory strikes on Pakistan airbases Displaying ""before and after"" satellite and other images to show how some of the bases were hit multiple times, he said there was major damage to runways, aircraft hangers and base infrastructure at other Pakistan airbases like Sargodha, which houses F-16 jets, Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari, Sukkur and Rahim Yar Khan as well.""To start with, our fight was only with the terrorists and not with the Pak Army. But we were relentlessly attacked and left with no choice,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.A NOTAM (notice to airmen), incidentally, has been issued by Pakistan, saying that the only runway at the Rahim Yar Khan base would be ""not be available for flight operations"" for at least a week.""Even more than the actual damage, the messaging that we can hit the heartland of Pakistan was the key. The strikes were precise in order to not cause collateral damage to civilian infrastructure,"" another senior officer told TOI.In all, the IAF fighters targeted nine airbases - the others being Rafiqui and Murid - as well as radar sites at Pasrur, Chunian and Sialkot aviation bases, as was reported by TOI earlier.Air Marshal Bharti did not specify the precision strike weapons used in the operation. Sources, however, said IAF deployed the twin-engine Sukhoi-30MKI fighters armed with the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been extended from 290 to 450-km, among other jets and weapons, for the mission that did not involve crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary.Other weapons included Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.The Sukhois, with a combat radius of almost 1,500-km without mid-air refuelling, and the extended range BrahMos, which flies almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, together constitute a decidedly deadly weapons package.Around 40 Sukhoi fighters have also been modified to carry the BrahMos missiles. The IAF has been practising air-to-ground precision strikes against high-value targets from long stand-off distances in the Bay of Bengal for quite some time now.This time, the strike mission was across the frontier with Pakistan. ""The IAF has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism. Operations were conducted in a deliberate and discreet manner, aligned with national objectives,"" the IAF, posted on 'X'.","India's military strikes on terrorist camps marked a new normal in ties.

NEW DELHI: Deep precision airstrikes with BrahMos supersonic missiles and other standoff weapons on several crucial airbases in Pakistan early Saturday proved to be decisive in the escalating hostilities between the two nations, causing the US to step in and push for a truce.India agreed as it had achieved its three main objectives — political, military and psychological — according to govt sources.The major hit on the Nur Khan-Chaklala airbase at Rawalpindi, which caused some damage to the infrastructure there, was particularly significant since it is located close to HQ of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, which handles its nuclear arsenal, and is barely 10km from Islamabad.Also read: Response to Pahalgam terror attack marks new normal in India-Pakistan ties Pakistan’s nuclear warheads, estimated to be around 170 like India, would be spread around the country in secret locations.

JAMMU: An uneasy calm descended Sunday on the forward areas along the international border and LoC in J&K’s Jammu division after days of heavy shelling by Pakistan, including for a few hours after a pause was declared on military operations.Residents of towns and villages in Rajouri, Poonch, Jammu, Samba and Udhampur gingerly got back to work amid confirmation that there was no ceasefire violation and drone activity from across the LoC since midnight.“With Pakistan, you never know. They violated the LoC ceasefire in Feb 2021 and 2003, too.

Our brave forces acted as a shield and saved us,” he said.Additional SP Mohan Sharma of Poonch led a team to Jhullas, Mangna and Salotri villages to assess the situation and reassure the local population that they would be safeguarded.""The safety of our border residents is our top priority.

NEW DELHI: Amid Indo-Pak tensions, Isro chairman V Narayanan on Sunday said 10 satellites are continuously working round-the-clock for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of citizens of the country.Addressing the 5th convocation ceremony of Central Agricultural University (CAU) at Agartala, the Isro chief said, “If we want to ensure the safety of our country, we have to serve through our satellites.We have to monitor our 7,000 km seashore areas. Without satellite and drone technology, we can’t achieve many things.”As of now, Isro has launched a total of 127 Indian satellites, including those from private operators and academic institutions. Of these, 22 are in low earth orbit (LEO) and 29 are in geo-synchronous earth orbit, owned by the central govt. India has around a dozen spy or surveillance satellites. They include Cartosat and RISAT series, as well as EMISAT and MicroSat series, which are designed for specific surveillance tasks.Just days ago, Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) chairman Pawan Kumar Goenka had said at Global Space Exploration Conference 2025 that India would put in orbit a constellation of 52 satellites over the next five years to step up space-based surveillance capabilities.“We have fairly strong capabilities already. It is just that it needs constant enhancement,” Goenka said. He said the plan is intended at increasing surveillance capabilities of the defence sector. “So far, this was primarily done by Isro. We will bring in the private sector as we move forward,” he said. The new satellites will help Indian Army, Navy and Air Force track enemy movements, monitor borders and improve real-time coordination during military operations.Narayanan’s statement has come at a time when Isro is scheduled to launch another surveillance satellite, EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) radar imaging satellite, into a sun-synchronous orbit on May 18 that will boost India’s surveillance powers along its sensitive borders.Saying that advanced satellite technologies are required for the common man's development, Narayanan predicted that before India celebrates 100 years of its independence, the country would be a master in every field, the country would be an outstanding contributor to the world.Isro and its several satellites are operational for the development of northeastern states and the execution of many projects in the region, he added. He urged students that after taking degrees, their responsibility is to give something to society.","Isro chairman V Narayanan on Sunday said 10 satellites are working round-the- clock for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of citizens of the country.

As per sources, the attacks were carried out using advanced air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs), likely the BrahMos.Imagery released by Indian space analytics firm KawaSpace confirms a direct hit on a hangar at Pakistan Air Force’s Bholari Airbase.Debris and structural damage were visible, with the strike's proximity to the runway suggesting that the targeted hangar may have had a quick reaction alert (QRA) role.At Shahbaz Airbase in Jacobabad, another precision strike reportedly hit a hangar on the main apron. KawaSpace imagery also suggests possible secondary damage to the air traffic control (ATC) building at the site.Sargodha Airbase was also struck, though the extent of damage has not been officially disclosed. KawaSpace provided updated runway imagery but has withheld additional assessments pending verification.Imagery from a Chinese satellite firm, MizazVision, appears to confirm that Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase was targeted as well. The Indian Air Force strike reportedly focused on disabling ground support vehicles and critical infrastructure on site.These strikes follow escalating military tensions and are part of India's broader Operation Sindoor , which aims to neutralize cross-border terror infrastructure .Earlier in the evening, in a rare joint press briefing by all three defence services, Air Marshal AK Bharti emphasized that the Indian response was deliberately focused on high-value targets. “A decision was taken to strike where it would hurt,” he said, outlining how Indian forces carried out a swift, coordinated, and calibrated assault on key Pakistani military infrastructure.The targets included airbases at Chaklala, Rafiq, and Rahim Yar Khan, followed by strikes on Sargodha, Bhulari, and Jacobabad. These strikes, Bharti added, were meant to send a clear message: “Aggression will not be tolerated.”Bharti also confirmed that the Indian Air Force thwarted an attempted breach of Indian airspace by Pakistani fighter jets following India’s cross-border counterterror strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’.“Their planes were prevented from entering our borders. We have definitely downed a few planes and inflicted losses on their side,” Bharti said, assuring that all Indian pilots involved in the operation had returned safely.The briefing came as all three wings of India’s armed forces shed light on Operation Sindoor, the large-scale military response launched on May 7 following the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted coordinated precision strikes on at least four Pakistani airbases on May 10.

NEW DELHI: Air Marshal AK Bharti on Sunday briefed on Operation Sindoor and said that the armed forces successfully destroyed terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir achieving its objectives with precision.During a press briefing regarding Operation Sindoor, he said the results were evident to the world.Regarding the operation, Air Marshal Bharti said, ""Have we achieved our objectives of decimating the terrorist camps, and the answer is a thumping yes, and the results are for the whole world to see.""The Air Marshal further added that the operation was aimed at hitting designated targets with precision, ""not to count the body bags,"" referring to the matter of the number of estimated casualties.""Whatever methods and whatever means we have chosen, it had the desired effects on the enemy targets. How many casualties? How many injuries? Our aim was not to inflict casualties, but in case there have been, it is for them to count. Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags,"" the Marshal said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that armed forces killed more than 100 terrorists including high value targets.""Those strikes across those nine terror hubs left more than 100 terrorists killed, including high-value targets such as Yusuf Azhar, Abdul Malik Rauf and Mudasir Ahmed, who were involved in the hijack of IC814 and the Pulwama blast,"" the DGMO said.The Marshal said the Indian Armed Forces successfully executed Operation Sindoor, achieving all selected objectives, with all Indian pilots returning safely.""All I can say is that we have achieved our objectives that we selected and all our pilots are back home,"" he said.Air Marshal Bharti confirmed that the Indian Air Force had downed several Pakistani planes while preventing enemy aircraft from breaching Indian airspace.""Their planes were prevented from entering inside our border.

Definitely, there are losses on their side which we have inflicted,"" he said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that Pakistan's actions were ""no less than war"". He also said that the Pakistan Army may be involved in the infiltration across LoC.""The activities that have been going on for the last 3–4 days are no less than a war. Under normal circumstances, the air forces of each other's countries do not fly in the air and attack each other. Under normal circumstances, infiltration across the Line of Control is done by terrorists. We have information that the Pakistani army may also be involved in infiltration across the Line of Control, which is trying to harm our posts,"" the Lieutenant General said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Saturday said that Pakistan’s military contacted India earlier in the day, and both sides agreed to stop all military action on land, at sea, and in the air starting from 5 pm.He added that orders were given to enforce the ceasefire, and another meeting between the two countries will take place on May 12 at noon.Hours after the ceasefire was announced, Pakistan reportedly violated it again, with Indian air defence intercepting Pakistani drones during a blackout in Srinagar.India urged Pakistan to take proper action to stop the violations and handle the situation seriously and responsibly. Earlier, Pakistan was also warned that any future act of terrorism against India would be treated as an ""act of war.""The Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoK).The strike came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.After India’s action, tensions between India and Pakistan increased sharply. This led to more cross-border shelling from Pakistan, with India responding in kind.Several areas near the border were placed on high alert, and blackouts were reported during Pakistani attacks.","The Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoK) The strike came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 civilians.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121083185,imgsize-452422,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"If Pakistan does anything more, our response will be far stronger, PM Modi told US VP Vance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-pakistan-does-anything-more-our-response-will-be-far-stronger-pm-modi-told-us-vp/articleshow/121090504.cms,"PM Modi and JD Vance (File photo)

NEW DELHI: PM Modi is learnt to have told US vice-president J D Vance on Friday, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" when the latter called him up to convey what US intelligence had gathered about Pakistan's intent to massively escalate hostilities.If Vance had expected that his dire message about the offensive intent of a nuclear-armed country would get Modi to lower the ante, he was mistaken.So, when Pakistan indeed widened the theatre a few hours later, India struck back by carrying out precision strikes at multiple PAF airbases, laying bare its air defence.The successful execution of Modi's intent was what forced Pakistan to approach India for pausing hostilities. India agreed, but after laying down its 'if you don't act, we don't act; but if you act, we react strongly' bottomline.Sources also feel Pakistan's alleged threat, which dramatically moved Vance from terming the conflict as ""fundamentally none of our business"" just a day before to playing the concerned mediator, may have been part of its by now familiar playbook to tap into the West's fears of a nuclear conflagration.New Delhi, however, did not indulge Washington's activism. Sources said external affairs minister S Jaishankar made it clear to US secretary of state Marco Rubio that if Pakistan wanted to talk, it could directly approach the DGMO here.Faced with the strong and effective response of our armed forces, they (Pakistan) ran to their uncle to seek its intervention,” a senior source said on what could have led the US to junk its ‘it is for them to sort it out’ aloofness to seek to play the firefighter.As the pause in conflict took effect, there is satisfaction here that Pakistan’s plan to drum up support by painting doomsday scenarios of nukes flying did not work. It failed to rally the Muslim nations, with deputy foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Adel Al Jubeir, visiting New Delhi as a mark of solidarity. “They were upset that the mass killings happened in Pahalgam during PM Modi’s visit (to Saudi Arabia) and conveyed the message that they were ready to help if needed,” the source said.Sources pointed out Iran was also sympathetic towards India. Algeria, an Islamic country which, like Pakistan, is a non-permanent member of UNSC, was party to resolution which stressed the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of the reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. Malaysia, another Muslim-majority nation, was equally forthright in its condemnation, sources said.Pakistan’s success in getting references to The Resistance Front, the LeT proxy, which had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam massacre, dropped turned out to be a pyrrhic victory, the sources said. “We only had to draw the attention of other countries to this and they agreed with our stand because we had been flagging TRF since 2022,” a senior govt functionary said.","PM Modi is learnt to have told US vice-president J D Vance on Friday, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" The successful execution of Modi's intent was what forced Pakistan to approach India for pausing hostilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121090733,imgsize-785368,width-400,resizemode-4/article-16.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Vice Admiral AN Pramod on Sunday said that in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the Indian Navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern Arabian Sea in full combat readiness, adopting what he called a ""decisive and deterrent posture.""Speaking at a joint press briefing alongside Army and Air Force officials, he confirmed that the Indian Navy had remained forward deployed with the capability to strike high-value targets, including Pakistan’s financial capital, Karachi, under Operation Sindoor “In the aftermath of the cowardly attacks on innocent tourists at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistani-sponsored terrorists on 22nd April, the Indian Navy's Carrier battle group, surface forces, submarines and aviation assets were immediately deployed at sea with full combat readiness,” said Vice Admiral Pramod.“We tested and refined tactics and procedures at sea during multiple weapon firings in the Arabian Sea within 96 hours of the terrorist attack,” he added.Vice Admiral also mentioned that Pakistan’s naval and air units were forced into a largely defensive stance, retreating to harbours or staying close to the coastline, movements that Indian forces continuously monitored.“Our forces remained forward deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea in a decisive and deterrent posture with full readiness and capacity to strike select targets at sea and on land, including Karachi, at a time of our choosing,” he said.Vice Admiral Pramod highlighted the measured approach adopted by India. “Our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said. “As we speak, the Indian Navy remains deployed at sea in a credible deterrent posture to respond decisively to any inimical action by Pakistan.”Delivering a pointed warning, he stated, “This time if Pakistan dares to take any action, Pakistan knows what we are going to do.”The briefing came just a day after Pakistan approached India with a proposal for a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea an understanding it violated later the same evening.All three branches of India’s armed forces, Army, Navy, and Air Force, addressed the media to provide a detailed account of Operation Sindoor, the military response launched on May 7 in retaliation for the Pakistan-backed attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.Pakistan responded to India’s counterterror operation with a swarm of drones and missile incursions over the subsequent days. However, India’s air defence systems acted swiftly and effectively, neutralising the threats and preventing any casualties or damage.Ironically, even as these hostilities unfolded, Pakistan reached out to India on Saturday, proposing a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea. The request, made via a call from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, was positioned as a step toward de-escalation.Yet, within hours of this outreach, Pakistan breached the very peace agreement it had proposed, casting a shadow over the credibility of its peace overture.","Vice Admiral AN Pramod said that in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Indian Navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern Arabian Sea in full combat readiness. “Our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121083062,imgsize-982686,width-400,resizemode-4/untd-5.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh while the Rahim Yar Khan airbase housed within the international airport of the same name in Punjab province suffered massive damage in coordinated Indian missile strikes targeting the country’s air defence infrastructure, authorities confirmed Sunday after taking stock of the impact of India’s “retaliatory” action early on May 10.The missile fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on the portion of the runway, the district deputy commissioner said.Sources acknowledged that the attack in the dead of night had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. Although passenger flights to and from the airport have since resumed, the missile strike has severely limited the military operations from the airbase.Pakistani officials emphasise Rahim Yar Khan’s strategic role in southern air defences, close to India’s Rajasthan border. They contested India’s statement that a wave of drones launched from the airbase to attack border villages invited the strong missile retaliation.The PAF casualties at Base Bholari in Sindh’s Jamshoro district included Sq Ldr Usman Yousaf and four others in uniform. The base supports F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets, critical to Pakistan’s southern air operations. Pakistani authorities didn’t specify the material losses. Indian media reports, unverified by Pakistan, suggest damage to aircraft and infrastructure.Pakistani officials also confirmed simultaneous attacks on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab), Murid airbase in Chakwal and Chunian airbase in Punjab. They mentioned damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.India officially named eight PAF bases, including radar sites in Pasrur and Sialkot. Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos” targeting Indian sites didn’t cause significant damage, the Indian military said in its first official presser since a pause in military operations.","A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh.

JAISALMER: A bomb disposal squad of the Indian Army safely detonated a powerful Pakistani missile warhead found in Badoda village of Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district on Sunday, capping a pause in hostilities that had kept the border area on the edge for over three days.The warhead, containing live ammunition, was discovered in a farmer's field after India's air defence system intercepted and shot down a Pakistani missile Saturday night, causing its debris to land in Badoda.The operation to detonate the unexploded warhead was conducted after cordoning off a large area to ensure there was no damage. A deep pit was excavated before the disposal team safely destroyed the warhead.The explosion was so loud that vibrations were felt some distance away as clouds of smoke and dust filled the sky, locals said.Officials said that had the warhead exploded on landing, it would have potentially caused a large number of casualties and extensive damage to property. SP Sudhir Chaudhary and officials from Jaisalmer Civil Defence oversaw the detonation with members of the Army brass.Chaudhary had issued a public advisory not to handle any discovered ordnance and to immediately report to the nearest police station if villagers found munition or any explosive. The SP also barred civilians from sharing images of ammunition on social media platforms.Meanwhile, an old hand grenade and some rusty cartridges were found in Pohda village of Jaisalmer.Police station in-charge Bagdu Ram said these appeared to be remnants from previous military exercises.","Bomb disposal squad of the Indian Army safely detonated a powerful Pakistani missile warhead found in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district.

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh Sunday lauded armed forces for avenging the Pahalgam massacre , stressing Operation Sindoor success had conveyed a message to terrorists. “Reverberations of action could be felt in Rawalpindi.”Displaying great valour and might, Indian armed forces have given an effective response. We not only targeted military installations but the reverberations of the action could be felt also in Rawalpindi where the Pakistan army is headquartered,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said in what appeared to be a reference to IAF’s successful strikes deep inside Pakistan Punjab.He said that coming after the surgical strikes in Uri and the airstrike on Balakot post-Pulwama, the multiple strikes as part of Operation Sindoor represented the Modi govt's zero-tolerance stance towards terrorism.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that it is new India which will not flinch from carrying out effective attacks on terrorism on both sides of the border,” he added.Significantly, Singh's remarks, the first by a senior minister after India acceded to Pakistan's plea to pause hostilities, came in his virtual address at the inauguration of a production facility of BrahMos missiles which were part of the arsenal IAF effectively used against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.Singh said Operation Sindoor was not just a military operation but also symbolised the country's political, social and strategic willpower under the Modi government. “We have shown that no space across the border is going to be safe from our counter-terror operations,” he added.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh lauded armed forces for avenging the Pahalgam massacre. “Reverberations of action could be felt in Rawalpindi,” he said in what appeared to be a reference to IAF’s successful strikes deep inside Pakistan Punjab.

""The aim was to revalidate our crew, armament, equipment and platform readiness to deliver various ordnance on selected targets precisely,"" he added.The Vice admiral said the forward deployment of the Indian Navy compelled Pakistani naval and air units to be in a defensive posture, mostly inside harbours or very close to their coast. ""The Indian Navy maintained seamless maritime domain awareness throughout the duration and was entirely aware of the location and movement of Pakistani units,"" he said.""In effect, we had, and continue to have, good battlespace transparency, using our maritime domain awareness grid,"" he said.""Under India's calibrated approach, we considered all options, including the ability of the Indian Navy for offensive action from and at sea,"" the DGNO said.""As part of the escalation control mechanism, the application of force by the Navy was planned in a synchronised manner in concert with the Army and IAF , the highlight being teams from the three services working closely in an integrated manner,"" he added.""Along with kinetic actions by the Army and IAF , the overwhelming operational edge of the Navy at sea contributed towards Pakistan's urgent request for a ceasefire yesterday,"" Vice Admiral Pramod said.The Navy remains deployed at sea in a credible deterrent posture to respond decisively to any inimical action by Pakistan, or Pakistan-based terrorists, he added.India carried out precision strikes on terror infrastructure early on May 7 following which Pakistan attempted to attack Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10.The Pakistani actions were strongly responded to by the Indian side by inflicting heavy damages to a number of key Pakistani military installations, including air bases, air defence systems, command and control centres and radar sites.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Saturday evening announced that India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop all firings and military actions on land, air and sea, with immediate effect.","Indian Navy's carrier battle group, submarines and aviation assets were immediately deployed at sea with full combat readiness in the aftermath of Pahalgam terror attack.

NEW DELHI: Buoyed by his ""mediation"" of what he described as a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, President Donald Trump waded into the J&K issue as well, saying he would work with both sides to find a solution, an offer India dismissed offhand although not in an official statement. Official sources here stressed India's position on the Union Territory has not changed and, as it has repeatedly said in the recent past, the only thing left to be achieved is the return of POK that remains under Pakistan's illegal occupation.The govt also ruled out any talks with Pakistan, in line with its long-held policy that talks and terror can't go together, following US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement that both countries had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.A top source also called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists wanted in India. ""What is it that we can talk to Pakistan about in the current circumstances? Hand over these terrorists to us and then we'll talk,"" he said. ""As for J&K, our stance has not changed. We are not going to discuss it with Pakistan,"" he added.Even during his previous term, Trump had offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue but with the qualifier that both sides had to agree to it. Complimenting both countries for their decision to stop fighting, and in remarks that were seen as drawing an equivalence between India and Pakistan, Trump said on this occasion, “I will work with you both to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”Indian authorities also emphasised that it was only through the conversation between the DGMOs on Saturday that they reached an understanding with Pakistan to end the violence.While Trump said millions could have died, suggesting the US might have been spooked by Pakistan’s nuclear weapon threat, govt sources said Pakistan can no longer use the same to deter India from acting against terrorists.Another senior source speaking on condition of anonymity said India did not indulge in any “shuttle diplomacy” after the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. “It wasn’t like the Parliament attack after which one-fourth of the US Senate was in India and another one-fourth in Pakistan (to defuse tensions). We always maintained that we will hit Pakistan if it chooses to escalate,” he said.“The message through Operation Sindoor was that no place in Pakistan is safe for terrorists. Nobody is untouchable,” he added.","President Donald Trump waded into the J&K issue as well, saying he would work with both sides to find a solution.

(Inputs from Chandigarh, Amritsar, Bathinda, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Gandhinagar)

Border districts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat began a tentative return to normalcy Sunday following a pause in military action between India and Pakistan late Saturday.Blackouts, widespread across several districts Saturday night, were scaled back or lifted Sunday as residents cautiously resumed daily life. Though drone sightings and sporadic reports of explosions persisted in some pockets, streets, markets and places of worship buzzed with restrained optimism.Punjab, with a 553km border with Pakistan, endured heavy drone and missile attacks Thursday and Friday.Cities close to the border, such as Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Bathinda , which reported drone sightings, lifted blackouts Sunday but continued urging residents to shut off outdoor lights voluntarily. Hoshiarpur ordered a blackout from 9.30pm.In Amritsar and Pathankot, unconfirmed reports of flying objects and sounds of explosions persisted into early Sunday.UAVs were also spotted in nonborder districts such as Patiala, Bathinda, Faridkot and Jalandhar, where residents were advised against bursting firecrackers, flying drones, or spreading unverified messages. Border districts of Amritsar, Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran and Fazilka saw a mixed picture Sunday. Temple bells rang and streets buzzed with life after days of fear and drone attacks. While malls and restaurants stayed active during daylight hours, voluntary blackouts were observed after 8pm.Amritsar resident Gurkirat Singh said: “We celebrated too soon. One moment we’re praying, the next we’re hiding in the dark.” Unconfirmed reports of drones and explosions Saturday night stirred fear in Amritsar and Pathankot. “Seeing projectiles streak across the sky was terrifying,” said Poornima Malhotra, a teacher from Pathankot. Shopkeeper Pawan Kumar from Gurdaspur remained uneasy. “What if the May 12 talks between India and Pakistan fail? Could war resume?” he asked.According to BSF officers, resumption of ceremonial parades at Attari, Hussainiwala and Sadiqi check posts remains undecided, as does pilgrim corridor to Kartarpur.Punjab education minister Harjot Singh Bains said all educational institutions statewide would reopen Monday, though DCs in border areas retained discretion. Schools in Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Barnala, Fazilka and Sangrur will remain shut Monday “by way of abundant caution”, a government official said.In Haryana’s Ambala district, which was under blackout Friday and Saturday, restrictions were lifted Sunday. District magistrate Ajay Singh Tomer advised citizens to avoid using outdoor lights powered by generators or inverters but allowed normal power use inside homes.In Rajasthan, districts along the border saw a cautious reopening. Markets resumed in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sriganganagar, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Phalodi after four tense days. Night blackouts remained in place in most districts due to fresh drone sightings and fears of renewed hostilities. Jaisalmer collector Pratap Singh authorised daily activities to resume, while Bikaner and Sriganganagar enforced blackout hours until May 12.Phalodi and Jodhpur, which saw consecutive blackout nights, reported no alerts Sunday and showed early signs of recovery. “The past four days were filled with uncertainty but Sunday remained normal,” said Phalodi collector Harji Lal Atal. Barmer collector Tina Dabi confirmed drone activity Saturday night but said no damage had occurred.Gujarat’s Kutch district, too, showed signs of easing. Commercial establishments in Bhuj, Lakhpat, Naliya, Adipur and Khavda remained open Sunday with no new drone sightings. A large crowd gathered at Bhuj’s main square to hail armed forces for defending border towns. Though blackout directives were lifted Saturday evening, brief drone activity prompted renewed surveillance by local authorities.","Border districts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat began a tentative return to normalcy Sunday following a pause in military action between India and Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: A day after India and Pakistan announced a stoppage of military activity, posts on the face-off continue to swamp social media.Getting suddenly into 'pause' mode drew another groan of disappointment from the Right, especially in the manner it came about. Noted columnist Swapan Dasgupta, a member of BJP national executive with 1.1 million X followers, posted, ""This ceasefire/'understanding' hasn't gone down well in India for (at least) 2 reasons: 1) It was peremptorily announced by Trump who suddenly appeared out of nowhere & pronounced his verdict 2) It is clear that Pakistan still sees terror strikes against Bharat as a virtuous act, even if it is regarded as an act of war.""Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, now chancellor of JNU, also expressed displeasure on X underlining that Pakistan had been let off.He stated, ""At the international level the issue of Pak involvement in terror has been papered over and the burden has been put on both countries to exercise restraint and find a diplomatic solution."" Sibal further said, ""US claiming mediation has detracted from India's long held position against mediation. US is equating India and Pakistan. This has implications. Can US be trusted?""Shefali Vaidya, convenor of the Indic Academy with nearly 800,000 followers, tweeted Saturday.

JAMMU: Security forces launched Sunday a cordon and search operation on the outskirts of Jammu after a brief gunfire exchange between a soldier and terrorists in Army fatigue near Nagrota Military Station the previous night.Sources said the exchange coincided with Pakistan’s drone attack and artillery shelling along the border, including Nagrota, late Saturday.“Searches resumed in the morning to trace the suspects and also to find the empty cartridges,” an official said. “Nothing substantial has been found so far.”This confrontation adds to a series of security alerts and terrorist sightings across Jammu region in recent weeks. On April 25, police and central forces launched a search in Kathua district after a local woman reported seeing four suspicious men.There have been some high-stakes pursuits in Kathua, Udhampur, Poonch, and Doda, but suspects continued evading capture by frequently shifting locations.","The exchange coincided with Pakistan’s drone attack and artillery shelling along the border, including Nagrota.

SRINAGAR: J&K police’s State Investigation Agency (SIA) announced Sunday searches and detention of several suspects across 20 locations in all districts of south Kashmir for allegedly propagating “anti-India narrative” and engaging in “terrorist conspiracy”.SIA claimed to have busted a sleeper cell whose operatives were in direct contact with handlers in Pakistan, conveying sensitive and strategic information about security forces and vital installations.The crackdown came a day after Islamabad and New Delhi declared a pause in conflict.“Substantial incriminating materials have been seized,” the SIA said, adding the raids were carried out under UAPA Act.According to an SIA statement, preliminary investigations “clearly brought out that these entities are actively engaged in terrorist conspiracy , propagating and furthering narratives aimed not only at challenging sovereignty and territorial integrity of India but also at inciting disaffection, public disorder, and communal hatred”.Surveillance has stepped up on terror associates and over ground workers (OGWs) in Kashmir. “Technical intelligence indicated that a host of sleeper cells in Kashmir were in direct contact with their handlers in Pakistan and were involved in conveying sensitive information via messaging apps including, but not limited, to WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and so on,” SIA’s statement read.These terror associates were also involved in spreading online radical propaganda at the behest of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad commanders, the agency said. “SIA is steadfast in its commitment to safeguard national security and uphold public order. It will continue to take firm action against individuals or groups involved in any kind of secessionist and terrorist activities,” the statement added.","SIA claimed to have busted a sleeper cell whose operatives were in direct contact with handlers in Pakistan.

SRINAGAR: A pause in military action between India and Pakistan took hold Saturday evening along LoC in Kashmir’s Uri sub-division, following days of heavy Pakistani shelling, drone attacks, and cross-border firing. However, hundreds displaced from border villages remained in shelters as security forces cleared unexploded ordnance Sunday.J&K police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.Specialised teams are sweeping villages for unexploded shells, warning that remnants from attacks pose a serious threat.“These dangerous devices can remain active for extended periods and may detonate with minimal disturbance, posing extreme danger to untrained people,” police said in a public safety notice. “All citizens evacuated from frontline villages are advised to refrain from returning until official clearance is provided.”Operations are expected to take several days depending on weather and contamination levels. “Your safety remains our highest priority,” police added, stressing that unauthorised returns to restricted areas could lead to legal consequences.District authorities have set up temporary shelters with food, medical supplies, and essential aid. Around 15,000 people fled villages such as Salamabad, Razarwani, Gingal, Lagama, and Banday in Uri sub-division in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district. According to 2011 census, Uri’s population stands at 74,867.In Uri town, life began to stir Sunday morning. A few shops reopened and residents returned. By afternoon, authorities again instructed people to vacate. “I came early morning from Baramulla. I opened my restaurant and hoped the situation would stabilise. But in the afternoon, we were told to return,” said Abdul Rashid, a restaurant owner who spent the night back in Baramulla.Residents expressed cautious hope. “We are happy there is an agreement. We are hopeful we will return home soon,” said a Uri resident at a relief centre in Baramulla.Former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti visited shelter homes Sunday, meeting displaced residents. “We don’t know how our family was saved,” said a woman from Salamabad. “We didn’t sleep a minute Thursday night and moved to Baramulla after shells landed in our village.”Mehbooba assured families she would urge govt to provide alternative housing and compensation. “War, bullets, and shelling have stolen homes and shattered childhoods,” she said. “In tin-roofed shelters, Kashmir’s children wait — not for revenge, but for peace.”","J&K police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.

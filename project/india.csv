PM Modi Flags Off India’s First Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Between Howrah-Guwahati In Bengal

NEW DELHI: Indian Railways ’ first Vande Bharat sleeper train attracted widespread attention for its modern features and promise of faster overnight travel. However, Indian tourists were quick to prove a lack of civic sense, as a video showing litter on the newly inaugurated train emerged.The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday. A passenger-recorded video from Malda shows plastic packets and spoons scattered across one of the coaches.Sharing the video, X handle @Indianinfoguide wrote, “People litter on vande bharat Sleeper train within hours of its inaugural run. Just see the civic sense.”Several social media users criticised the commuters for their behaviour. One commented, “honestly, this was an expected behaviour from the citizens of India.”Another added, “India doesn’t need enemies. We sabotage ourselves just fine. From breaking rules to trashing infrastructure, from apathy to entitlement, we do more damage internally than any external force could. The real national security threat isn’t always at the border. It’s our collective indifference to the country we live in.”Some users were more casual, with one writing, “Expected !! What’s new here…Wait for orange gutka stamps.”According to the Ministry of Railways, the first commercial run of the Vande Bharat Sleeper between Kamakhya and Howrah saw all tickets sell out within hours of bookings opening.The train’s launch followed the flagging off of India’s first Vande Bharat Sleeper by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Malda town in West Bengal on January 17. The service aims to make long-distance overnight travel faster and more comfortable while improving connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.The semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train will operate six days a week, except Wednesdays from Kamakhya and Thursdays from Howrah. It will complete the Howrah–Kamakhya journey in about 14 hours, making it the fastest train on the route. Key stops include Malda Town, New Jalpaiguri, New Cooch Behar, and New Alipurduar.The service is expected to significantly benefit passengers travelling between West Bengal and Assam, particularly those undertaking overnight journeys.","The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday.

PM Modi Signals Generational Shift As Nitin Nabin Becomes New BJP President, Calls Him His Boss

It may seem to people that Narendra Modi is the third-term PM of the country, he became CM at only 50 years of age and has been head of a govt for 25 continuous years. But above all this in my life is the fact that I am a BJP worker. This is my biggest pride, PM Modi said.He chose the occasion to emphasise the role of BJP’s organisational strength and discipline behind its rise, contrasting this with decline of Congress from the all-time high of over 400 parliamentary seats and nearly 50% votes in 1984 — the largest mandate for any political party — to its current struggle to win even 100 seats.“Congress can never introspect over its decline because it will raise questions over the family which has captured it. They keep looking for excuses. They have lost courage to look for even correct reasons behind their fall,” he said. LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly blamed an alleged collusion of EC and BJP for “vote chori” behind Congress’s string of dismal poll shows.“This family rule is an enemy of democracy,” Modi said and recalled after BJP’s big win in 2002 Gujarat polls, when he was CM, he was at a meeting to review reasons for its loss in some seats.BJP started as a party with a difference and has become the preferred party of governance, he said, in a nod to its “unprecedented” strike rate in recent assembly and civic polls.Raising the issue of infiltration and demographic imbalance, which he had flagged at a recent rally in assembly poll-bound West Bengal, Modi said even rich and strong countries are deporting infiltrators. “The world does not question them for expelling infiltrators,” he said, adding that these nations would claim to be flag-bearers of democracy and act like “nawabs (lords)” of the world. No country accepts infiltrators, he said, without naming any nation. While US has launched an expansive crackdown on infiltrators, several wealthy countries are also tightening measures against them.Asserting that India, too, cannot allow illegals on its soil, he called them a big threat to national security. “We will have to expose parties that are shielding them for vote-bank politics,” he said.In the same breath, he also slammed “urban naxals”, saying they are acquiring international dimensions and conspiring to harm India. They must be defeated by the party’s organisational and ideological strength, he said. Maoism is in its last breath in the country, he said.Modi touched on a host of his govt’s welfare measures and said he is giving an account of his work to the new chief who will write his confidential report, drawing good cheers from the audience.","PM Narendra Modi visited Motihari, Siwan, Madhubani and Patna since April.

"First thing I did after reaching space was to locate countries of my father, mother; I missed meeting Grp Capt Shukla on ISS who came after I left: Sunita Williams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-thing-i-did-after-reaching-space-was-to-locate-countries-of-my-father-mother-i-missed-meeting-grp-capt-shukla-on-iss-who-came-after-i-left-sunita-williams/articleshow/126886277.cms,"From Zero Gravity to Space Food: Shubhanshu Shukla Talks ISS Journey With PM Modi | FULL VIDEO

NEW DELHI: “When I reached International Space Station for the first time, the first thing I did was to locate India (on Earth), from where my father belonged to, and Slovenia, from where my mother belonged,” said Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams in Delhi on Tuesday — the only female astronaut who has set the world record for most cumulative spacewalking time by a woman with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes. During her lifetime, Williams went to space three times as a Nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space.Williams’s father, Deepak Pandya, is from Jhulasan village in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, where he was born before migrating to the US. Her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, is of Slovenian-American descent. Nicknamed ‘Suni’ or ‘Soncka’ in Slovenia, Williams was born in the US state of Ohio and has an elder brother, Jay Thomas, and a sister, Dina Ann.“Though I spent nine months in space during my latest trip to the ISS, I missed meeting Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla who reached the station just after I left,” Williams said during an interactive session, 'Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground' at American Center here.During her last trip to space before hanging her astronaut suit, Williams went to ISS in 2024 for a scheduled 8-day space trip but had to spend 9 months on ISS as the Boeing Starliner that took her to ISS malfunctioned and had to return empty-handed.Later, SpaceX's Dragon brought Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore back to Earth on March 18, 2025, with the duo ending up spending 286 days in space. India’s Group Capt Shukla went to space as part of the Axiom mission on June 25, 2025.Williams faced several health issues after returning to Earth after remaining in zero gravity for a long time. However, the 60-year-old was seen in high spirits in Delhi on Tuesday, guiding and inspiring Indian students to join the space sector. To cheer her at the Delhi event was the mother of another Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia crash in 2003. Williams, wearing a trademark deep blue space overalls and sporting a pair of space-themed canvas shoes, stepped off the dais and reached out to Chawla’s mother, Sanyogita Chawla, 90, who was sitting in the front row, and gave her a warm hug.When asked about the renewed global interest in the Moon, Williams acknowledged the existence of a modern “space race”. “I think there is a space race going on. We want to get back to the moon sustainably and start the conversation about rules of engagement— how we actually work together with other countries. We want to do this in a productive, democratic way, much like Antarctica,” she said.Williams asserted that the horizon of space exploration is rapidly expanding beyond traditional boundaries, stating that the commercialisation of space is creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation. “Commercialisation of space is great. It means there are opportunities for people to work in so many different companies— not only rockets and spacecraft, but parts of space, experiments, satellites, and 3D printing of metals,” she said.“In my childhood, I never dreamt of becoming an astronaut. We used to watch Star Trek on black & white TV. After I did my schooling and graduated, my brother pushed me to join the military and, thereafter, I became a Navy officer,” she said. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career in the US Navy before donning the astronaut suit. While flying aircraft as a Navy commander, I then wished that I should go to the Moon. From then on, I pursued the career of an astronaut,” Williams recalled.“When I reached the ISS, I was craving for Indian food. I was delighted to see that somebody sent me an Indian dish (in the food cargo) though others were making faces. I was glad to also receive 3D printed models of my dogs on ISS.” In Nasa circles, Williams was called the ‘samosa astronaut’, as she liked carrying samosas to space.An athlete since childhood, Williams wanted to participate in a marathon. “So, my sister told me, ‘I will run on your behalf on the ground and you run in space. So that is how I decided to run a marathon in space,” she revealed. Williams ran the Boston Marathon in space in 2007 after qualifying by running the Houston Marathon in 2006, marking the first time a marathon was completed in orbit. She ran on a treadmill aboard the ISS, finishing in 4 hours and 24 minutes while her sister and others ran on Earth.Recalling her most difficult space job, Williams said she went for a spacewalk after the Starliner faced a technical issue and returned to Earth and the Dragon spacecraft was docking at ISS. “While I was replacing a defected reflector, I had ensured that the Dragon capsule was not damaged with my steel helmet. So, I did the job of replacing the reflector by bending my head on one side for over 1.5 hours. After I returned to my space cabin, I faced neck cramps the whole time. ”Williams, during her extended 9-month stay on ISS, conducted along with her crew over 150 scientific experiments and technological demonstrations, accumulating more than 900 hours of research across various fields like space gardening, microgravity biology, and water recovery systems.The Nasa astronaut said the perception about life on Earth changes when people go to space. “I am married and I argue with my husband like other couples do. But after reaching space (seeing the vast expanse of universe), I used to wonder why we argue (on minor issues) at all,” she said, adding, “The first thing I ate after returning to Earth was the bread my husband baked for me.”","Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams spoke in Delhi on Tuesday.

This is the third time in the last three months that ED has written to the state govt pointing out alleged corruption in municipal administration and made corruption charges against Nehru.The probe agency mentioned that in its earlier letter written to govt on Oct 27 last year, it had brought to its notice the alleged malpractices in the exams and selection process for officers and staff (2024-25, 2025-26) of MAWS dept of Tamil Nadu.Its note had provided purported “evidence of bribes of Rs 25 lakh to Rs 35 lakh being collected from each candidate” and shared details of 150 such candidates, which were seized from a close associate of KN Nehru.

The minister had earlier denied all the allegations and termed ED’s actions as being politically motivated.Sources said the agency pointed out in its letter that the bribes were utilised for luxurious lifestyle, creation of personal assets, political expenditure, etc. by its beneficiaries. The proceeds of crime were laundered through the hawala network, both within and outside the country, to keep the identity of ultimate beneficiaries a secret and leave no money trail.The agency claimed that it had seized the evidence during searches at several premises of relatives and associates of KN Nehru across Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore in April 2025 in connection with its investigation into a bank fraud case based on an FIR registered by CBI-ACB, Chennai.The predicate offence, i.e. the case registered by the CBI-ACB, eventually collapsed after the accused settled their loan which was outstanding with the bank.",ED has written a letter to the Tamil Nadu govt asking it to register an FIR against municipal administration and water supply (MAWS) minister KN Nehru.

Who is Nitin Nabin?

Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

He is 45 years old and is the youngest national president of the BJP, surpassing Nitin Gadkari’s record.

Nabin is a five-term MLA from Bankipur in Patna, one of the BJP’s strongest urban constituencies in Bihar.

The new BJP chief currently serves as Public Works Department (PWD) minister in the Bihar government.

His rise in the BJP is closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership style and organisational inputs from Amit Shah.

He comes from a strong political lineage and is the son of veteran BJP leader Nabin Kishore Sinha , who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics.

, who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics. Nabin began his political journey through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and later rose through the BJP’s youth wing.

He has held key organisational roles, including national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJYM Bihar president (2016–19).

Nabin played a crucial organisational role in BJP’s Chhattisgarh turnaround, accurately predicting the party’s 2023 assembly victory and later overseeing its strong 2024 Lok Sabha performance.

Belonging to the Kayastha community, a numerically small group in Bihar, his elevation underlines the BJP leadership’s preference for organisational ability over caste arithmetic.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitin Nabin on Tuesday assumed charge as the party's new national president, marking a key transition in the ruling party's organisational leadership.The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with several senior party leaders. BJP chief ministers, national office-bearers, state unit presidents and members of the party’s national executive were also present at the event held in the national capital.The ruling party on Monday declared Nabin as its sole candidate for the post after the nomination and scrutiny process concluded without any rival contenders. This cleared the path for his unopposed election as the party’s 12th national president.In a late-night statement, BJP National Returning Officer K. Laxman said that only Nabin’s name remained after the completion of nominations and the withdrawal window, confirming his election by consensus.After assuming the position, Nitin Nabin said the moment is ""a moment of resolve"" for him and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister.""Today, I am not just assuming a position. I am accepting the ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of this party, and on this occasion, I also pay my respects to all my senior colleagues...Today, 140 crore Indians are connecting themselves with the dream of a developed India and are working to take the country forward,"" Nitin Nabin said in his first address after taking charge as the BJP chief.“When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, calling himself a “party worker” of the BJP.Addressing the gathering after the inauguration of Nitin Nabin as the BJP's youngest-ever national president, PM Modi said: “When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss.”The Prime Minister also highlighted new party chief's age, saying, “…Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP. To put it in the language of today’s youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial.”Elaborating further, PM Modi said, “The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen. At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.Ahead of the formal assumption of office, the BJP headquarters in New Delhi wore a festive look on Tuesday morning. Nabin began the day by offering prayers at the Jhandewalan Temple and later visited the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.Reacting to his elevation, BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said the party’s decision reflected its intent to promote younger leadership while relying on experience.“The party has taken a resolve to give space to young leadership. He is young and also quite social. He has a lot of experience. Our party is the largest party in the world. Under his leadership, even better work will be done,” Mishra told reporters.Nabin has been serving as the party’s working national president prior to this elevation.","Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address, expressing disappointment over what he said was a lack of respect for the national anthem . He also claimed that his microphone was switched off during the proceedings.“I am disappointed. National Anthem was not given due respect,” the governor said. He added that “it is unfortunate that his speech was interrupted.”Inside the House, the situation led to a sharp exchange, with assembly Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established rules and customs of the assembly.Later, Raj Bhavan issued a press release explaining the reasons behind the governor’s walkout. “The governor’s mic was repeatedly switched off, and he was not allowed to speak,” the statement said. It also claimed that issues such as “atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women are sharply increasing,” but were “totally bypassed in the speech.”The release further alleged that the “National Anthem is yet again insulted, and the Fundamental Constitutional Duty is disregarded.”Meanwhile, AIADMK general secretary and leader of opposition in assembly Edappadi Palaniswamy raised slogans with party leaders at the entrance of assembly after they walked out from the House over law and order issues in Tamil Nadu.This was not the first such incident. A similar episode took place last year when governor Ravi walked out of the Assembly in what he described as “deep anguish,” alleging that the “constitution of Bharat” and the National Anthem were insulted.With Assembly elections drawing closer, the session is being viewed as politically crucial. Opposition parties, including the AIADMK and the BJP, are expected to level several allegations against the ruling party and the state government.Chief minister M K Stalin and his Cabinet colleagues are preparing to counter the attacks, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged assembly session.",Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address.

Politics not a position of authority, it is responsibility

PM Modi leads party in congratulating Nabin

Congress mocks BJP’s election process

Nabin’s rise in BJP

NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin , who formally took charge as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party today, has his task cut out for him. His immediate challenge are the assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The BJP has a lot at stake in this round of elections as it defends its government in Assam and Puducherry and goes all-out to wrest power from Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in West Bengal. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the BJP is trying hard to expand its base.2027 will be another busy year electorally for the BJP president as seven states, including Uttar Pradesh, will vote to elect new assemblies. The other six are: Gujarat, Goa, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Himachal and Manipur.Chhattisgarh, a state which played a key role in giving prominence to Nitin Nabin, will vote in 2028 along with eight other states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. Nitin Nabin was the party in charge in Chhattisgarh in the 2022 assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.And finally, 2029 will see the BJP under Nitin Nabin go all out for a record fourth consecutive victory in the general elections.The five-time Bihar MLA, who is widely recognised for his organisational acumen and administrative experience, will play a key role in anchoring the BJP's election efforts.More than the opposition parties, his toughest competition will come from his predecessors in the party who have led the party to great electoral successes since 2014.With coalitions becoming an integral part of today’s politics, Nitin Nabin will also have to play an important role in working with the party’s regional allies in different states.The appointment of 45-year-old Nitin marks a generational shift in the BJP’s leadership role and has been hailed by all the party leaders. However, for Nitin Nabin, this comes as a challenge as he faces the difficult task of managing the many senior leaders who have decades of experience and some of whom were hopeful of getting the coveted top BJP post.While on the one hand he would want to use their experience to the hilt, on the other hand he would have to ensure to keep them all in good humour for the smooth functioning of the party.For Nitin Nabin, the youth and Gen Z outreach will be both personal and political. Nabin has become the first millennial born post-Emergency president of the BJP.Thus, he must make fresh attempts to connect with Gen Z voters born after 1997, a voter base critical in upcoming assembly elections. This outreach will also test whether the BJP’s ""25-year vision"" resonates with young voters to be converted into election polls or not.Soon after assuming the party president post, he appealed to the youth to enter politics to fulfil PM Modi 's resolve of making India developed.""On August 15, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called upon the country's youth to enter public life. I want to ask the country's youth that keeping distance from politics is not the solution but making active contributions,"" he said.""At the same time, I would also like to point out to the youths that there is no shortcut in politics. Politics is not a 100-metre race but a marathon where one's stamina and not speed is tested. Come forward and let's work on this political pitch keeping our roots strong,"" he added.In his address after taking charge, Nabin said that this day is ""a moment of resolve"" for him, as he is not just assuming a post but also the ""ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of the party"".""We are associated with such a political party, where politics is not power, it is spiritual practice, not indulgence, but sacrifice. It is not luxury and comfort, it is austerity. Politics is not a position of authority, it is responsibility,"" Nabin said.He asked party leaders and workers to make an all-out effort to ensure the BJP's success in the upcoming assembly polls in five states, including West Bengal, to protect the ""Sanatan traditions and faith"" and the country from demographic changes.PM Modi led the party in congratulating Nitin Nabin and said, ""To put it in the language of today's youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial."" He elaborated that 45-year-old Nabin belongs to a generation that has witnessed major economic, social and technological transformations, saying, ""He belongs to the generation that received information from the radio in their childhood and is now an active user of AI. ""Highlighting the importance of the coming decades, PM Modi said, ""The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen."" He expressed confidence that Nitin Nabin would carry forward the party's legacy, adding, ""At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.""Stressing on Nabin’s important role ahead, PM Modi said: ""When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is the boss, and I am a party worker. Now Honourable Nitin Nabin ji is the president of all of us, and his responsibility is not just to manage the BJP, but also to ensure coordination among all NDA allies.""However, the Congress was quick to mock the BJP’s election process. The ruling party announced the president first and then stated that there would be an election, but there was none, the Congress said.The opposition party also took a dig at Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, saying he is unhappy as he did not get anything to ""manipulate"" in this process.""Gyanesh Kumar wants to resign in protest; he has no role, he can't even influence, he can't even manipulate anything,"" the Congress' media and publicity department head, Pawan Khera, said while targeting the CEC, whom the opposition party has been attacking over alleged irregularities in elections.Congress MP Manickam Tagore claimed that key decisions in the BJP are taken only by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah .""There is no democracy in the BJP, only HM Amit Shah and PM Modi take the decisions, and they have proved it again... What is the work of the returning officer when there is no election? We hold elections in Congress, and Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor were candidates, and voting took place. This is called democracy. PM Modi and Amit Shah want to take over the role of all the workers... BJP is an authoritative party and moving towards dictatorship,"" he said.Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal also criticised the BJP, with MP Manoj Jha saying, ""Don’t call it an election... an election is only called when there are two or more choices. Nevertheless, he has become the national president, and I extend my best wishes to him.""Born on May 23, 1980, in Jharkhand's Ranchi, Nabin entered electoral politics at a young age and was first elected to the Bihar legislative assembly in 2006 from the Patna West Assembly constituency. Since 2010, Nabin has been elected from the Bankipur assembly constituency in 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025, thereby becoming a five-time MLA. He has held key portfolios like road construction, urban development & housing and law in the Bihar government as a cabinet minister.Nabin’s soft demeanour, which may have played a key role in his elevation as BJP president, will be put to the ultimate test as he navigates the complexities of his new role.","Nitin Nabin formally took charge as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party today. His immediate challenge is the assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

However, they added that the the Indian Mission and all Posts continue to remain open and fully operational.Ties between New Delhi and Dhaka have remained strained since the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus assumed office following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with India continuing to flag concerns over the safety of minority communities., especially Hindus.On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was continuing to see “a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists”, stressing that such incidents must be addressed “swiftly and firmly”.Relations faced another setback following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising, was killed in December amid heightened political tensions, sparking unrest in several areas. Protests also erupted after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Meanwhile, from exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for the instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","India has reportedly asked dependents of Mission & Post officials in Bangladesh to return home as a precautionary step.

The elimination of bonds as an anonymous source of political funding by corporates corresponded with a nearly three-fold rise in donations from companies and organisations declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25. As per the report filed with EC, corporate donations to BJP rose to Rs 5,422 crore from Rs 1,885 crore in 2023-24.Congress, in its 2024-25 annual audit report filed earlier, had declared a total income of Rs 918 crore and expenditure of Rs 1,112 crore.The main opposition party's receipts via grants, donations and contributions saw a nearly 54% dip to Rs 522 crore from Rs 1,130 crore in 2023-24. This may be on account of the elimination of bonds, considering Congress had raised almost Rs 828 crore through this route in 2023-24.Individual donors contributed Rs 641 crore to BJP in the last fiscal, up from Rs 240 crore in 2023-24.Of the total Rs 6,769 crore income declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25 - up from Rs 4,340 crore declared in 2023-24 - Rs 6,125 crore came from voluntary contributions, Rs 634 crore as interest from banks, Rs 5.7 crore as fees and subscriptions and Rs 4.5 crore as 'other income'.On the expenditure side, BJP spent a total of Rs 3,775 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 3,335 crore was for election propaganda. This is almost double the Rs 1,754 crore it had spent under the same head in 2023-24. Congress election expenditure in 2024-25 stood at Rs 896 crore, up from Rs 620 crore in 2023-24.Electronic media publicity saw the highest spend by BJP in the last financial year, touching almost Rs 1,125 crore compared to Rs 435 crore in 2023-24.Hoardings cost the BJP nearly Rs 107 crore; air travel, Rs 583 crore; and financial assistance to candidates, Rs 313 crore. Another Rs 91 crore was spent on morchas and rallies, while meeting expenses amounted to nearly Rs 52 crore.Having started 2024-25 with a general fund opening balance of Rs 9,170 crore, BJP ended the year with a surplus of Rs 2,995 crore, which made for a closing balance of Rs 12,164 crore.","Voluntary contributions received by BJP in 2024-25 rose almost 54% to Rs 6,125 crore from Rs 3,967 crore in 2023-24.

The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil. India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819023,imgsize-1156523,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Monkey pox strain links Kerala cases to foreign travel: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monkey-pox-strain-links-kerala-cases-to-foreign-travel-study/articleshow/126869621.cms,"PUNE: A first-of-its-kind genetic study of a newer and more stubborn Mpox variant detected in Kerala has linked those cases to international travel and reported signs of continued human-to-human transmission. The study of Mpox Clade Ib, which has been driving outbreaks in parts of Africa and has since showed up in several countries outside the continent, showed that it is prone to spreading faster and wider than older variants of the virus, necessitating enhanced surveillance.The study, led by researchers from Pune's ICMR-National Institute of Virology and teams from Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories across India, focused on 10 lab-confirmed cases of Mpox Clade Ib in Kerala between Sept 2024 and March 2025.The findings, published in the journal Virology, indicate active viral evolution with implications for disease surveillance and public health preparedness. ""The study confirmed the Mpox virus is indeed mutating, as we found a distinctive mutational pattern that signals sustained human-to-human transmission,"" a researcher said.Scientists found the mutation pattern stronger in Clade Ib than in older forms of the virus, suggesting it continues to adapt while circulating.""The sequences also carried mutations in several genes that had earlier been identified as hotspots in Clade Ib strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo, pointing to evolutionary convergence across different regions,"" a scientist involved in the study said.A new mutation was detected in six of the 10 cases. The researchers studied patients' symptoms, viral load, immune response and the full genetic sequences of the virus. The findings showed that the virus arrived in India not through one carrier but as part of a wider regional spread linked to international travel.Epidemiological analysis showed nine of the 10 patients had travelled abroad prior to testing positive for the strain.

Sunita Willaims Is Free: Hugs, Tears At ISS As SpaceX Replacement Crew Meets Stranded Astronauts

NEW DELHI: Calling her visit to India a homecoming, Indian-origin Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams on Tuesday said India held personal importance for her as it was the country where her father was born.Speaking at an interactive session at the American Center in New Delhi, Williams said, ""One of the first things you do when you get to space is that we all want to look for our home, like our immediate home. I grew up in Massachusetts. My father's from India. My mother's from Slovenia. I'm obviously looking for these places to call home.""Williams also spoke about her extended stay aboard the International Space Station after an eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months due to technical issues with the Boeing spacecraft. Recalling life aboard the ISS, she said, “We are not the best singers, but we can make space cakes,” drawing laughter from the audience. “You would see almost 12 people on the ISS at one point in time,” she said.Reflecting on how space travel changed her outlook, Williams said, “It really makes you feel like we are just one,” adding that differences between people seem far smaller when seen from orbit.""Every person I know is there, every animal, every plant, everything we know is there. We're all in this one little space in our solar system, and I think it changes your perception about us having any differences.

This cannot be put into practice...If 5000 dogs are removed, where will you keep them? You need 50 shelters...But you do not have that. You need people to pick them up.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension over the Karnataka chief minister 's post resurfaced on Tuesday after DK Shivakumar ’s brother said Rahul Gandhi had assured the deputy chief minister that a decision would be taken at an appropriate time.Former MP DK Suresh described Shivakumar as a committed party functionary and said the Congress leadership, including Gandhi, had asked him to exercise restraint while assuring him that the matter would be resolved in due course.“The party has already asked him to be patient. Rahul Gandhi, during the meeting in Mysuru, also said that an appropriate decision would be taken at the right time,"" news agency PTI reported him as saying.He also said that Shivakumar’s approach was guided by the need to keep all 140 Congress legislators together and maintain stability in the government. Emphasising that political authority requires perseverance, he added, “In the interest of the party and legislators, and with the goal of keeping all 140 legislators together, he is patiently waiting for the party’s decision.”With an eye on the 2028 assembly elections, Suresh also stressed that unity within the Congress would be critical.“He is also the party president and should maintain discipline first, which he is following diligently,"" he said refering to Shivakumar.The leadership churn in Karnataka intensified after the Congress government completed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, 2025. The speculation centres on a reported power-sharing understanding between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar at the time of government formation in 2023. Shivakumar has previously said discussions on the issue were held with the Congress high command and that while a decision had been taken, its timing is yet to be finalised.Suresh indicated that the upcoming legislative session, scheduled from January 22 to 31, could be a reference point, after which the party leadership’s stand may become clearer.Meanwhile, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he would travel to New Delhi if called by the Congress high command to discuss the leadership issue. He reiterated that any such engagement would depend on a formal summons from the party leadership. ""I will go if I am called by the Congress high command,"" he said.Siddaramaiah also sought to shift focus to governance, noting that the joint session of the state legislature would be held from January 22 to 31, alongside a special session on MGNREGA.

NEW DELHI: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged the challenge from “urban Naxals” on Tuesday, Congress took a swipe at him, citing a reply from Centre in Parliament stating that home ministry does not use the term “urban Naxals” and asking the PM whether he believes that anybody opposed to him is deemed so.Reacting to the PM’s remarks during his address at BJP headquarters after Nitin Nabin was declared elected as the party’s national president, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, “The PM spoke today of the danger from what he called ‘urban Naxals’.” “On March 11 2020, the minister of state of home answered a question in Rajya Sabha saying home ministry does not use the phrase ‘urban Naxals’.

The earlier practice that allowed members to mark their attendance from lobbies as well is set to be discontinued in a move aimed at encouraging parliamentarians to be a part of the proceedings.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 86th All India Presiding Officers’ Conference in Lucknow, Birla emphasised the need for seriousness and discipline in Parliament, which has often seen days-long interruptions by opposition members protesting over different issues.Now, MPs will be able to register their presence only when the House is functioning and will be unable to do so when it is adjourned, even due to disruptions. The Budget session is beginning from Jan 28.Birla said that the decision is aimed at ensuring that MPs’ attendance accurately reflects their active participation in the proceedings rather than their mere presence within the Parliament complex.Designated consoles that allow MPs to register their presence are already installed at every seat inside the Lok Sabha chamber. The reform is part of a broader effort to modernise parliamentary procedures and improve the overall productivity of legislative sessions, he said.In his remarks at the event, Birla said Parliament has formed a committee to look into ways to bring uniformity in rules and traditions applicable in the legislative bodies across India as he highlighted the significance of healthy competition among state legislatures on various parameters.A responsive, inclusive and forward-looking legislature is central to sustaining the vitality of parliamentary democracy, which is a must to enhance public confidence in democratic institutions, he added.",Lok Sabha MPs will be able to punch in their attendance only from their designated seats inside the House from the upcoming Budget session.

NEW DELHI: In his maiden address after taking over as BJP national president, Nitin Nabin on Tuesday asked party workers to mount a fight to “protect” the centres and legacy of Sanatan faith, saying political parties opposed to ‘deepam’ tradition in Madurai or existence of Ram Setu should have no space in politics.Nabin, whose elevation at 45 years of age is being seen as a generational shift in BJP, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an inspiration and urged the youth to heed his call for joining active politics by saying “keeping a distance is no solution”. Youth should treat politics as a marathon and not a 100-metre sprint and prioritise stamina over speed, he said, adding that BJP’s “watch tower” is vigilant enough to identify their talent.Nabin’s unopposed election as the 12th BJP president was announced at a function at the party headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of PM Modi and several former party chiefs, including JP Nadda, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari.Shah congratulated Nabin, expressing confidence that his tenure as BJP president under Modi’s guidance will infuse new energy and speed in the party’s dedicated work towards national interest and people’s welfare.The fifth-term MLA and first person from Bihar to head BJP’s organisation ticked off the party’s twin planks of Hindutva and nationalism in his inaugural address, which will be pored over by its rank and file, a large number of whom might not have heard much of him before he was appointed BJP working president last month. DMK ’s strident opposition to bid by Hindu groups to light a ‘deepam’ at a hilltop considered sacred by them was seized by BJP to mount a political challenge as the state heads to assembly polls.Nabin also flagged the decision by DMK and its allies to move a motion for removal of Madras high court Judge GR Swaminathan, who had decided in favour of Hindu groups, to target the parties. A division bench had later rejected state govt’s challenge to the verdict. He also voiced the party’s concerns over infiltration, which is a key part of its agenda in poll-bound Bengal and Assam.","Nitin Nabin, 45, is the 12th BJP president.

New Delhi: The Election Commission Tuesday told Supreme Court the Constitution empowers it to devise means, methods and procedure for preparation of voter lists for a free and fair election and asserted that its order for a pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has a legislative character.Continuing with the debate over the constitutional validity of SIR, proceedings for which began in Nov last year, EC counsel senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi SC had ruled that Article 324 of the Constitution enables the commission to devise ways and means where the statute, rules and regulations are silent on SIR. ""The nature of the revisional exercise is left to the discretion of the commission and would depend upon the prevalent circumstances. That is why the SIR exercise is uniform for all states except Assam, where the situation is different,"" Dwivedi said. ""Hence, 'preparation of electoral rolls', as envisaged in Article 324, needs to be widely construed as including the power of revision of electoral rolls.""Dwivedi said Article 324 read with Article 326 gives EC exclusive power to prepare electoral rolls for all elections to assemblies and Parliament, and ""during such preparation, including revision of electoral roll, it has exclusive power to consider whether the person claiming entitlement of enrolment is a citizen of India.""In an interesting deviation, Dwivedi, while reading SC's judgments, wondered as to why SC quoted Winston Churchill and William Pitts to give weight to their rulings holding voter and free and fair elections to be key to democracy. ""Both were colonists who were averse to giving rights to Indians even though Britain was a democracy,"" he said. Justice Bagchi said ancient India had a true democracy while that of Britain was an elitist one. ""Framers of the Constitution did not copy from the British system.

JAMMU: Operation Trashi-I, initiated to hunt and kill fleeing ultras in the hilly, forested region of Chatroo, in J&K’s Kishtwar district, entered its third day Tuesday even as security forces fortified the cordon and intensified the searches with the backing of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, officials said.The troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout in the district’s upper reaches and detained three-four locals from Sonnar village, near Mandral-Singhpora area, for questioning. “The recovery included vegetables, spices, 20kg of fine-quality rice, grains, 50 packets of Maggi, cooking gas, and dry wood,” said an official. Security personnel were trying to identify the overground workers who may have assisted the terrorists in transporting large quantities of assorted rations, utensils, and other consumable and logistic supplies, which were enough to provide sustenance during the winter months.Earlier on Tuesday, a wreath-laying ceremony was organised in Jammu to pay tributes to Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, who died Monday after suffering grenade splinter and bullet wounds during an overnight gun battle with terrorists during the ongoing operation. He was among eight soldiers wounded late Sunday when terrorists ambushed a joint Army–police search team in dense forests near Sonnar, close to the LoC.This was the first security force death in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026.The ceremony at Satwari was led by Brig Yudhvir Singh Sekhon, Officiating Chief of Staff, White Knight Corps. DIG (Jammu-Kathua-Samba Range) Shiv Kumar Sharma, Jammu Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Minhas, and several top police, CRPF and BSF officers paid tributes.

At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.","Operation Trashi-I, initiated to hunt and kill fleeing ultras in the hilly, forested region of Chatroo, in J&K’s Kishtwar district, entered its third day Tuesday.

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday rejected demands for further division of Jammu and Kashmir , and instead insisted on Ladakh’s reunification with J&K.He also dismissed PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ’s proposal for carving out Muslim majority areas of Jammu as a separate division of J&K, calling it an advocacy of the ‘Dixon Plan’ — a proposal made in Sept 1950 by Sir Owen Dixon, an Australian judge who came to the subcontinent as the UN representative to mediate between India and Pakistan following the latter’s invasion of Kashmir in 1947-48.“J&K state comprises Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, and the day is not far when Ladakh will again be part of Jammu and Kashmir,” Farooq told reporters in Jammu. “Ladakhis have not benefited from the region’s separation from Jammu and Kashmir. Even today, people in Ladakh want to be reunited with J&K, and do not want Union Territory status.”He summarily rejected the idea of separation of Jammu from Kashmir, saying: “Those demanding separate statehood for Jammu are ignorant and lack any understanding.”Countering BJP ’s allegation that NC and PDP thrived on unrest, Farooq said: “We have taken bullets for staying with India, and we are ready to take them again if needed.” It was “them (BJP), not us” who wanted to create disturbance, he asserted.A debate on further bifurcation of J&K started earlier this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma raised a pitch for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers”.While NC functionary and J&K’s deputy chief minister Surinder Choudhary on Monday categorically rejected the demand and called for Ladakh to be reunited with J&K, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti waded into the debate and floated a proposal for further division of Jammu instead.Mehbooba said the Pir Panjal region, comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts, and the Chenab Valley, comprising Doda and Kishtwar districts, should be carved out as separate divisions. All four districts are part of the Jammu division.Rejecting the demand, Farooq said: “It is the Dixon Plan. It was an old plan to divide J&K along the Chenab river, making it ‘Greater Kashmir’. But Parmar Sahib (first chief minister of Himachal Pradesh Y S Parmar) opposed any such division,” he said, adding that there is no need to carve out further divisions or districts in Jammu.BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur on Tuesday described Mehbooba’s demand for divisional status to Pir Panjal and Chenab Valley as “deeply conspiratorial, divisive and anti-national agenda that mirrors the long-standing strategy of Pakistan’s ISI”. “Mehbooba Mufti is not speaking for the people of Pir Panjal or Chenab Valley; she is repeating the language of Pakistan and its ISI, which has always dreamt of creating a so-called ‘Greater Kashmir’ by gradually absorbing Jammu’s Muslim-majority belts into Kashmir. This is a dangerous experiment on India’s sovereignty,” Thakur said.Reacting to the statements of Farooq and BJP, the PDP chief slammed NC and BJP for casting aspersions on her, saying her demand was purely administrative, and that her only agenda was to ensure development and better governance of these regions, which remained “neglected”.",National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah rejects demands for further division of Jammu and Kashmir.

Nearly 100 percent of applications are now being submitted and processed through the UCC portal, making the process completely faceless and eliminating the need for applicants to visit government offices or interact with officials in person.According to the government, robust safeguards ensure that citizens’ personal data remains confidential. Once an application is approved by a competent authority, officials can no longer access the applicant’s private information. The data can only be viewed by the applicant through a verification process, significantly reducing the risk of misuse or identity disclosure.Over the past year, residents have used the UCC platform for a range of services, including marriage and divorce registration, registration of wills, live-in relationship registration and termination of live-in relationships.Officials said certificates are now being issued in an average of five days, saving time and simplifying compliance.Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the implementation of the UCC had answered critics who had raised doubts about privacy and feasibility. ""Some people initially tried to create a negative atmosphere around the Uniform Civil Code. Over the past year, its implementation has proved that citizens’ privacy has been fully protected,"" he said.Dhami added that the smooth functioning of the UCC across the state reflected good governance and growing public confidence in the digital system underpinning the law.","One year after rollout of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in Uttarakhand, the state government says concerns over privacy violations have been effectively addressed.

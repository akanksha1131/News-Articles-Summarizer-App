‘Have to do everything not to …’: Zelenskyy’s measured message on India buying Russian oil; hopeful after meeting Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-to-do-everything-not-to-zelenskyys-measured-message-on-india-buying-russian-oil-hopeful-after-meeting-trump/articleshow/124082624.cms,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left), PM Narendra Modi (PTI)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that stronger diplomatic engagement between India and the West could prompt New Delhi to reconsider its energy imports from Russia. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy underscored the need to keep India aligned with the Western bloc amid the ongoing war with Russia.He also called on the West, particularly the United States and Europe, to deepen strategic engagement with India and discourage its energy ties with Russia.“We have to do everything not to withdraw India, and they'll change their attitude to the Russian energy sector. I'm sure,” Zelenskyy told Fox’s Bret Baier, suggesting that greater diplomatic efforts could encourage India to rethink its approach to sourcing energy from Russia.While acknowledging concerns over India’s energy imports, he expressed confidence in US President Donald Trump’s ability to manage those issues. “Yes, we had these questions with energy, but I think President Trump can manage it,” he said.His remarks came in the broader context of discussing global alignments, particularly countries perceived as closer to Russia. Commenting on Iran, the Ukrainian president stated: “Iran will never be on our side.Because it will never be on the side of the United States.”He went on to add, “I think India's mostly with us,” reinforcing his belief that India remains a potential strategic partner for the West.Zelenskyy also indicated that closer cooperation between Europe and India could help shift New Delhi’s position. “With Europeans, make more close and strong relationship with India,” he added.He also spoke positively about his recent interaction with Trump, describing him as supportive of Ukraine's position. “President Trump was more positive. He showed that he wants to support Ukraine to the very end,” Zelenskyy said.“We are ready to finish this war as soon as possible. He wants and I want and our people want,” he added, while also noting that Trump recognises the challenges posed by Russia. “He understands that Putin doesn't want that and is not winning but he says to everyone that he’ll win.”","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that stronger diplomatic engagement between India and the West could prompt New Delhi to reconsider its energy imports from Russia.

How India’s airlines turn delays into before-time arrival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indias-airlines-turn-delays-into-before-time-arrival/articleshow/124081226.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Choked airports, weather events, maintenance and staff woes, there’s much that can hold up flight operations. But carriers have a simple strategy to stay on top of flight schedules: inflating the duration of the journey

Wide margins

Bragging rights

Blame game

Depending on which airline you choose to fly, the travel time mentioned in the ticket for a Delhi-Mumbai flight can be less than two hours or stretch to almost three. How’s that possible? Most airlines fly either Boeing or Airbus planes, so they fly at roughly the same speed, more or less at the same altitude, and follow similar routes. So, how do you account for the extra one hour of flying time? That’s where OTP comes in. No, not the one-time password you are so familiar with, but On-Time Performance. Airlines, which, understandably, make a virtue out of punctuality, have long since realised that the safest way to ensure an on-time (or even before-time) performance is by inflating the journey time. That makes late arrival rather difficult.Basically, airlines do a careful calculation of all factors at play from before a plane takes off till it lands. To be fair, there are many factors an airline doesn’t control. Like bad weather or congestion on the ground and in air before landing in some choked airport like Delhi or Mumbai. Some, though, are very much the responsibility of airlines, like ensuring there are no snags and taking care of other logistical issues like making sure crew are present.Technically, a flight needs to be pushed back from the boarding gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time to be counted as an on-time departure for the purpose of flight statistics, which are maintained by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The scheduled departure and arrival time of a flight is calculated keeping the historical and seasonal flying time (from getting airborne to touchdown) between the origin and destination city pairs and the taxi time at either airport. This is known as the “chocks off” to “chocks on” time, referring to the wedges placed in front and behind aircraft wheels before it is pushed back and after it lands to prevent accidental rolling when parked.“The usual Delhi-Mumbai flying time is one hour and 40 minutes. Add to that 10 minutes of taxi each at IGIA (Delhi) and CSMIA (Mumbai), giving a total time of two hours. Then, to factor in airport congestion and hovering at destination, the taxi time was increased to, from 20 to, say, 27 minutes. Some airlines added further buffer to their block time — the time an aircraft can start taxiing to the time it comes to a halt at its destination — to ensure they can announce an on-time arrival,” said one pilot. If these inflated flying times are about airlines being smart, it is also a practice that has been driven by growing competition and hectic schedules.Therefore, unless you are flying on a particularly bad weather day, or a particularly unreliable airline with poor aircraft maintenance/unpaid employees/jet fuel suppliers, or to and from particularly choked airport/s, you are unlikely to miss the boast of “another on-time arrival” on touchdown at the destination by the crew. Queries to big and upcoming airlines — Air India, IndiGo and Akasa — on this issue went unanswered.It was in 2003 that Indian skies started getting low-cost carriers (LCCs) that democratised air travel. And, with that, air traffic, terminal and runway congestion, too, became a fact of life.“About two decades back, the total travel time from Delhi to Mumbai was given as 1 hour and 55 minutes. Then, congestion checked in and planes would routinely get delayed on ground and in air. Some smart private airlines started adding a buffer to the journey time to report on-time arrivals. Soon, almost everyone started to do the same, at least on city pairs with choked airports,” said a pilot with over four decades of flying experience. Which brings us to today, when the exact same aircraft type often has different travel times on the same sector. But there’s more here than would appear obvious.Arriving ahead of or on schedule triggers a virtuous cascading effect for the airline: the plane can then operate its next flight on time as well with the same buffer for the flight after and so on. That is unless it’s caught in a big weather event like heavy rain or fog or develops a snag en-route or on landing and has to be grounded for checks and maintenance. But there are other reasons why there can be no fixed or standard travel time between two destinations common to all airlines.How long it takes to fly between any two destinations depends on a number of things, like the routings given (direct or not), weather, wind flow and airport congestion. “If an aircraft gets tailwinds, it will reach its destination faster while headwinds will slow it down. Winters see strong west-to-east jetstreams, which means an Ahmedabad-Kolkata flight could take 10-15 minutes less than the Kolkata-Ahmedabad journey and a LondonDelhi nonstop can take up to two hours less than the Delhi-London,” said a senior commander.DGCA issues monthly reports for domestic air travel that include, among other data points, OTP data of scheduled domestic airlines based on inputs from six metro airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata. This “data” is crucial for airlines to project themselves as punctual in the eyes of the domestic traveller.But tinkering with travel times is not done just for reasons of OTP. Sometimes, Indian carriers that operate long hauls, say between Delhi and London, report an under 10-hour flying time to ensure they can make do with two pilots. Reporting journey time of over 10 hours means they will have to fly with three pilots, which adds to their cost and also requires them to inform DGCA. The regulator routinely flags this issue with Indian carriers whenever it detects anomalies over under-reporting of travel time with a view to carrying fewer than required pilots.When it comes to reporting inflated travel times on domestic routes, it may suit the airline well, though it also creates several problems on ground.Airlines and operators of busy airports blame each other for air traffic congestion, which is among the potential delays factored in while inflating journey times. While airlines say delays in getting clearance for take-off from or landing at choked hubs is beyond their control, airport operators say that flights failing to operate on time upsets their slot allocation and accentuates OTP issues.“Airport slots are given per schedules filed by airlines. If airlines don’t adhere to that and planes come ahead of, or after, the time they were supposed to land, then it overlaps with the slot given to some other airline. While some mismatch is understandable depending on weather conditions and routings on a given day, what we see is significant distortion in schedules,” said a senior official at one of India’s busiest airports.But going ahead, things could improve as India is now seeing a boom in airport infra with Delhi-NCR and Mumbai MMR going to get their secondary airports and Hyderabad and Bengaluru adding to their facilities. Many constrained places like Patna and Chennai, too, will get second airports.On the airline front, India is now seeing well-funded players like IndiGo and Tata’s Air India Group along with emerging players like Akasa, Star Air and others. These airlines focus on maintaining their young fleets, which, along with added airport infra, should cut down delays to an extent that airlines don’t need to inflate travel times in a desperate bid to win brownie points with flyers.","Airlines inflate the duration of the journey to stay on top of flight schedules. Airline do a careful calculation of all factors at play from before a plane takes off till it lands. If a flight needs to be pushed back from the boarding gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time, it is counted as an on- time departure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124081237,imgsize-583676,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Railways will run around 12,000 special trains to clear the festive rush during Diwali and Chhath, and going by estimates, these would carry around three crore additional passengers - more than Australia's population - over 45 days, beginning Oct 1.Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Tuesday said another 150 completely unreserved trains will be kept ready to clear last minute rush. Till Tuesday, 10,000 special trains have been notified, and more will be announced gradually in line with demand, he said.Last year, the national transporter operated 7,724 special trains carrying around 1.5 crore additional passengers during the festive season.Vaishnaw said over 90% punctuality has been achieved in 29 of 70 railway divisions. On launch of Vande Bharat sleeper trains, he said the first rake is ready for rollout. ""But we will start operations after getting another rake, which will arrive by Oct 15,"" he said. Officials did not rule out the possibility of the first train going to poll-bound Bihar.","Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Tuesday said another 150 completely unreserved trains will be kept ready to clear last minute rush.

Rajnath Singh launches Indian company's defence unit near Casablanca,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-singh-launches-indian-companys-defence-unit-near-casablanca/articleshow/124080891.cms,"Rajnath Singh & Moroccan trade minister Ryad Mezzour in Rabat

NEW DELHI: A modern defence manufacturing facility for armoured vehicles near Casablanca in Morocco, the first such Indian private sector plant in Africa, was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Abdelatif Loudyi Tuesday.The facility, set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (WhAP 8x8), which it has jointly designed with DRDO. Equipped with advanced mobility, protection and mission adaptability, the WhAP can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle; armoured personnel carrier; reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier; and even an ambulance.Singh said India’s vision of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ is not just to manufacture defence platforms and tech for its own needs, but to develop capabilities that allow the country to become a credible source of advanced technology and high-quality products for the world.“For India, self-reliance does not mean isolation. Rather, we aim to develop strategic autonomy. We want to develop capabilities that allow us to defend our nation independently, while maintaining engagement with global partners. Along with ‘Make in India’, we are pursuing ‘Make with Friends’ & ‘Make for World’,” he added.Describing the occasion as “a historic moment” in the evolving bilateral strategic partnership, Singh said Morocco’s strategic location as a gateway to Africa and Europe makes the TASL facility an important hub for exports and collaboration.Spread over 20,000 square metres, the facility will begin delivering WhAP 8x8 vehicles to Royal Moroccan Army from next month.","The facility, set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (WhAP 8x8) Equipped with advanced mobility, protection and mission adaptability, the WhAP can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle, armoured personnel carrier, reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier and even an ambulance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124080889,imgsize-896745,width-400,resizemode-4/article-23.jpg"
"Gallery owner made 15.7 crore by selling fake art, charges ED",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gallery-owner-made-15-7cr-by-selling-fake-art-charges-ed/articleshow/124080812.cms,"MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet in a money laundering case related to a cartel involved in the sale of fake artworks. Naming art gallery owner Rajesh Rajpal and lawyer Vishwang Desai, ED has alleged that Rajpal received proceeds of crime worth Rs 15.7 crore generated through the sale of fake paintings, whereas Desai acted as the sole intermediary, curating art options, negotiating terms and vouching for authenticity of the works before prospective buyers.The cartel allegedly traded in counterfeit works claiming they were by the likes of M F Husain, F N Souza and other prominent artists.The chargesheet also names Abhishek Jain, Manish Sakariya and Rare Art Gallery Pvt Ltd, saying Jain and Sakariya assisted in layering the proceeds of crime.According to the chargesheet, the accused had prepared forged certificates of authenticity and provenance of paintings, including an unsigned certificate pertaining to a painting allegedly by F N Souza, and duped a businessman buyer, who is the complainant in the case.ED's money laundering case is based on a cheating case registered at Tardeo police station in 2024.Earlier, the police had filed a closure report in the case, terming the dispute as being of 'civil nature' since the accused had returned Rs 2.2 crore to the complainant from the total money he received. However, the magistrate's court rejected the report and ordered police further investigation against Rajpal and Desai.ED claimed that by creating and circulating fabricated documents, Desai enabled Rajpal to misrepresent forged artworks as genuine, thereby inducing the complainant to part with Rs 15.7 crore through banking channels. Subsequently, some of this amount was withdrawn, with no clarity on its recipient or use.ED asserted that Desai's role extended beyond generating the proceeds of crime to projecting them as untainted property in Rajpal's hands. Although ED was unable to find a money trail directly linking it to Desai, it maintained that his active connivance and deliberate assistance allowed Rajpal to integrate and layer the illicit funds into the financial system under the guise of genuine art sales.","The cartel allegedly traded in counterfeit works claiming they were by the likes of M F Husain, F N Souza and other prominent artists.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also closely aligns with broader efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification measures, and fully digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working diligently to overhaul its immigration systems to significantly reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent.

NEW DELHI: Days after US President announced an exorbitant fee hike in H-1B visa fees, the White House is mulling exempting for physicians from the new fees, news agency Bloomberg reported on Monday.""The Proclamation allows for potential exemptions, which can include physicians and medical residents,"" Bloomberg quoted White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers saying in an email.This comes after Trump issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The new fee took effect came in effect on 12.01 am on September 21, 2025, prompting immigration attorneys and companies to advise H-1B holders or their families currently outside the US to return immediately or risk being stranded.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.Earlier, the government expressed serious concern over a raise in the H-1B visa fee, calling it a potential disruption for skilled Indian professionals and their families in the United States.In an official statement, the spokesperson said the full implications are being studied, noting that Indian industry has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to the H-1B program.“Industry in both India and the US has a stake in innovation and creativity and can be expected to consult on the best path forward,” the statement said.It highlighted that talent mobility has contributed enormously to technology development, innovation, economic growth, competitiveness, and wealth creation in both countries.“Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,” the spokesperson added.","The White House is mulling exempting for physicians from the new fees.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury.

MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am. It departed Navi Mumbai airport at 12:40am on Sunday and took the land route to Ahmedabad.Over the weekend, the flight also landed on X, with @hiravaero posting a clip of the landing captured by Sandeep Pilania, a plane spotter. Industry experts pointed out that the new Navi Mumbai airport has other firsts still to come. The most awaited among these will be the first scheduled commercial airline flight.While PM Modi is set to inaugurate the airport and its terminal building on September 30, the commissioning of the airport, after the security sweeping and other procedures, is likely to take a few more months.But the landing or take-off of the first airline flight carrying fare-paying passengers will be the most significant milestone, as it would signal the start of a major capacity boost for Mumbai's overstretched airport infrastructure.","The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day.

RUDRAPUR: A man from Udham Singh Nagar who had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies was allegedly coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine, his family said, adding they have had no contact with him since early Sept and are now desperate for help. The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months.

Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements.

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday welcomed the release of senior party leader Azam Khan from Sitapur jail. He described it as a “matter of relief and joy” not only for him and his family but also for those who believe in justice.In a post on X, Yadav wrote, “The release of the honorable Azam Khan ji is a matter of relief and joy not only for him and his family and all of us, but also for all those people who have faith in justice. Heartfelt thanks to the court for upholding faith in justice.”Targeting the ruling BJP , he said those who filed “fake cases” against Khan have now learned that “every lie has an expiry date and so does every conspiracy.”The former CM added that Azam Khan would continue to stand with the neglected and the oppressed and remain a symbol of “emotional unity” while carrying forward the struggle for social justice with socialist values.Speaking to reporters, Yadav reiterated his gratitude to the court and expressed hope that no fresh “false cases” would be filed by the BJP government in the state.“SP leader Azam Khan has been released from jail. I would like to thank the Court for this. We, the Samajwadis, believed that the Court would do justice. We hope that in the time to come, no false cases will be filed and no injustice will be done by the BJP,” he said.The SP chief stressed that Azam Khan has played a crucial role in the party’s long fight against the BJP. He further promised that, just as BJP leaders have had cases withdrawn against them, a future Samajwadi Party government would withdraw all “false cases” filed against Khan.Samajwadi Party leader and six-time MLA from Jaswantnagar, Shivpal Singh Yadav , who had come to receive Azam Khan, also hit out at the Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath-led government.He alleged that Khan was “framed” in false cases and welcomed the court’s decision to grant him bail. “Azam Khan was framed by the government in false cases. However, the court has granted him bail and has provided relief to him in cases. I welcome this decision. Many false cases were filed against him.

His lawyer has maintained that many of the cases were politically motivated, with several already withdrawn, discharged or pending trial.","Azam Khan released from Sitapur jail on Tuesday after spending nearly 23 months in custody.

LONDON: Booker Prize -winning Indian author Kiran Desai is a favorite to win the coveted fiction trophy for a second time with her first novel in two decades.""The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny"" is on a US-dominated six-book shortlist announced Tuesday by a judging panel that includes Irish writer Roddy Doyle and actor Sarah Jessica Parker. The almost 700-page tale of two young Indians making their way in the United States is Desai's third novel and her first since ""The Inheritance of Loss,"" which won the Booker Prize in 2006.Two previous Booker finalists are up for the 50,000 ($68,000) prize again: U.K. writer Andrew Miller for ""The Land in Winter,"" set during an early-1960s cold snap, and Hungarian-British writer David Szalay for ""Flesh,"" which charts one man's life across decades.Three novels by Americans complete the list: Susan Choi's family saga ""Flashlight""; Katie Kitamura's tale of acting and identity, ""Audition""; and midlife-crisis road trip ""The Rest of Our Lives"" by Ben Markovits.Doyle - a Booker winner himself in 1993 for ""Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha"" - said the six books tackle big issues, including migration and class, in a ""brilliantly human"" way.""They all follow the human in the stories,"" Doyle said. ""That might seem a bit trite, but I've read novels where I've often felt to myself, if there was a little bit less showing off there would be a good story there.And I don't think any of these books show off.""Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan, Hilary Mantel and Samantha Harvey, who won last year with ""Orbital.""Past winners have included debut novels - from Arundhati Roy's ""The God of Small Things"" in 1997 to Douglas Stuart's ""Shuggie Bain"" in 2020 - but this year's list is dominated by veterans.

Minor volcanic activity has been reported twice this month at Barren Island, India’s only active volcano, officials said on Monday.The eruptions occurred on September 13 and September 20 but were described as mild in nature, with no immediate threat to nearby areas, PTI reported.Located in the Andaman Sea, about 138 km northeast of Port Blair, Barren Island is South Asia's only active volcano.The remote island, spans roughly 3 sq km, is largely covered by volcanic cones and ash, with sparse vegetation visible from a distance. Rising 354 metres above sea level, it remains a striking geological feature of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.Barren Island has a recorded history of eruptions dating back to 1787. Since then, it has witnessed several episodes of activity, including significant eruptions in 2017 and 2022, the latest being in July this year.Officials continue to monitor the island closely, though the recent events have been classified as minor and pose no immediate risk to human settlements.","Minor volcanic activity has been reported twice this month at Barren Island.

VARANASI/NEW DELHI: A hijack scare gripped an Air India Express flight from Bengaluru to Varanasi Monday after a man tried to unlock the cockpit door mid-air by entering random digits on its keypad, triggering a security buzzer inside the flight deck.Cabin crew confronted the passenger, identified as Mani R, who claimed he was a first-time flyer looking for the lavatory. He returned to his seat, but the move prompted the captain of Flight IX-1086, a Boeing 737, to alert Varanasi ATC.Despite his explanation, the alarm was taken seriously as Mani had allegedly punched the correct cockpit code, police sources said. A passenger posted on X: ""An @AirIndiaX passenger tried to open the cockpit door... He even punched the right passcode, but the captain didn't open the door, fearing a hijack. The passenger was flying with eight others."" The crew's refusal to open the door prevented further escalation.

Poll Do you think the criticism of Bengaluru's road conditions by industry leaders and opposition parties is justified? Yes, they have a valid point No, it's exaggerated

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday wrote to Wipro founder Azim Premji seeking the IT giant’s support in tackling traffic congestion on Bengaluru’s Outer Ring Road (ORR). The letter comes amid growing criticism from industry leaders and opposition parties over the city’s crumbling road infrastructure.In his letter, Siddaramaiah praised Wipro’s role in Karnataka’s development but flagged severe congestion at the Iblur junction, particularly during peak hours. He suggested that opening limited vehicular movement through Wipro’s campus, under agreed terms and security checks, could significantly ease the problem.“One of the key challenges currently facing Bengaluru, particularly along the Outer Ring Road corridor at Iblur junction is severe traffic congestion during peak hours, which adversely impacts mobility, productivity, and the quality of urban life,” Siddaramaiah wrote.Citing expert assessments, he added: “Preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicate that such a measure could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30%, particularly during peak office hours.Your support in this matter will go a long way in easing traffic bottlenecks, enhancing commuter experience, and contributing to a more efficient and livable Bengaluru.”The chief minister urged Wipro’s management to work with state officials to find a “mutually acceptable plan at the earliest.”The appeal comes against the backdrop of heightened public debate on Bengaluru’s infrastructure. Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai and Biocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw recently urged the government to act after logistics platform BlackBuck shifted operations out of Bellandur, citing poor commuting conditions.Meanwhile, deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has defended the government, saying the pothole problem is not unique to Karnataka. “It is there across the country, including in Delhi. Projecting in the media as if the issue is only here is not right,” he told reporters. He added that civic teams are filling around a thousand potholes daily despite heavy rains.With the opposition BJP set to stage a statewide road blockade protest on 24 September, the ruling Congress faces mounting pressure to show quick progress on improving Bengaluru’s roads.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote to Wipro founder Azim Premji seeking the IT giant's support in tackling traffic congestion on Bengaluru's Outer Ring Road.

Party netas dismissed his remarks as false propaganda aimed at weakening the organisation, accu-sing him of using talk of ceasefire and peace as a pretext for surrender. Telangana's Special Intelligence Branch confirmed the committee's instructions but said there was no confirmation of Venugopal's expulsion.The dispute escalated after a press release dated Aug 15 and attributed to Maoist spokesperson Abhay, suggested the group intended to ""temporarily renounce arm-ed struggle"" and ""lay down arms"". The central committee and politburo rejected the stand, insisting it was Venugopal's personal view. Traditionally, statements are issued under the alias Abhay, a role Venugopal assumed after the 2010 encounter killing of spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar.Venugopal has been underground since the late 1970s. A Brahmin from Telangana with a commerce degree, he is regarded more as a political ideologue than a field commander. He is the younger brother of Mallojula Koteshwar Rao, or Kishenji, a politburo member killed in a 2011 encounter in Bengal.

Earthquake triggered volcano eruption on Andaman's island on September 20: Expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/earthquake-triggered-volcano-eruption-on-andamans-island-on-september-20-expert/articleshow/124080558.cms,"The eruption on Barren Island

Such episodic volcanic eruption witnessed in 1991, '04 & '05: Official

India's only active volcano located on the uninhabited Barren Island in Andaman Sea erupted on Sept 20, presenting a visual extravaganza rare for south Asia. The episode was in fact the result of an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 that hit the region two days before the event.Though the eruption was minor with no immediate risk to human settlements in Indonesian archipelago, the episode - fourth since 1991 - can't be overlooked as the island lies over a fault that moved, causing the Dec 2004 tsunami.The fault's coordinates fall on the same latitude as the Barren Island volcano and in the vicinity of the longitude of the quake that made the magma chamber apt for ""pre-mature magmatic eruption"", said O P Mishra, director, National Centre for Seismology.O P Mishra said it was ""earthquake shaking intensity"" in magma chamber of Barren volcano that erupted this month. Barren Island is roughly circular with a diameter of approximately 3.2km where the volcano rises nearly 2km above the sea floor. Its average height is 300m above mean sea level.""Andaman-Nicobar Island is located in the subduction complex consisting of the down going Indian plate intruding to the mantle of the overriding Sunda Plate where continuous earthquakes of moderate to strong strengths used to occur besides the micro seismicity in the area,"" said Mishra.There are two magma related lava volcanoes located along active West Andaman Fault. Though Barren Volcano has been active for years, the eruption is intermittent and sporadic as and when magma chamber at the depths of 18-20km are activated. Lava and magmatic eruptions occur from time to time due to disturbance of the magma chamber by seismic energy generated from strong to moderate earthquakes that upwelled lavas to the surface through volcanic vents. ""This type of episodic volcanic eruption was witnessed in 1991, 2004, 2005, and now in 2025,"" said Mishra.He said the lava and magma persists and remains in the moving state and is pushed upward once the 'earthquake shaking' tries to bring the hot materials to the surface through cracks and fractures widened by the continuous seismically active cycle. The other volcano in the region, Narcondam, is, however, dormant at present.","India's only active volcano located on the uninhabited Barren Island in Andaman Sea erupted on Sept 20. The episode was in fact the result of an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 that hit the region two days before the event. Though the eruption was minor with no immediate risk to human settlements in Indonesian archipelago, the episode can't be overlooked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124080561,imgsize-452391,width-400,resizemode-4/article-12.jpg"

real-time early warning system

for project: Panel

NEW DELHI: An expert appraisal committee of the Union environment ministry has granted clearance to the 2,220MW Oju hydroelectric project located in a strategically important region in Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district bordering China.One of the largest run-of-river hydro projects in India, it will cost around Rs 25,000 crore and is likely to take at least five years to be completed. It is India's third-largest hydroelectric project to get environmental clearance after the 3,087MW Etalin and 2,880MW Dibang project, both also in Arunachal.Oju is the largest in a series of dams proposed on Subansiri river and has been in the pipeline for nearly 20 years. It involves a 100-metre-high concrete gravity dam, over 14 km long headrace tunnel and an underground powerhouse complex.The expert appraisal committee, while giving its nod for the project earlier this month, directed the developer to include 'glacial lake outburst floods' scenarios in the design flood estimates, establish a real-time early warning system and conduct community preparedness drills. The panel has also mandated a post-commissioning environmental impact study after five years.","Oju hydroelectric project located in strategically important region in Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district bordering China.

Polluted river water unusable even for animals

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday took suo motu cognisance of media reports about lives and livelihood of two million people being adversely impacted by severe pollution of Jojari river near Jodhpur because of discharge of untreated waste water by more than 400 steel rolling and textile units. The court said it would pass a comprehensive order on Oct 9 for the river's ""restoration"".A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta told Rajasthan's additional advocate general Siv Mangal Sharma that National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already taken cognisance of Jojari's pollution, and said remedial steps are to be taken urgently to save it. Sharma said several directions by NGT have been challenged in SC and are pending adjudication.Jojari is a seasonal river, which originates in Pandalu village of Nagaur, and after joining Luni river at Balotra flows through the limits of Jodhpur. For the past two decades, the untreated discharge of chemicals from over 400 textile and steel units has rendered the river water unusable even for animals, impacting the lives of residents of 50 villages along it Jodhpur-Barmer stretch.The river is the source of drinking water for villagers in the Thar desert.Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board also noted, ""Farmers use the water. Consumption of such agricultural products can have adverse effects on the human body as toxic heavy metals are present.""Apart from the pH value, the total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and oil and grease quantities in the samples taken from Jojari were found to be much higher than the prescribed standards, the report said. There are reports of people migrating from villages adjoining the river because of severe water shortage. The biodiversity of the area has also suffered with flora and fauna disappearing.","Jojari is a seasonal river, which originates in Pandalu village of Nagaur.

Rampur's parkour pioneers turn ruins into launchpads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rampurs-parkour-pioneers-turn-ruins-into-launchpads/articleshow/124080232.cms,"Members of Rampur’s Team Leonine in action

'Started off by copying

Jackie Chan

, got to know much later parkour was a sport'

MEERUT: In Rampur, a city better known for its royal past, a group of young men has turned remnants of that history into something else. Disused courtyards, locked playgrounds and Nawabi-era structures aren't tourist spots - they're practice grounds. For nearly two decades, a group of self-taught athletes has used these overlooked spaces to train in parkour long before most people here knew the word.Some of them would later carry these moves into Bollywood. Aman Kumar, who trained with the group, moved to Mumbai and began working in films. ""I've done stunts in 'Baaghi 4', 'Sultan', 'Devara' - stuff like that,"" he said. ""Directors like working with parkour artists because we don't rely on wires. We know how to land, how to adapt to real locations. There's more control, less need for editing around mistakes.""It began in 2007, when Mujahid Habib, then a teenager, realised the jumping, swinging and vaulting he did for fun had a name, and a global community. ""We used to give our moves random names, copying stunts from Jackie Chan movies,"" he said. ""Then we saw Hrithik Roshan do similar jumps in 'Dhoom 2', and my friend Waseem told me it was actually a sport, parkour.That's when I saw it as something bigger.""Habib kept practising on staircases, rooftops, drains using whatever was available. In 2009, he formed Team Leonine with five others. ""We used to go out at 5am,"" said Aamir Zameer Khan, a founding member. ""We trained on the Kosi riverbank as the sand helped with landings. Then we moved to Nahid Ground. It was always locked, so we started jumping a 10-foot-wide drain to get in.""Parkour also gave them a reason to explore their surroundings differently. ""We began looking for places that could push us - rooftops, old buildings, broken structures,"" said Hassan Khan. ""Some thought we were up to no good. Others would stop and watch. A few gave us fruit or water. It was never the same reaction twice.""They moved through Rampur, trying to read the city physically. Every alley, gate and rooftop was a chance to test technique, timing, nerves. At first, people didn't know what to make of them. Some thought they were trespassing. Others warned them to stop. ""A few even threatened to call the police,"" said Aamir. ""But some people got it. They'd bring chai or snacks. A fruit vendor once handed me a guava after watching us train all morning. ""By 2013, Habib's work had started getting noticed. That year, he won a national parkour competition in Mumbai sponsored by an energy drink brand. The prize took him to Greece, where he saw his first international event.""That trip changed how I thought about what we were doing,"" Habib said.""We had started without knowing others were doing the same. It made everything feel connected,"" he added.","Rampur's self-taught parkour athletes have been practising for two decades.

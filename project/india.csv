Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The prospect of disruption looms over an already truncated winter session of Parliament as a united opposition on Sunday pressed for a discussion on SIR, an issue that had all but washed out the previous session, as govt remained non-committal to its demand.At an all-party meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress and a host of other opposition parties also sought debate on several other issues, including national security following the Delhi blast, and rising air pollution, but the nationwide Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls emerged as their rallying point.Ram Gopal Yadav of SP, whose contingent of 37 Lok Sabha members is the second largest in the opposition, sent out an ominous message as the 19-day session covering 15 sitting begins Monday. “We will not allow Parliament to function if a discussion is not held on SIR,” he said, alleging the review of rolls is marred by irregularities and that some booth-level officers ended their lives due to stress. Many SP lawmakers, including him, have been put on “C category” (requiring more documentation), as a targeted segment of voters is being deleted from rolls, he claimed.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told the opposition that he would get back to them on their demand after consulting key govt functionaries, but gave no assurance.Rijiju had in the last session cited a ruling by then LS Speaker Balram Jakhar in 1988, when Congress was in office, that the House could not debate decisions and functioning of Election Commission to reject opposition’s demand for a discussion on SIR.The opposition’s protest had washed out LS and Rajya Sabha proceedings, except for a discussion on Operation Sindoor, in that session.At Sunday’s meeting, BJP ally and JDU working president Sanjay Jha made light of the opposition's case against SIR by highlighting that its strident stand cut little ice with people in Bihar, the first state where it was carried out, and no voter or political party came forward with any official complaint.In the meeting attended by 50 representatives from 36 parties, govt shared 14 items, including 13 bills, of its tentative agenda and sought the opposition’s support. Rijiju conveyed govt’s keenness on a discussion of Vande Mataram, the national song whose 150th anniversary was observed with much fervour recently by BJP-led NDA.Congress later held a strategy meet of its key leaders with sources saying the party was veering to the stand that the demand for a SIR discussion was non-negotiable.In business advisory meetings of LS and RS, in which govt and opposition functionaries work out Parliament’s agenda, the deadlock remained. Some opposition members, including CPM’s John Brittas, suggested a short-duration discussion on electoral reforms to get around govt’s unwillingness to discuss SIR as the issue can also cover the ongoing exercise in 12 states and UTs.",Opposition pressed for a discussion on Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls.

Airbus A320 Glitch: Ex-IAF Pilot Shows How ELAC 2 Fails In Real-Time Flight Simulation

NEW DELHI: As a Rs 50,000-crore sword hangs over air travellers at Delhi and Mumbai airports, the Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA), which has now reachedSupreme Court, where the matter will be heard on Dec 3.The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB)"", the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services, for the first two years of these airports during the PPP era, which started about 20 years ago.After a protracted legal battle followed by the recent Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) judgment, the case has now reached SC, where the two operators of the Delhi and Mumbai airports, DIAL and MIAL, have challenged the tribunal's order striking down theirRs 50,000-crore HRAB claim.""Aviation ministry is going to back AERA in this case as the implications of fares on air travellers are immense. If the private operators of Delhi and Mumbai airports win the case, we are looking at about Rs 50,000 crore getting due to these two operators, which could mean a manifold hike in both user development fees (UDF) paid directly by passengers, and airline landing and parking charges that air carriers factor in while calculating airfares.Overall, the burden for passengers could increase majorly. So, govt has decided to back AERA completely,"" officials said, adding UDF alone could rise by about nine times in Delhi and 21 times in Mumbai.Civil aviation ministry estimates domestic UDF at Delhi could rise from Rs 129 by almost 10 times to Rs 1,261, and at Mumbai from Rs 175 by 22 times to Rs 3,856.In early 2006, Delhi and Mumbai airports were handed over to private players for being developed in PPP (public private partnership) mode. Until then, the state-run Airports Authority of India used to have common charges for all its airports.AERA, which determines tariffs for major airports, came into being in mid-2009. ""The dispute essentially is for the period between the airports being handed over to GMR Group in Delhi and the then GVK Group in Mumbai, and the time when AERA started deciding aeronautical tariffs. If this amount of Rs 50,000 crore becomes due to the developers, the same will be recovered through passengers paying more, and this has to be fought tooth and nail legally. Aviation ministry will do just that,"" said sources.""DIAL and MIAL want a much higher value of assets they got in 2006. What were the assets that time at the two ariports? Run-down terminals barely worth a few hundred crores. They want value of non-aero assets to be added in the regulatory asset base. If that happens and value of non-aero development like hotels, malls and other commercial development is added, the entire model of brownfield airport development will go for a toss as it will come too expensive for users,"" officials said.","The Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB),"" the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday asked Congress to give account of “loot by its leaders” in the National Herald case instead of levelling baseless allegations against the govt after Delhi Police filed an FIR against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi along with their six other associates and business entities in the matter on an array of criminal charges.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad rejected Congress’s allegation of political vendetta and said the case predates Modi govt. “The nation should know that Young Indian in which Sonia and Rahul own 38% share each, acquired assets worth thousands of crores belonging to AJL, which was held by Congress and owned by National Herald, with only Rs 50 lakh.”“It is clearly a case of loot. The law is taking its course, and Congress should let it,” he said, underlining Congress pleas in HC and SC to get proceedings against its members quashed were rejected and the judiciary asked them to face trial. On the FIR, he said Sonia & Rahul have been slapped with charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating. ED probed the charges, reached a conclusion and now asked police to lodge an FIR.","Ravi Shankar Prasad rejects Congress’s allegation of political vendetta and said the case predates Modi govt. “It is clearly a case of loot.

He called it ""one trick wonder of a case where no money moved, where no immovable property was transferred, yet money laundering was invented upon creation of Young Indian as not-for-profit company to merely hold share of AJL - which runs and holds brand National Herald and continues to hold all property as before and as always"".He said the grounds for money laundering were absent in the case, while the Gandhis and other Congress functionaries don't get any dividends or perks.

GUWAHATI: Successive govts in Assam allowed the state's ""land and identity crisis"" to fester for four decades while they kept under wraps a report that had flagged it as a ticking time bomb that led to the 1983 Nellie massacre, among other disturbances.The Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary Commission, tasked by the then Congress govt to investigate the Jan-April 1983 cycle of violence accompanying the anti-foreigner movement of the time, made multiple recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, evicting infiltrators, defining ""Assamese"" identity, and safeguarding it.The first AGP ministry tabled the report in the assembly in 1987, but its contents were never revealed, much less discussed for implementation. The BJP-led govt made the report public this week, 41 years after it was signed, sealed and delivered.Contrary to decades of narratives framing the disturbances of 1983 as communal, the Tewary report notes that any such interpretation would be ""a very superficial view"". It also points out that ""all sections of society suffered as a result of the senseless violence"" and that the victims ""were not confined to one religious, ethnic or linguistic group"".""Many perceptive witnesses have gone into this historical aspect and interpreted the disturbances as clashes of economic interests. In many cases, they arose out of land disputes,"" the former judge writes, describing illegal occupation of land by immigrants as ""one of the greatest irritants"" for the Assamese people.""Land has been the main attraction for illegal immigrants,"" the report says, seeking to drive home the point that fears of the indigenous population being overrun were ""not imaginary"".The report cites census figures and testimonies of responsible witnesses, including erstwhile British administrators and census commissioners ""who did not suffer either from pride or prejudice, nor had any personal or group interest in the matter"".Tewary notes in the 1984 report that ""ejectment of encroachment stopped in 1979"". He mentions that infiltrator detection and encroacher removal are ""inseparably linked"", suggesting that both must be carried out by a multi-disciplinary task force led by magistrates and backed by armed police rather than leaving the task to junior officials.The report warns that immovable property should not be transferred into the hands of non-Assamese, recommending ""reasonable restrictions"" even on Indian citizens from outside the state. ""While defining who is an Assamese for this purpose, a reference to the National Register of Citizens or a minimum period of domicile in Assam or/and such other conditions, as might be found reasonable, may be examined.""On immigrants, the report distinguishes between two categories - refugees fleeing persecution in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and those who migrated primarily in search of land and economic opportunities.""Those who have been victims of persecution deserve all sympathy and support which has been the consistent national policy. Some of them have already been admitted as Indian citizens and granted citizenship certificates. The remaining should be deemed to be the citizens of India,"" the report says.This distinction between migrants from Bangladesh is similar to what was outlined later in CAA.","Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary Commission made recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, defining ‘Assamese’ identity and safeguarding it.

Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders.

After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as Punjab ’s captain, Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Sent out to open after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former SunRisers Hyderabad teammate Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault was astonishing.

Palash Muchhal-Smriti Mandhana Wedding Row - New Twist?

Indian women's cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer Palash Muchhal 's wedding, scheduled for November 23, has been postponed due to unexpected health emergencies.The postponement came after Mandhana's father, Shriniwas, fell ill on the wedding day and required hospitalization. The following day, Palash Muchhal was also admitted to a hospital in Sangli, Mandhana's hometown, before being transferred to Mumbai for treatment.The wedding delay was officially announced by Mandhana's manager, citing the health emergencies as the reason for the postponement.Following the postponement, Mandhana removed all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account, though some casual photographs with Palash remain visible. Both Shriniwas and Palash have since been discharged from the hospital, but the families have not yet announced a new wedding date.Social media users have noticed that both Mandhana and Muchhal have updated their Instagram bios with the 'nazar' (evil eye) emoticon, sparking further discussion about the situation.Family members from both sides have emphasised that the wedding's postponement is solely due to the health emergencies that occurred.In a show of support, Team India player Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) to be with Mandhana during this challenging time.The postponement comes just weeks after India's victory in the Women's World Cup , where Mandhana played a crucial role in the team's success.Palash's mother, Amita, remains optimistic about the wedding taking place in the near future.""Smriti and Palash dono takleef mein hain...

What improvement looks like - small, visible acts

A new civic movement is needed



NEW DELHI: Across India, behaviours such as littering, spitting, flouting queues, honking needlessly, encroaching on public spaces, and damaging shared property have become so routine that they often pass without notice.They are not merely behavioural glitches; they are embedded, inherited patterns. The problem is not just policy, enforcement, or infrastructure. It is about mindsets passed quietly from one generation to the next, shaping how we view shared spaces and each other.These visuals are perhaps the way of life for many Indians: a man flinging garbage from his car window; a commuter spitting paan from a moving train; a woman stealing blankets from railway compartments; adults teaching children to urinate on roadsides even when public toilets are nearby.The story of an unruly passenger urinating on a co-passenger aboard an Air India flight shocked the nation. But is it really shocking in a country where public walls are routinely marked with fresh stains of neglect?As Kanchan Yadav puts it, ""Just the other day I wanted to stop a man and ask him to show some basic civic sense instead of casually peeing in the open. But somehow, in this country, people seem far more offended by kissing in public than by pissing in public.Whether you're at a bus stand, outside a shop, or just walking past any public space, the most uncomfortable sight is men relieving themselves anywhere they want. They turn entire corners mushy, filthy and unbearable, assaulting your olfactory like a crime scene. """"We keep calling our country motherland and talk so proudly about Mother Nature, but do we really have the civic sense to keep this 'mother' clean and safe?"" she added.We as a society lack basic civic sense. Why? Is it poor education? Weak enforcement? Overpopulation? A scarcity mindset? Or simply a general belief that public spaces are 'not our problem?'The answer, like the problem, is layered.Much of our public discourse around India’s livability focuses on government action: policy, policing, infrastructure, budgets. But a nation’s quality of life is equally, if not more, defined by its people.Ayush Pandey reflected these sentiments as he narrated an incident from his childhood. ""What I vividly remember from my childhood is travelling in general compartments of trains. Back then, as a four or five-year-old, my mother would sometimes make me urinate out of the train window. At that age, I obviously did not understand the difference between relieving myself in public and using a proper washroom — I only remember it as something done for convenience during travel,"" he said.""As I grew old enough to understand the idea of private versus public spaces, I don’t remember doing it again. Until a certain age, this responsibility lies completely with parents, and I believe many children have experienced similar moments on highways or at railway stations,"" Pandey added.While he admitted that most civic issues emerge from poor infrastructure, Ayush added that many cases are mere examples of laziness. He said, ""Civic sense is not just something expected from adults — it is basic courtesy and awareness. Still, we often see grown men urinating in public without hesitation, as if it is their right instead of walking to the nearest restroom. According to me, many Indians have developed a habit: if they can avoid walking even 200–300 steps, or if a washroom is not easily accessible, they simply look left and right — and relieve themselves in the open. ""A city with spotless streets and smooth traffic can be ruined in days if citizens refuse to cooperate. And yet, even a modest city can become pleasant if its people practice discipline and collective responsibility.Consider this: In just the first three months of this year, the Eastern Railway collected over Rs 32 lakh in fines from people spitting across railway stations in Kolkata. And this is just one zone of one railway system in one part of the country. Imagine the true nationwide scale.Or take another recurring story: passengers stealing railway blankets, pillows, taps, mugs and even fans. These are not acts of poverty-driven desperation. Often, they are simply opportunistic and shameless—small acts that collectively damage India’s reputation and weaken public services.Then there are examples from the other side—moments that feel like a slap of irony. In Gurugram, a group of foreign nationals recently organized a cleanliness drive, clearing roads and drains and urging residents to keep the surroundings outside their homes and shops clean.The sight of foreigners cleaning Indian streets while locals walk by unfazed speaks volumes about our civic apathy.These examples do not mean Indians are inherently careless. Rather, they show what happens when generations grow up without structured civic education, without consistent enforcement, and without cultural emphasis on responsibility for shared spaces.In 1982, Wilson and Kelling proposed the now famous Broken Windows Theory: if a broken window is left unrepaired, it signals that more damage will not cost anything. Disorder invites more disorder.India’s streets are a perfect case study. A clean street invites caution. A dirty street becomes a public dustbin. The moment someone sees a pile of garbage on the curb, the brain goes 'Arre yahan sab phenk rahe hain—main bhi dal deta hoon.'Children observe this too. When they see adults casually littering, they internalise it as 'normal behaviour.' With time, this turns into a collective moral numbness: If the environment is already dirty, what difference will my one wrapper make?This is how individual choices compound into national outcomes.Environmentalist Vimlendu Jha believes the problem lies both at policy and individual level. ""It is a behavioural problem when someone says 'chalta hai' while throwing a wrapper outside their car but the same individual won't do so abroad. Forget America, you will not find litter even in Delhi metro. But you will find the railway station across that metro station dirty, the adjoining streets and markets dirty.""""If littering is naturally coming to me, why is this behavior not showing when I take the metro? Why is the New Delhi Metro Station cleaner than New Delhi Railway station? This talks volumes of both the norms and the laws that are being followed,"" said Jha. ""I don't believe littering is part of our DNA as Indians. We are not dirty by design. We work on convenience, we believe in taking shortcuts when no one is watching and the same Indian behaves differently in another country. ""Generations of Indians have lived in an environment where resources—jobs, seats, houses, promotions, rations—were limited. This created a deeply rooted scarcity mindset: If you don’t rush, push, grab, or seize, someone else will take your seat.This mindset spills into daily behaviour:- pushing into trains before passengers have exited- jostling for space in queues- rushing into elevators without letting people out- honking aggressively- breaking traffic rules, overspeedingEven among the affluent, this scarcity attitude persists. It is not about poverty; it is about conditioning.The result is a society where individual urgency trumps collective order, where personal convenience often matters more than mutual respect.Another major factor is the disconnect between rules and consequences.In India, rules are often seen as suggestions, not obligations. Why? Because breaking them rarely brings consequences.People see influential individuals—politicians, celebrities, senior bureaucrats—violating rules with impunity: driving on the wrong side of the road, avoiding fines, intimidating enforcement authorities, or using privilege to bypass regulations.This teaches the public two dangerous lessons:- Rules apply only to the powerless.-Breaking rules is fine as long as you don’t get caught.Children absorb this quickly. They see their parents bragging about how they avoided a(fine), or how a(hack) helped them bypass a procedure. They learn that bending rules is not just acceptable—it is admired.Thus, a culture develops where accountability is weak, and civic sense becomes optional rather than essential.A fundamental misconception in India is that public spaces belong to the government, not the people.'This is not my property' becomes 'I don’t need to take care of it.'So we litter on beaches, damage train seats, spit on walls, break public taps, vandalise monuments, scribble names on heritage structures—all because we subconsciously feel these spaces belong to nobody (or “the government”), and therefore to everyone in a way that excuses neglect.In Scandinavian countries, Japan, or Singapore, public spaces are treated as collective property—extensions of one’s home. In India, public spaces are treated as expendable.Even the most civic-minded citizen struggles in an environment where infrastructure is inadequate:- garbage bins are scarce- footpaths are encroached- public toilets are dirty- traffic systems are chaotic- drainage systems fail in monsoonsAnother difficult truth: civic sense is tied to how we treat people we consider 'lesser.'Many Indians behave respectfully in five-star hotels, airports, or foreign countries—but act very differently in markets, bus stations, and public offices. Why? Because we treat certain spaces, and certain people, as 'inferior,' not worth respecting.The presence of hierarchies—class, caste, gender—distorts our public behaviour:- yelling at sanitation workers, domestic helpers- ignoring queues when domestic helpers are standing in them- bargaining with vegetable-sellers, autorickshaw drivers- honking at pedestrians as if they are obstaclesWithout equality, civic sense withers.For decades, civic education in India has been treated as a formality — light textbook chapters, boring diagrams, no real-world application. Schools focus on exams, not on building socially responsible citizens. Parents often prioritise grades, not behaviour in public spaces. And children learn most strongly not from books, but from what they see adults do.When a child sees a parent throw garbage on the street, it becomes normal. When a child watches elders jump queues, bribe officials, break traffic rules, talk down to domestic workers, or misuse public property, it creates a blueprint for adulthood.""Environment education should not be treated as a subject to score marks. It is a lifestyle choice at the end of the day with clear implications on our lives and culture. We really need to enforce that value system. Environment education paradigm has to shift from just mere knowledge which is information based vs value and action based,"" said Jha.And these habits persist because public behaviour is contagious. Which brings us to the first root cause.India eradicated diseases like Polio through mass awareness and coordinated action. Civic behaviour can be transformed the same way—with a structured, nation-wide effort involving schools, parents, media, and community institutions.And the most crucial piece of this change is children.Children are still forming values. They observe, absorb, and imitate. If given the right guidance, they can reshape the cultural norms that adults have broken.Schools must treat civic sense not as a textbook chapter but as a core part of learning:- daily cleanliness rituals- community outreach programs- traffic rule workshops- waste segregation practices- field visits to understand sanitation and water management- compulsory social responsibility modulesParents must lead by example:- no littering- following queues- treating workers with dignity- obeying traffic rules- stop flexing 'jugaads' in front of childrenChildren learn civic sense from what they see, not what they are told.Advertisements, influencers, films, and social media campaigns can normalise good behaviour the way they normalise trends. Positive peer pressure works better than moral lectures.When civic sense improves, it won’t happen in grand gestures. It will happen in:- a driver stopping before a zebra crossing- a child refusing to litter- a shopkeeper keeping his storefront clean- neighbours cooperating in waste segregation- a commuter asking another not to spit- a tourist complimenting Indians over discipline- a railway coach that remains clean after a long journeyCivic sense is not theoretical. It’s practical, everyday discipline that builds a collective culture.Today, India stands as one of the largest economies and one of the most influential global powers. Yet, the basics— public cleanliness, traffic discipline, respect for common spaces — lag far behind.If we want to become a truly developed society, civic sense must be reimagined as a moral responsibility, a cultural value, a national priority and a daily habit.We have the ingenuity, the youth power, the technological tools, and the community strength to transform our civic culture. What we need is intention.The responsibility lies with all of usIndia’s lack of civic sense is not an unchangeable flaw. It is the result of years of neglect, inconsistent education, overcrowded cities, poor enforcement, and inherited habits. But every habit can be unlearned. Every culture can evolve. Every generation can do better than the last.Just as we took pride in eradicating Polio, we can take pride in building a cleaner, more respectful, more disciplined India.The responsibility lies with all of us—parents, teachers, leaders, citizens—and especially the children who will inherit this country. Because at the end of the day, a nation is not made great by its government. It is made great by its people.","Across India, behaviours such as littering, spitting, flouting queues, honking needlessly, encroaching on public spaces have become so routine that they often pass without notice. The problem is not just policy, enforcement, or infrastructure, but mindsets passed quietly from one generation to the next.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125672919,imgsize-970783,width-400,resizemode-4/november-30.jpg"
"EC extends SIR deadline by a week, it's Dec 11 now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-extends-sir-deadline-by-a-week-its-dec-11-now/articleshow/125680631.cms,"Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

Next polls due only in April-May, EC can stretch SIR by a week

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Sunday extended the timeline for SIR Phase 2 across all 12 states and Union territories, allowing an additional week to booth level officers (BLOs) to share the list of absent, shifted, dead and duplicate electors with booth level agents (BLAs) of political parties prior to publication of the draft electoral roll, so as to ensure full transparency.The enumeration period will now continue till Dec 11 instead of the earlier Dec 4. The draft electoral roll will be published on Dec 16 instead of Dec 9. Claims and objections can be submitted until Jan 15, 2026, and final roll will be out on Feb 14 (Feb 7 earlier).The stretching of all legs of SIR comes amid reports of alleged malpractices in states. Instances include submission of enumeration forms by ineligible persons or illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the name of dead electors, and login credentials of dead BLOs being misused to upload EFs signed in the name of dead electors.Even though these cases may be limited, there is a view that sharing the list of absent, permanently shifted, dead and duplicate entries with the parties through their BLAs even before the draft rolls are published will allow rival parties an opportunity to object to any incorrect findings. They can also point out attempts to sneak in ineligible persons into the draft roll through impersonation of dead voters.An official said since the next round of assembly polls in five states/UT, including West Bengal, is due only in April-May 2026, the poll authority has time to stretch SIR by a week if it helps ensure a perfect electoral roll.Any errors or anomalies can be corrected in advance, minimising doubts, apprehensions and complaints after the draft rolls are published, the official underlined.Incidentally, the extension in SIR timeline comes even as the enumeration exercise is well on track, with EFs of 84.3% electors across 12 states/UTs collected by far. The EF collection stands at 100% in Lakshadweep, 96.6% in Goa, 95.6% in Rajasthan, 95.2% in West Bengal, 92.7% in Madhya Pradesh, 92.1% in Puducherry, 88.7% in Chhattisgarh, 87.6% in Tamil Nadu, 86% in Gujarat, 83.6% in Andaman & Nicobar, 81.2% in Kerala and 69.5% in UP. EC officials said the progress of work in all five states/UT due for polls in mid-2026, including West Bengal, is satisfactory.As regards UP, they underlined that assembly poll is due there only in mid-2027, giving EC ample scope to extend the timeline further specifically for the state.","Next polls due only in April-May, EC can stretch SIR by a week if it helps ensure a perfect electoral roll.

‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Saturday unanimously elected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as the opposition coalition’s leader in the Bihar assembly, a decision taken at the alliance's first meeting since its drubbing in the recent state polls.The meeting was convened by Yadav ahead of the five-day assembly session beginning Monday.RJD MLA Bhai Virendra told reporters, “Tejashwi Yadav has been elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state legislature. Naturally, he will also lead our party in the assembly.”Congress MLC Samir Kumar Singh, a working president of the grand old party’s state unit, noted that the choice was unanimous. “We have sufficient numbers, and he (Tejashwi) will also be the Leader of the Opposition,” he remarked.The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats. The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”","The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his monthly radio pogramme Mann Ki Baat , on Sunday said the month of November has ""brought a lot of aspirations"" and recalled the major events of which the nation witnessed in the 11th month of the 2025.""India has taken a major step in maintenance, repair, and overhaul in the aviation sector. Last week, INS Mahe was inducted into the Indian Navy in Mumbai. Last week, India's space ecosystem got a new boost with Skyroot's Infinity Campus. All this has become a reflection of Bharat's new ideas, innovation, and youth power.""Addressing the nation during the 128th episode of the Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi lauded a team of young people from Pune, who attempted to fly drones in Mars-like conditions.He said, ""A few days ago, a video on social media caught my attention. It was about a unique drone competition organised by ISRO. In this video, our country's youth, especially our Gen-Z, were attempting to fly drones in Martian-like conditions. In this competition, a team of young people from Pune achieved some success. Their drone even fell and crashed several times, but they did not give up. After several attempts, this team's drone managed to fly for some time in the conditions of Mars.He added that the video reminded him of the setback when Chandrayaan went out of network coverage. Further, the Prime Minister added that the setback was followed by the success of Chandrayaan-3.""This video reminded me of the day Chandrayaan went out of network coverage. That day, the entire country, especially the scientists, was demoralised. But this setback did not deter them. On that very day, they started writing the success story of Chandrayaan-3. The determination of our youth is the greatest strength of Viksit Bharat,"" he said.In 2019, ISRO lost communication with the Vikram lander during the Chandrayaan-2 mission.Mann Ki Baat has served as one of the Prime Minister’s key platforms for connecting with citizens both within India and abroad. PM Modi shares his thoughts on a range of national issues, highlights grassroots initiatives, and encourages public participation in developmental and social campaigns, an approach that has become a hallmark of the programme.The previous episode, aired on October 26, marked the 127th edition of the broadcast. During that address, the Prime Minister extended greetings on the occasion of Chhath Parv and applauded young creators contributing to the revival of Sanskrit. He also celebrated India’s coffee sector gaining greater global recognition.Touching upon public welfare efforts, PM Modi had spoken about the ‘GST Bachat Utsav’, noting the widespread enthusiasm it generated.He highlighted several citizen-driven initiatives promoting cleanliness and sustainability, including the ‘Garbage Café’ in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh, where meals are offered in exchange for plastic waste, as well as a Bengaluru campaign led by engineer Kapil Sharma to rejuvenate the city’s lakes.The Prime Minister also praised the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for increasing the presence of Indian-breed dogs in their units, underscoring the country’s growing emphasis on indigenous capabilities.Over the years, Mann Ki Baat has evolved into a significant platform for showcasing inspiring grassroots efforts and promoting civic engagement.Since its launch in October 2014, the programme has played a notable role in raising awareness on issues such as cleanliness, environmental conservation, digital literacy, and women’s empowerment, often catalysing widespread participation and people-driven movements.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the month of November has ""brought a lot of aspirations"" He recalled the major events of which the nation witnessed in the 11th month of the 2025.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

NEW DELHI: In just under three months, you will not be able to maintain your desktop/computer login on communication apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Snapchat for more than six hours at a stretch. You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider. Also, if you try to log into your communication apps on smartphones without the SIM card on which you first downloaded the app, it will not connect.This follows new orders issued by govt that say that communication apps should not allow connections on smartphones where the SIM card on which the user was originally identified is missing. The move is being taken to counter cyber fraud. Companies have to comply or face penalties. ""Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 , the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws,"" govt said.The department of telecom said the current set-up was being misused by cyber fraudsters. ""... it has come to the notice of central govt that some of the app-based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services, allows users to consume their services without availability of the underlying Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) within the device in which app-based communication services is running,"" the department of telecom said, adding that the feature was posing a challenge to telecom cyber security ""as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds"".DoT said it had become necessary to issue the directions to prevent the misuse of telecommunication identifiers and to safeguard the integrity and security of the telecom ecosystem.DoT issued the orders on Nov 21. ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure that the app-based communication services are continuously linked to the SIM card (associated with mobile number used for identification of customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services) installed in the device, making it impossible to use the app without that specific, active SIM,"" it said.On the web service on computers, it said, ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure the web service instance of the mobile app, if provided, shall be logged out periodically (not later than 6 hours) and allow the facility to the user to re-link the device using QR code.""It asked the companies to submit compliance reports within 120 days from the issue of the directions.","You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider.

‘Full Stop to Many Questions’ Chirag Paswan Hails PM Modi, Nitish as NDA Soars Past 200 Seats

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan — whose party is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that swept the recent Bihar assembly polls — on Sunday claimed that “several MLAs” from the opposition Mahagathbandhan are in touch with the ruling camp.Paswan made the remark while responding to questions from journalists about speculation that at least four newly elected Congress MLAs — the party won only six seats — are in touch with the Janata Dal (United), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar.“I cannot say about any specific party but many opposition MLAs are in touch with the NDA. They feel that it is only in this coalition, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , that they can serve the people,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The Hajipur MP argued that there is “growing disenchantment” with the opposition, which he accused of doing “nothing constructive” and of ""obstructing"" the government’s functioning.“This has been noticed during every session of the Parliament. We anticipate similar behaviour in the session beginning tomorrow when, incidentally, the session of the state assembly is also going to commence,” Paswan, a former actor, remarked.The winter session of Parliament and a special five-day session of the Bihar assembly — the first since the elections — will begin on Monday. The Parliament session will conclude on December 19.However, Bihar Congress president Rajesh Ram — who himself lost in the recent polls — bristled at the LJP (RV) chief claim.“This has been a narrative that always does the rounds whenever elections are held. We heard similar things in 2020, but all our 19 MLAs remained with the party,” Ram stated.The NDA secured 202 of the assembly’s 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, followed by ally JD(U) with 85. The LJP (RV) recorded its best-ever performance, winning 19 of the 28 seats it contested, with two of its MLAs inducted as ministers. Alliance partners Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha bagged five and four seats, respectively.In contrast, the Mahagathbandhan managed only 35 seats, of which 25 came from its biggest constituent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal.","Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan claimed that ""several MLAs"" from the opposition Mahagathbandhan are in touch with the ruling camp.

Airbus A320 Glitch: Ex-IAF Pilot Shows How ELAC 2 Fails In Real-Time Flight Simulation

NEW DELHI: Software rolled back, solar-storm threat neutralised. Indian operators of Airbus A320 jets - IndiGo Air India and Air India Express - finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day, heading off widespread groundings feared after the manufacturer raised red flags late Friday.DGCA was informed early Sunday that 323 aircraft had received the required ""downgrade"" to an earlier edition of the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC). Airbus had found that a later software upgrade could trigger sudden loss of control during intense solar storms - a failure linked to a US carrier's A320 that plunged abruptly on Oct 30, injuring 15 passengers.IndiGo completed the task across all 200 affected aircraft. Air India carried out the fix on 100 - nine jets were later assessed as not needing the rollback and four were already in base maintenance. AI Express finished updates on 23 of 25, with two under redelivery maintenance.Carriers escaped major disruption - only single-digit cancellations and delays of up to 90 minutes - thanks to IndiGo's young A320 fleet and the AI Group's limited number of older airframes. Older aircraft require hardware modifications alongside the software rollback, expanding task time.Globally, fallout was heavier. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for the turmoil but insisted urgency was essential. ""The fix required on some A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays... But we consider that nothing is more important than safety,"" he wrote on X, adding that Airbus teams were working ""around the clock"" to help airlines get aircraft flying again.",IndiGo Air India and Air India Express finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day.

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister’s Omar Abdullah ’s National Conference (NC) has foregrounded a recently adopted resolution for restoration of special status, seeking to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to BJP.Spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar stressed the resolution, passed on Nov 28 at NC’s working committee -- its highest decision-making body --was a message to all that the party’s ideological position remains unchanged.“In the working committee meeting, party legislators stressed that we must not be seen as giving up on our political agenda of restoring the special status under Article 370 . The resolution reaffirms our commitment to special status. It reflects the dominant sentiment within the party,” Dar told TOI.The resolution states that “the working committee unanimously reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the restoration of J&K’s special status”, adding the issue is central to aspirations and dignity of the people and must be addressed without further delay. “The party will continue its principled fight for its full restoration.”NC also urged the Centre to immediately restore full statehood to J&K, as “promised on the floor of Parliament, repeatedly affirmed in public domain, and noted by Supreme Court”.NC’s manifesto for the 2024 polls had vowed to strive for restoration of “Article 370 and statehood as prior to Aug 5, 2019” -- when the Centre abrogated the special status and turned J&K into a Union territory.On Nov 6 last year, weeks after NC was voted to office, J&K assembly passed a resolution seeking special status. Later, NC was accused by one of its own MPs, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, and opposition PDP of giving up on Article 370 and concentrating on “restoration of statehood”.Dar said several legislators in the working committee meeting pushed for protests in Delhi to press for statehood, citing difficulties they face at the ground level in getting developmental work executed. But the leadership decided to wait at this stage. “The party expects the Centre to restore statehood as promised in Supreme Court and Parliament,” Dar said.Another NC functionary, Salman Sagar, underscored concerns about attempts to link the party with BJP and the need to counter such narratives firmly.“Central govt and BJP are two different things. As a border state, maintaining a working and cordial relationship with Centre is necessary. But that does not mean we are aligned with BJP. CM (Omar) has made it clear we will never partner with BJP. He reiterated this in the working committee meeting, too. We have decided to challenge any narrative that seeks to portray NC as BJP-friendly. We will fight this narrative war,” Sagar said.","National Conference (NC) seeks to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to BJP.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

NEW DELHI: At least one in every five car users on tolled National Highway stretches is now using FASTag Annual Pass to pay the user fee. With an active user base of 36.3 lakh and around 20,000 new buyers being added daily, the scheme has become a runaway success in just three and a half months since its launch, data show.The FASTag Annual Pass, priced at Rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year, effectively bringing down the fee to just Rs 15 per plaza. It has emerged as the most convenient and cost-friendly payment option for inter-city commuters. Data from more than a dozen toll plazas show that over 40% of car users are paying the user fee through the annual pass.“At the national level, nearly 22% of toll transactions for cars are done using the annual pass. The newly operational Bijwasan toll plaza on the Dwarka Expressway in Delhi has the highest share, with more than 50% of such transactions. It is followed by the Mundka toll plaza in Delhi (48.2%) and the Jhinjholi plaza in Sonipat, Haryana, where the share is over 47%,” said a senior NHAI official.Data further show that on average around 13 lakh toll payment transactions occur through the annual pass each day.Officials said initial feedback from toll operators and commuters indicates that there have been hardly any instances of altercation or violence over the new system between commuters and user-fee collectors at plazas. They added that the increased adoption of the system has also significantly reduced queues at toll gates. “It has improved the operational efficiency of toll operators. We will soon carry out a comprehensive impact assessment of the scheme,” said a top official of IHMCL, a subsidiary of NHAI.","The FASTag Annual Pass, priced at Rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year.

India’s Maritime Future Is Preordained: CDS Chauhan Predicts Indian Navy’s Decisive Warfighting Role

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Sunday said he would not call Bangladesh “anything other than a friend” and expressed confidence that “things would turn around” for India’s eastern neighbour after its parliamentary elections in February 2026.India–Bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, 2024. Hasina, who resigned after months of student-led protests, has been living in Delhi since her ouster.“I would still refrain from calling Bangladesh anything other than a friend — because this could be a temporary and transitory moment. We’ll have to wait; elections have to happen, and then something else can happen,” Admiral Tripathi said in Pune, where he attended the passing-out parade of cadets at the National Defence Academy (NDA).He added that he met Bangladeshi cadets — the NDA also trains cadets from friendly foreign countries — ahead of the parade, and recalled that his first visit after taking over as Navy chief was to Bangladesh.“I was supposed to go to some ‘fancy’ capital but I said, ‘No. I must first go to Bangladesh.’ Tremendous warmth, tremendous hospitality...tremendous nostalgia about what India did,” he remarked, referring possibly to the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the creation of Bangladesh.“I'm an eternal optimist and I hope that things would turn around as far as Bangladesh is concerned,” Admiral Tripathi remarked.The neighbouring nation is currently governed by a caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which assumed charge days after Hasina’s exit.Hasina was recently sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity” linked to the student protest movement. Dhaka has repeatedly sought her extradition, while New Delhi maintains that the request remains under “consideration.”","India–Bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, 2024.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has pulled up the West Bengal government for not releasing the increased honorarium for booth level officers (BLOs) and the additional payment approved for the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.In a statement, the poll body said it had informed an All India Trinamool Congress delegation during a November 28 meeting that the delay in payments was “very strange”.“We told the AITC delegation… that it is very strange that the increased honorarium of Rs 12,000 per year for BLOs and an additional Rs 6,000 to BLOs for SIRs approved by the ECI has not yet been paid by the state government.

It also approved an honorarium for electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).The Commission said the revision was meant to acknowledge the crucial work of field teams engaged in preparing clean and transparent voter lists.""Pure electoral rolls are the bedrock of democracy.

Opposition flags Delhi blast, SIR, air pollution and farmers’ concerns

Government ready to hear Opposition, stresses rules and procedure

Bills listed for the Winter Session

NEW DELHI: An all-party meeting was held on Sunday ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament . The Opposition demanded detailed discussions during the session and raised concerns over the government’s handling of key national matters.The Opposition sought debates on national security in the wake of the recent Delhi blast, the “SIR” issue, rising air pollution, farmers’ concerns, safeguarding democracy and foreign policy developments.The meeting was chaired by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju . Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arjun Ram Meghwal and JP Nadda were also present.On the Opposition side, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh, TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav and AIADMK’s M Thambi Durai were among those attending.Kalyan Banerjee criticized the government for not allowing certain issues raised by the Opposition to be discussed. He highlighted key concerns such as SIR and MGNREGA and questioned the role of the Opposition if parliamentary debate is restricted.Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said the party raised these issues at the meeting and insisted that Parliament must debate them.“It seems the government, under the leadership of the prime minister and the home minister, is looking to finish off India’s democracy and parliamentary traditions,” he said.Gogoi added that the Opposition wanted a discussion on national security, especially after the Delhi blast, and on “ensuring the purity of the voter list”. He also flagged economic security, saying farmers were still not receiving fair prices.On foreign policy, Gogoi said, “India is formulating its foreign policy on the basis of other countries. Someone does not like us buying oil from Russia. Another country is investing in its defence and we are not ready.”Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav warned that his party would not allow the House to function if a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is not held.“We will not allow the House to function if discussion is not held on SIR. The Samajwadi Party has raised the issue of SIR because on a large scale, I have seen irregularities. First, we used to hear but now we are seeing that people's votes are being cut. In Bihar, there have been malpractices. We have demanded a discussion on it (SIR). They cannot shy away from it by citing the Election Commission,” he said.On the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, Congress MP Pramod Tiwari also highlighted several issues the Opposition intends to raise.He also pointed to the schedule of parliamentary business and strategic meetings planned by the Opposition.“The SIR was conducted across the entire state in a very short span of time, which is impossible... Blasts have occurred in the capital. Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policies are completely lost. In addition, air pollution in Delhi and other states must be discussed in detail. We have a strategic meeting today at 6 pm, and the Business Advisory Committee meeting is happening at 4 pm. Let us see what is on the BJP’s agenda,” Tiwari said.DMK MP Tiruchi Siva said that all Opposition parties were unanimous in demanding discussion on the “SIR” issue during the session.CPI-M MP John Brittas said, “Delhi blast exposed govt; we want discussion on security issues.” He added that if Parliament faces disruptions, “it is full responsibility of government.”After the all-party meeting, Rijiju addressed concerns about the functioning of Parliament and the conduct of members during the Winter Session. He emphasized that the government was open to discussions and intended to ensure that all issues are debated within parliamentary rules.“No one said that the Parliament will not function or will not let it function. Some leaders said that they can create a ruckus in the House over SIR. I am saying this in a positive manner that we are ready to listen to the opposition...Parliament belongs to everyone; it belongs to the country. There is a method to discuss every issue in the Parliament. There are rules, there are conventions,” Rijiju said.The Winter Session will run from December 1 to 19 and include 15 sittings. Parliament is expected to take up major legislative and financial business.The Health Security and National Security Cess Bill, 2025 is likely to be introduced to impose a new cess aimed at improving the country’s health infrastructure and national security preparedness. The President has recommended its introduction under provisions applicable to Money Bills.The Manipur GST (Second Amendment) Bill, 2025 seeks to improve tax administration in the state, while the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 proposes changes to modernise excise regulations on goods and industries.Other important proposals include amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Corporate Laws, National Highways Act and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, as well as the Higher Education Commission of India Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline higher education regulation.Maritime sector reforms including merchant shipping and port-related bills, are also expected to strengthen compliance with global standards.Parliament will also take up the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2025-26 and the related Appropriation Bill. Private Members’ Bills are scheduled on December 5 and 19, with resolutions on December 12.","The Opposition sought debates on national security in the wake of the recent Delhi blast, the “SIR” issue, rising air pollution, farmers’ concerns, safeguarding democracy and foreign policy developments.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.","The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

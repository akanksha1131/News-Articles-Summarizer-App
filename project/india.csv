’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

NEW DELHI: CPI(Maoist) central committee (CC) member in charge of the banned outfit’s Odisha state committee, Ganesh Uike, has criticised his CC colleague Chandranna over his recent surrender before the Telangana police, and claimed that efforts to take the “Naxal movement” forward will continue notwithstanding the reverses over the last two years.Uike also disowned Chandranna’s claim that politburo member Devji had been chosen to succeed Basavraj as CPI(Maoist) general secretary. “This is a white lie since the central committee has not met even since general secretary Basavraj was neutralised. With the Central on an offensive against us, the conditions are still not conducive to hold a CC meeting,” Uike said in a statement issued on behalf of the CPI(Maoist) Odisha state committee.Stating that the “protracted people’s war” has encountered many hardships, including the current impasse, Uike claimed the party was trying to contain its losses and move forward. “The ‘party’ will continue to take the Naxal movement forward,” he stated.Chhattisgarh police officials, who are still verifying the authenticity of the Odisha state committee’s statement, said that if true, it concedes defeat and highlights the growing frustration and deep crisis/chasm within the Maoist ranks.“After the recent surrender of politburo member Sonu and CC members Rupesh and Chandranna, the Maoist leadership is shaken. To save face, it is resorting to falsehoods and hollow rhetoric about ‘continuing the revolution’. These empty words can no longer disguise the truth — that the outfit is in complete disarray, morally bankrupt and strategically cornered across all affected states,” Bastar range IGP P Sunderraj told TOI.“The Maoist leadership’s attempt to brand committed cadres who chose peace as ‘traitors’ only reveals their insecurity and helplessness. The latest statement, if authentic, exposes that Devji no longer enjoys authority even within the fragmented and weakened Maoist outfit,” he added."," CPI(Maoist) central committee (CC) member in charge of the banned outfit’s Odisha state committee, Ganesh Uike, has criticised his CC colleague Chandranna over his recent surrender before the Telangana police. “The ‘party’ will continue to take the Naxal movement forward,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124982403,imgsize-445550,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday ordered the termination of two J&K government teachers found by an internal enquiry to be part of Lashker e Taiba's (LeT) overground network in Jammu division's Reasi and Rajouri districts respectively.The two staffers -- Ghulam Hussain, who joined the J&K education department in 2004 and Majid Iqbal Dar, working there since 2009 -- were dismissed by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as part of the ongoing, broader crackdown on the terror ecosystem within the Union territory. Nearly 77 J&K govt staffers have been given marching orders under this provision since 2020.Both Hussain and Dar are currently lodged in prison in separate terror cases.Sources in J&K govt told TOI that Hussain was posted at Govt Primary School, Kalwa, Mahore, Reasi but covertly working for LeT to strengthen its terror network in Reasi and the surrounding areas.“The evidence collected by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies has revealed that he was in touch with LeT terrorists Mohd Qasim and Ghulam Mustafa through encrypted messaging applications and was carrying out terror activities at their behest.He would receive terror funds via local conduits and pass them on to families of known terrorists for support, besides using the money for terror recruitment and logistics.Ghulam was arrested in 2023. Sources, citing investigation details, said he was a highly-radicalised terror sympathiser and involved in recruitment of youth into the terror fold.Majid Iqbal Dar was appointed as a laboratory assistant in 2009 promoted as a teacher in 2019. As per the dossier on his terror links, Dar was working for LeT as an OGW and was involved in radicalising youngsters in Rajouri and surrounding areas. Investigation revealed that Dar was engaged in narco-terror activities and maintained a close link with LeT terrorist Mod Jabar. He was a reliable asset to LeT and was using drug money to finance terror activities and radicalise gullible youth, said a source.“Dar’s terror link was exposed in January 2023 when police recovered an IED planted near J&K Bank in Rajouri. During the course of investigation, the police arrested three persons including Dar. It was later revealed that Majid, along with LeT terrorists Jabar and Zohaib Shazad, had planted the IED on the instruction of an LeT handler based in Pakistan. They had received monetary compensation via a conduit,” said an officer.Sources said Dar continues to display radical tendencies inside the prison.","Ghulam Hussain, who joined the J&K education department in 2004, and Majid Iqbal Dar, working there since 2009, were dismissed.

PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress Over Rahul Gandhi's Chhath 'Nautanki' Remark, Calls Out Jungle Raj

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"".

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel didn’t just integrate India. He also helped construct the nation’s democratic institutions...This is the crown jewel of his glittering career. Just after attaining independence from colonial rule in 1947, India was confronted with a major challenge. About 40% of the country was under 565 princely states. Integrating them seamlessly into the fabric of a newly born nation was a masterly act of persuasion. There were some, such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, who held out. That’s when Vallabhbhai Patel, then India’s deputy prime minister and home minister, showed his iron fists. Operation Polo followed, forcing the recalcitrant Nizam to sign “the instrument of accession”. Partition had claimed at least 200,000 lives. Due to Patel’s resolute blend of diplomacy and force, one of the most demanding obstacles to a fully unified India was countered with minimum human cost. Hence, he justifiably became “the Iron Man of India.”The birth of civil services dates back to the early years of British rule. It was “the steel frame” of colonial rule. Which is why many were sceptical about its continuance in free India.Even before Independence, as home minister of the interim govt, Patel had been engaged with the issue of the future of the civil and police services. To that end, he had convened a conference of provincial premiers in Oct 1946. Post Independence, he held the firm view that an all-India merit-based administrative service was fundamental to hold Indians together. His efforts were key to the formation of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) as a replacement to ICS. This was a new steel frame for a newly independent nation. He is said to have told young officers to serve the people with integrity and humility.Patel also outlined the purpose of the census and mapped its vision. In Feb 1950, just 10 months before his death, Patel inaugurated a conference of census superintendents in Delhi. In the conference, the deputy PM underlined that the census will play a vital role in determining India’s administrative policies. “Census, he stated, was no longer a mere counting of heads but involved the extraction of valuable scientific data of sociological importance,” a report published insaid. He further elaborated on the outline of the exercise: “…the present census would devote greater attention to the collection and formulation of basic economic data relating to the means of livelihood of the people and other economic activities of the individual…” Patel further said, “I would like to stress Census affords an opportunity for the Government to reach every home throughout the length and breadth of the country. ” Simply put, Patel put together the building blocks of the first census, which began in 1951.If Champaran Satyagraha brought Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to national prominence, the Bardoli Satyagraha did the same for Patel. Like Champaran, Bardoli was a farmers’ protest against imposition of high taxes. Patel’s methodical and disciplined organisation of a mass movement, which led to a cancellation of the tax raise, earned him the endearing sobriquet of Sardar, by which he was referred to by many for the rest of his life. Much before the Bardoli Satyagraha (1928), though, Patel had provided a glimpse of his abilities while assisting Gandhi in Kheda Satyagraha (1918). This was another battle for peasant rights where Patel showcased his pragmatic leadership style and steadfastness to farmers’ cause.On Jan 17, 1948, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel spoke at Chowpatty in Mumbai. The meeting was attended by at least one lakh people. In an hour-long speech, India’s deputy PM said that if the country was to survive as a nation, it needed a strong army.reported: “Mahatma Gandhi did not believe in armed strength, Sardar Patel added. But as a practical man, he could not accept the Mahatma’s advice so far as the military strength of India was concerned. Our army ought to be strong enough that no power would ever think of interfering in India.”",Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was India’s deputy prime minister and home minister.

'NDA Coming To Power With Thumping Majority': Bihar Minister Sanjay Saraogi On Assembly Polls

PATNA: NDA is all set to release its manifesto for the assembly elections on Friday, focusing on creating jobs within the state in sectors such as IT, semiconductors and micro, small and medium enterprises and setting up a contrast with opposition alliance, Mahagathbandhan's bid to draw voters with the lure of govt jobs.The BJP-led alliance's plan presents a contrasting vision and is seen to be ambitious in a state where there is a clamour for cushy govt jobs. In contrast, private jobs, although better paying are seen as riskier, often linked to business cycles and come with features like remuneration being linked to performance.Besides, in the past govts in Bihar have been seen to be more rigid to accommodating the demands of the private sector when it comes to concessions or providing land. The IT sector and MSMEs do not require large tracts of land.With migration being a major issue, NDA's push for creating employment within the state is also likely to address the concern.""There is talent here so why not focus on IT and similar sectors given that professionals from Bihar are working in Pune, Gurgaon and Bangalore,"" said a prominent NDA politician.The focus on MSMEs is seen to be a more pragmatic commitment given that Bihar is unlikely to be able to attract large factories to be set up without having the ecosystem that can cater to the big manufacturing companies.","The BJP-led alliance's plan presents a contrasting vision and is seen to be ambitious in a state where there is a clamour for cushy govt jobs.

8th Pay Commission: What will be the impact of fitment factor on salary?





Central government employees and pensioners can soon look forward to getting higher salaries and pensions respectively, with the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission being approved by the Cabinet this week.The 8th Central Pay Commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months and the recommendations, once approved by the government, will likely be effective retrospectively from January 1, 2026.According to an ET report, the 7th Pay Commission saw a fitment factor of 2.57 being implemented. The fitment or multiplier factor for the 8th Pay Commission will be known after the commission’s report and government’s approval.Manjeet Singh Patel, who heads the All India NPS Employees Federation as National President, told ET that calculation of new basic pay involves multiplying the existing basic salary with the fitment factor assigned by the latest pay commission.To understand this better: take an example where an individual has a basic pay of Rs 35,000. This when multiplied by a fitment factor of 2.11, results in a new basic salary of Rs 73,850.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know Nexdigm's Director of Payroll Services, Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, said that percentage-based allowances like HRA will increase proportionally with the revised basic pay upon notification.He was quoted as saying that fixed benefits such as transport allowance undergo separate reviews and their revisions typically follow several months after the implementation of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations.Whilst dearness allowance isn't the direct determinant of fitment factor, pay commissions tend to consider the DA rate, which is calculated based on basic pay, as one of the crucial elements whilst establishing the fitment factor.To illustrate, Patel explains that with the current DA at 58% and a projected 12% increase by the time the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations take effect, DA could possibly reach 70%.The government then assesses the growth factor, which previously stood at 24%. The pay commission's calculations also incorporate family units, earlier set at 3 but potentially rising to 4 this time. A shift to 4 family units could result in an additional 13% increase. The fitment factor takes into account all of these things.Patel told ET that whilst the fitment factor influences the basic salary and HRA, the DA resets to zero under a new pay commission. As a result, the overall salary increase for central government employees may typically range between 20-25%.In the context of the 7th Pay Commission, a standard factor of 2.57 was implemented uniformly for all positions, Krishnamoorthy said. Whilst the government might maintain this consistent approach for ease of administration, there exists a possibility of introducing a marginally higher multiplier for lower salary bands to reduce income gaps.Also Read | Husband missing for over 7 years: How wife won a case in Chhattisgarh High Court to get central government pension - ruling explained According to Patel, senior-level staff have increased opportunities for career advancement compared to junior staff. Therefore, the commission could potentially allocate higher fitment factors to lower-ranking staff and lower factors to senior positions. Additionally, consideration might be given to consolidating certain pay levels to streamline the pay structure.Currently, central government employees are classified across 18 distinct pay levels.For a central government employee with basic pay of Rs 50,000, the revised salary calculation under a 2.0 fitment factor is straightforward.Krishnamoorthy says if the fitment factor is fixed at 2, then the employee's current basic pay of Rs 50,000 under the 7th Pay Commission would be multiplied by it.Also Read | Income Tax department doubts Rs 10 lakh gift - brother gets tax notice for cash received from sisters; how he appealed & won the case This calculation results in a new basic pay of Rs 1,00,000. The employee would be positioned at the nearest higher cell in the revised pay matrix. Additional benefits such as DA, HRA and transport allowance would then be computed based on this new basic salary.According to Krishnamoorthy, pension revisions for central government retirees typically follow the same fitment factor. Using the 2.0 factor as an example, a pensioner currently receiving Rs 30,000 would have their basic pension increased to approximately Rs 60,000, pending final approval and adjustments.","The 8th Central Pay Commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months.

2. Exam dates for Classes 10 and 12:

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Education, has released the final schedule for Class 10 and 12 board examinations 2026. The examinations are scheduled to commence from February 17, 2026, with a starting time of 10:30 AM (IST). The tentative schedule was earlier released on September 24, 2025, allowing students and schools to plan their preparation well in advance.This marks the first time CBSE has issued the final date sheet nearly 110 days before the examinations, following the timely submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) by schools. The early release is expected to help students, teachers, and families plan their schedules effectively.While preparing the date sheet, CBSE ensured sufficient gaps between two subjects generally offered by a student. The timetable also accounts for entrance examinations for Class 12 students, allowing them to manage both board and competitive exams efficiently.The evaluation process has been carefully planned so that teachers of all subjects will not be absent from schools simultaneously.Additionally, the date sheet avoids more than 40,000 subject combinations to ensure no two examinations of the same student fall on the same day.The early release of the date sheet allows students to start their preparations well in advance, helping them reduce examination anxiety and improve performance. Families can plan summer vacations around the examination dates and teachers’ schedules.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.",US President Donald Trump hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India.

'Some Indian companies': China OKs supply of rare earth magnets to India; what MEA said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-indian-companies-china-oks-supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-to-india-what-mea-said/articleshow/124974822.cms,"India’s Iran Gambit Pays Off: US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

Mumbai hostage scare: What accused Rohit Arya said in chilling video — his demands & motive revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-hostage-scare-what-accused-rohit-arya-said-in-chilling-video-his-demands-motive-revealed/articleshow/124960555.cms,"What Arya said in the chilling video



The story behind



NEW DELHI: A scary hostage situation unfolded in Mumbai's Powai on Thursday, as 50-year-old Rohit Arya held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio, claiming he only wanted to ""have a conversation"" with certain people. Arya was shot when he allegedly tried to harm the children with an air gun and later died in hospital, officials said.Before the police entered the studio, Arya posted a video that circulated widely online in which he explained why he had taken the children and set out what he called his demands.In the viral clip, Arya introduced himself and explained his plan in calm, measured terms. He began by saying he had chosen hostage-taking over suicide and framed his action as a means to demand answers:""I am Rohit Arya. Instead of (committing) suicide, I made a plan and have taken a few children hostage....I have very simple demands. Very moral, ethical demands. I have some questions. I want to speak to some people and on their answers, if there are any counter-questions, I want to ask them. But I want these answers. I do not want anything else. I am not a terrorist, nor do I have any demand of money. Want to make simple conversations. ""He warned of consequences if provoked and insisted his motive was to force public answers: ""I want simple conversations, and that's why I've taken these children hostage.I've held them hostage as part of a plan. If I live, I'll do it. If I die, someone else will, but it will definitely happen. It will happen to these children if they don't suffer any harm.""He also threatened an extreme response to any ""wrong move"" : ""The slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this whole place on fire and die in it. Whether I die or not, the children will be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised definitely.""Arya denied responsibility for any harm should it occur and framed himself as a person seeking talk-based solutions: ""If something happens to them, I shouldn't be held responsible for it. Those who are unnecessarily triggering me should be held responsible, cause a normal person just wants to talk.""""I am going to provide a solution just by talking. Please don't trigger me to do some harm to anybody,"" he added.According to Mumbai Police , Rohit Arya had called several children including boys and girls around 15 years old to R A Studio in Powai’s Mahavir Classic building for what he claimed was an audition for a web series. The auditions had reportedly been taking place for the past two days.The situation turned grim around 1:30 pm on Thursday, when Powai police received a distress call about a man holding several people hostage inside the studio. A massive response followed — teams from the Quick Response Team (QRT), the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, and the fire brigade immediately rushed to the scene.""At about 1.30 pm, Powai police station received information that a person had taken 17 children hostage at Mahavir Classic building. The Mumbai Police team conducted a rescue operation and safely freed all the children. During the operation, while rescuing the children, the person got injured, was immediately rushed to the hospital and later declared dead,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Datta Nalawade told PTI.Nalawade said the police initially tried to negotiate with Arya but were forced to act when talks failed. ""It was a challenging operation, because we were negotiating with him without any positive outcome. To save the children’s lives was our priority,"" he added.To reach the hostages, the police entered the studio through a bathroom window using a ladder provided by the fire brigade. In the operation, 17 children, a senior citizen, and another man were safely rescued.Officials said Arya was carrying an air gun and some chemicals. While police initially did not confirm that any firing took place during the rescue, Arya was declared dead at 5:15 pm at the hospital.Andheri MLA Murji Patel later visited the rescued children at Seven Hills Hospital. He said, ""I met the children at the hospital they were safe."" As per reports Arya had been shooting with the group for five days and had not appeared to threaten or intimidate them before Thursday’s incident.","Rohit Arya, 50, held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio in Mumbai.

India backs Turkiye rival Cyprus





NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country. Pakistan is faced with similar concerns emanating from India's decision to put in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a Word Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. Pakistan seems to think that it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity.Its neighbors find it unacceptable. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" said the Indian official.Govt rejected OIC’s latest statement on J&K, saying the group had no locus standi to comment on issues internal to India. “Regarding the statement made by the OIC secretariat, we reject those statements. They don’t have any locus standi to speak on matters which are internal to India,” said the MEA spokesperson.The OIC general secretariat had released a statement Monday in which it reiterated “full solidarity with the people of J&K in their legitimate quest for the right to self-determination”.Amidst India’s strained relationship with Turkiye, MEA S Jaishankar reiterated New Delhi’s “unwavering” support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Republic of Cyprus, which does not have diplomatic ties with Ankara, in line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. In a meeting with his visiting counterpart Constantinos Kombos, the minister also appreciated Cyprus’s consistent support on issues of core interest to India, especially in the battle against cross-border terrorism and India’s bid to become a permanent member of the security council.","Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region.

It added that in case a user faces difficulties in uploading documents, the issuing bank will proactively contact customers and assist the users, before disconnection.Officials said customers can also lodge complaints or raise queries on the NH helpline number 1033.

To isolate Tehran, the US state department had in Sept revoked the sanctions exception issued in 2018 for the port that India developed for access to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pak.Once effective, those operating the port or carrying out related activities under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act are likely to face US sanctions.The port is increasingly important for India's access to Afghanistan at a time when its ties with the Taliban regime in Kabul are on the upswing. Both sides are looking to ramp up their economic ties and the Taliban have appealed to Pakistan to allow India and Afghanistan to trade via the land route.",US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months.

'Police's response was measured, safety of those held captive was priority'





MUMBAI: A 45-year-old documentary filmmaker from Pune held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series. The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations and shot him in the chest purportedly in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative's flat in Chembur for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted ""simple answers"" to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him. In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted ""to be heard"". ""Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,"" he said.Police officials said they spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with Aarrya and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls' parents said she suffered from seizures.An official said Rohit Aarrya appeared calm when police spoke to him, but at no stage did he elaborate on his motives.City police commissioner Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing. ""Regardless of his demands, we couldn't let him play with lives. He fired first at police. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option."" Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the top priority, adding that the police team's response was measured and as per the protocol.The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry, as laid down by law, to verify the claim of retaliatory police firing.While Aarrya did not elaborate on his motive in the video or during police's attempts at negotiations, it emerged that Aarrya had sat on a hunger strike against former school education minister Deepak Kesarkar of Shiv Sena in 2024 over alleged dues of Rs 2 crore for a state-sanctioned school cleanliness project. Kesarkar said he personally gave him some money as a ""gesture of sympathy"" even though the school education department maintained that Aarrya had collected payment directly from some children. He said Aarrya should have taken up the issue with the department instead of holding children hostage.The city crime branch took over the probe. Those rescued were taken to SevenHills Hospital for medical examination.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in Powai.

The bench instead held the four guilty under the Arms Act.The family of one of the slain CRPF constables reacted with anger.

Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ram Manohar Narayan Mishra acknowledged the ""magnitude"" of the terrorist attack on the CRPF camp on the night of Dec 31, 2007, but said they were ""constrained"" by prosecutorial failure to overturn the death sentence pronounced by a trial court in 2019 against Mohd Sharif, Sabauddin, Imran Shahjad and Md Farooq under sections 302 and 149 of IPC.The bench instead held the four guilty under Section 25 (1-A) of the Arms Act, based on the seizure of AK-47 rifles from them, and sentenced them to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh each. A fifth convict serving a life sentence in the case - Jang Bahadur Khan, alias Baba - was acquitted of terrorism charges and convicted for illegal possession of weapons.""The period of imprisonment undergone by the appellants will be adjusted towards the above sentence awarded to them,"" states the order. While observing that it could not deny that the CRPF camp was attacked, ""the defect in investigation ultimately culminated in the acquittal of the accused persons"".""Proving the principal offence beyond reasonable doubt is a golden rule that runs through the web of criminal jurisprudence.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Thursday opposed the bail pleas of activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others in the Supreme Court in the UAPA case linked to the alleged conspiracy behind the February 2020 Delhi riots, claiming they conspired to strike at the country’s sovereignty and integrity through a “regime change operation” disguised as a peaceful protest.The police said the offences were part of a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state, warranting “jail and not bail,” news agency PTI reported quoting an affidavit filed before the top court. The agency said it had collected ocular, documentary and technical evidence showing the accused’s “deep-rooted complicity” in allegedly engineering riots across the country on communal lines.The bail pleas of Khalid, Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and Meeran Haider, all booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, are scheduled to be heard on Friday by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.According to the affidavit, the alleged conspiracy aimed to disrupt communal harmony and instigate crowds “to the extent of armed rebellion.” The police also said the accused planned to escalate tensions during the visit of US President Donald Trump, in order to attract international media attention and portray the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as a global issue.""The materials on record, including chats referencing President Trump, establish that the conspiracy was pre-planned to coincide with his visit,” the affidavit stated, adding that the CAA was used as a “radicalising catalyst” camouflaged as a peaceful movement.The police further alleged that the accused have delayed and obstructed the trial, calling their conduct a ""brazen abuse of process."" It said the argument that there are more than 900 witnesses was misleading, asserting that only 100–150 witnesses are material to the case and can be examined swiftly if the accused cooperate.","Delhi Police oppose bail pleas of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and Meeran Haider.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

Also read |

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

NEW DELHI: Red Chillies Entertainment has told the Delhi high court that Indian Revenue Service officer and former NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede's defamation suit against its Netflix series The Bads of Bollywood is ""misconceived,"" arguing that the show is ""a work of situational satire"" and that Wankhede’s reputation had already been under public ridicule long before its release.In its detailed reply, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned production house said the web series does not name or depict Wankhede, nor does it contain any defamatory material, adding that ""the plaintiff cannot claim reputational harm where none existed to begin with,"" news agency ANI reported.The affidavit stated that Wankhede's public image had already suffered following the 2023 CBI FIR against him for alleged extortion and corruption, undermining his claim of an ""unblemished record.""""The existence of the FIR and the necessity for interim protection belie the plaintiff’s assertions,"" the reply said, adding that he ""was already the subject of public ridicule and adverse commentary"" prior to the show’s release.Red Chillies maintained that The Bads of Bollywood is a satire on the Hindi film industry, exploring themes of celebrity culture, nepotism, and sensationalism through humor and exaggeration — forms of expression protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Challenging the maintainability of the case, the company also argued that the Delhi high court lacks jurisdiction, since both Wankhede and the principal defendants, including Netflix, are based in Mumbai.Referring to a brief, one-minute-forty-eight-second scene that Wankhede objected to, Red Chillies said it “merely portrays an overzealous officer” and carries no defamatory reference.Quoting the Bonnard v. Perryman principle, the reply urged the court to avoid pre-trial injunctions in defamation cases as they amount to prior restraint on free speech.“Satire allows the satirist to criticise in the harshest terms and is not intended to harm reputation. Whether the comment is malicious or artistic can only be determined at trial,” it said.The company further argued that as a public servant, Wankhede “must not be too thin-skinned” and should withstand fair comment and parody. His petition, it said, was an “attempt to stifle legitimate artistic expression.”The Delhi high court has listed the matter for hearing on November 10, after directing all parties to file written submissions.(With ANI inputs)","Indian Revenue Service officer Sameer Wankhede is suing Red Chillies Entertainment for defamation.

EKTA NAGAR, NARMADA: Attacking the Congress for “leaving no stone unturned to erase Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s legacy” and overlooking his contribution in uniting the country after Independence, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the Narendra Modi govt accorded him due recognition by erecting his 182-ft ‘ Statue of Unity ’ at Kevadia, now called Ekta Nagar, and organising an annual parade of all state and Central police forces at the site on his birth anniversary.This year being the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade will get grander. Presided over by the prime minister, it has been upgraded to the scale of the Republic Day parade. It will feature march-past by various state police and Central paramilitary contingents, each led by woman officers, as well as salute by Shaurya Chakra awardees of CRPF and 16 BSF personnel awarded police medals for their valour during Operation Sindoor. Also on display will be heroic stunts by BSF’s Indian breed dogs, daredevilry by motorcycle-borne personnel of the Assam police and BSF’s camel show. Just like the Republic Day parade, tableaux of different state police and paramilitary forces will be part of the parade. Cultural performances, including a grand closing show of dances from various parts of the country featuring 900 artistes, will enthrall the audience as they watch the spectacle with Sardar Patel’s towering statue as the perfect backdrop.A flypast by IAF’s Suryakiran team will match from the sky, the show of colour and talent on the ground.Shah, while addressing a conference on the event in Patna, said the grand parade will not be a one-off event and shall be organised every year on October 31, “similar to the Republic Day parade on January 26”. He said that this parade will serve as a strong medium to inspire the youth of the nation and educate them about Sardar Patel’s principles and his immense contributions to the country.The 150th year tribute to the ‘Iron Man of India” shall continue well beyond Friday. A ‘Bharat Parv’ is being organised here in Ekta Nagar from Nov 1 and shall conclude on the birth anniversary of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda. “This program will showcase a wonderful synthesis of the cultural diversity, food, costumes, crafts, folk art and music of tribes from across the country,” shared Shah.Hailing the role of Sardar Patel in uniting the country’s 562 princely states into one nation as Independent India’s first home minister, Shah said it is unfortunate that after his demise, the opposition left no stone unturned to erase his legacy. “He was awarded the Bharat Ratna after a delay of 41 years and no monument was built in his honour. It was only when Shri Narendra Modi became the chief minister of Gujarat that he conceptualised the Statue of Unity,” he said adding that Ekta Nagar is now an attractive tourist destination with 14 added attractions like the Valley of Flowers, Ekta Nagar Township, Lake Circuit, Light and Sound Show, Patel Garden, Ekta Cruise, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, Ekta Mall and the Glow Torch Viewpoint.","This year being the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade will get grander. Presided over by the prime minister, it has been upgraded to the scale of the Republic Day parade. The 150th year tribute to the ‘Iron Man of India’ shall continue well beyond Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124975451,imgsize-33294,width-400,resizemode-4/cong-erased-patels-legacy-modi-restored-his-rightful-place-shah.jpg"

PATNA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that fulfilling the dreams of Bihar's youth was the ""sankalp"" (resolve) of both ""Narendra and Nitish"", even as he attacked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for allegedly insulting Chhathi Maiya (goddess).Addressing twin election rallies in Muzaffarpur and Chhapra, Modi wove together the promise of youth empowerment with sharp criticism of the opposition, accusing them of misleading voters and disrespecting Bihar's culture and faith.In Muzaffarpur, Modi questioned, ""Will Bihar and Hindustan forgive those who insulted even Chhathi Maiya for votes?"" He was referring to Rahul's recent remark that Modi could even dance on stage for votes and had done ""drama"" in the name of Chhath. ""While your son Modi is trying to get Chhath registered on the Unesco heritage list, Congress-RJD people are insulting Chhathi Maiya for votes. Will Bihar, Hindustan and the mothers and sisters who fast without water during Chhath tolerate such insults and not punish them,"" Modi asked. He added that such comments would not be forgiven ""for hundreds of years to come"".In Chhapra, the PM struck the developmental chord. ""Your dream is my resolution.Narendra and Nitish will realise it. It's time to undertake Bihar's journey from good governance to prosperity. It's your duty to maintain its continuity,"" he said.The PM assured that youth would soon find jobs within the state after the NDA returned to govt, promising to stop migration by creating local employment opportunities. However, he warned young voters against ""false promises"" made by the opposition. ""Their manifesto is nothing but their rate list for what they intend to get in return,"" he said.Targeting RJD and Congress, Modi said their leaders avoided visiting Ayodhya because of ""appeasement and vote-bank politics"". He added that the NDA was committed to blending development with heritage, as seen in projects like the Hariharnath corridor being developed on the lines of Kashi, which he said had boosted tourism and the livelihoods of small vendors. ""Our govt is connecting the treasures of Bihar with employment,"" he said.Modi said while NDA stood for ""padhai, kamai, davai and sichai"", the RJD-Congress symbolised ""katta, krurta, katuta, kushasan and corruption"". ""Law and governance suffer where there is katta and krurta, and social justice is not possible amid corruption,"" he said. The PM asked, ""Can people bring back to power those responsible for jungle raj?""","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said fulfilling the dreams of Bihar's youth was the ""sankalp"" (resolve) of both ""Narendra and Nitish"" Modi wove together the promise of youth empowerment with sharp criticism of the opposition, accusing them of misleading voters and disrespecting Bihar's culture.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124975393,imgsize-1266827,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi.jpg"

He alleged that police did not take prompt action to register FIR. He had petitioned the Bombay high court but police said it had probed the crime and filed a chargesheet.When the HC refused to entertain his petition, Sharif moved SC. A bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kumar allowed his appeal and directed the Maharashtra home secretary ""to constitute an SIT, comprising senior police officers from both Hindu and Muslim communities, to undertake an investigation into all the allegations made by the appellant by registering an FIR in connection with the assault upon him on May 13, 2023, and take appropriate action thereon as warranted.""

SRINAGAR: CM Omar Abdullah urged NC’s newly elected Rajya Sabha members to speak up for J&K’s political rights, warning them not to “lose their voice in Delhi’s pollution” like some of their predecessors. “Sometimes Delhi’s pollution seems to affect our colleagues. We have sent many big names to Parliament in the past, but once they reached there, they appeared to lose their voice,” Omar said Thursday in Handwara.His pointed jab — mixing political frustration with a smog-laced metaphor — drew cheers from supporters in the border town, where he promised that this time, the voices sent to New Delhi “will not fall silent”.The CM’s remarks came amid growing dissent within NC, with two Lok Sabha MPs — Aga Ruhullah Mehdi and Mian Altaf Ahmad — accusing his govt of failing to deliver on political and governance promises.Omar said the three NC members elected to RS last Friday — Chaudhary Mohammad Ramzan, Sajad Ahmad Kichloo and Shammi Oberoi — would “truly represent the people” and press for restoration of statehood and constitutional rights in Parliament.BJP also won one seat, with Sat Sharma clinching victory after a close contest.Recalling that his grandfather Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and father Farooq Abdullah had also sent J&K representatives to Parliament who “suffered the same fate”, Omar said this time he expected better. “I have faith the three members I am sending will become your voice in Parliament,” he said.Praising Ramzan as “the apt candidate”.

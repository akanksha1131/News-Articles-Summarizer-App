NIA takes over Jiribam cases



Missing person case from Loitang Khunou



Appeal for calm



Manipur MLAs' demands



NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Tuesday said that a series of measures by the Central and state governments are under way to address the recent violent incidents in Jiribam. Massive combing operations have been launched in Jiribam and its surrounding areas to apprehend the perpetrators, with Singh pointing out that the operations will continue until those responsible are booked under the rule of law.At a press conference, Singh outlined key resolutions adopted during a recent NDA legislature forum meeting in Manipur. These included a proposal to lift the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from six new police station areas, transferring the investigation of recent killings in Jiribam to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and intensifying counter-terrorism operations .""On November 18, the NDA legislature forum in Manipur took a decision and sent it to the Government of India for implementation. There are 3-4 points, including the removal of AFSPA from the 6 new Police stations (PS areas) and the case relating to Jiribam's heinous killing cases that will be handed over to the NIA, and mass combing operations against those terrorists will be continued. So, these are the few points which we adopted in the meeting and we sent to the Central government,"" the CM said.The chief minister confirmed that the Centre has accepted multiple points from the state’s proposals. The NIA has already taken charge of three key cases linked to the Jiribam violence and issued a press release announcing its involvement.""As requested, the NIA has taken over all three cases related to the Jiribam incidents,"" Singh said. ""The Central and State governments have initiated joint combing operations in Jiribam and adjoining areas. We will continue till the culprits are booked,"" he addedSingh also addressed the disappearance of a person from Loitang Khunou, stating that the police have filed a zero FIR and launched a search operation.""Today, a very unfortunate accident occurred, but not yet confirmed - one person from Loitang Khunou is missing. As per the report available to me, he went inside the Army campus for work, he was doing some financial work there for some officials. But, up to 2pm, he was in connection with his family. But after 2.30pm, the connection with him was lost. His phone turned off. Then the information came to the police and the police have already filed a zero FIR. Searching and investigation is on. We will continue it,"" he said.Amid escalating tensions, the chief minister appealed citizens to remain calm and refrain from violence, stressing the complexity of the issues.""Let us work together with the Government of India to resolve these matters, including the lifting of AFSPA. Violence will not solve these issues. I appeal to the people to stay calm and avoid emotional reactions,"" he said.Earlier, Manipur MLAs passed a resolution demanding a review of AFSPA and a declaration of Kuki militants, allegedly responsible for the Jiribam killings , as an “unlawful organisation.” They also called for a mass operation against the militants and the transfer of key cases to the NIA.The resolution came after the tragic killing of six civilians, including women and children, in Jiribam. In response, the state government temporarily suspended internet services in seven districts to prevent the spread of misinformation and unrest.","Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh outlined key resolutions adopted during a recent NDA legislature forum meeting in Manipur.

PATNA/KOLKATA: A 13-year-old teen who doesn't talk much but lets his bat do all the talking was snapped by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore after an intense bidding at the IPL auction, making him the youngest player to play the world's biggest cricket league.On Monday evening, at faraway Jeddah, the young Bihar prodigy's name, Vaibhav Suryavanshi , was engraved on the annals of Indian Premier League (IPL) when he became the youngest player ever at the age of 13 years and 243 days to land an IPL contract.Vaibhav entered the 2025 IPL mega auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh as the youngest ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. The southpaw was finally bought by the Royals, who outbid intense fight from Delhi Capitals to get the talented teenager with a staggering price.""He is a kind of player who has come on earth to play cricket and go back. He settles for nothing else,"" said Bihar Ranji coach Pramod Kumar.Kumar, under whose watchful eyes Vaibhav is honing his cricketing skills, said the young southpaw is curious to learn various aspects of the game and has a sharp mind.""He can hardly talk. But ask him about cricket and he can go on day and night. He never takes any rest on the ground. Even during lunch or tea break, he is with me for fielding practice or knocking away or stretching with a senior player,"" he said.Records came hand-in-hand with Vaibhav as he recently made headlines after becoming the youngest international centurion in the 170-year history of competitive cricket at 13 years and 188 days in September this year.The opener scored a 62-ball 104, studded with 14 hits to the fence and four towering sixes, in the 1st youth test for India Under-19 against Australia Under-19 in Chennai.Vaibhav reached the three-figure mark in just 58 balls, which made him the fastest Indian youth test centurion, too, and the second-fastest in the world.Hailing from Samastipur, Bihar, he was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai at just 12 years and 284 days. With this feat, the rookie broke records held for years by the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar.""He has always been getting attention from the crowd where he went to play Ranji trophy for being the youngest player and his enthusiasm on the ground,"" the coach says, adding he has no fear of fast bowling despite being the youngest in the team.Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a small farmer in Tajpur, Samastipur, and a part-time journalist with Hindi daily, was on cloud nine when his son Vaibhav called up from Dubai, where he is playing Asia Cup U-19 championship. His first match will be against Pakistan on November 30.""Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC) both had called him up for trial in Nagpur and Delhi. In Nagpur, he was asked to score 17 runs in one over. He hit three huge sixes in first three balls itself, making him a strong contender for RR team. He performed excellently in DC trials also. That's why DC was also interested in buying my son,"" the proud father said, while talking to TOI.Sanjeev recently sold his one kattha of land in Tajpur for the better future of his son's dream.Vaibhav is also the fourth youngest in the country to make first-class debut and the second youngest from Bihar when he played against Mumbai in Patna on January 6.Vaibhav played for Bihar in the 2023 edition of the Cooch Behar Trophy . In one of the matches against Jharkhand, he scored 151 runs off 128 balls with the help of 22 fours and three sixes. In the same match, he also scored 76. He also played in a quadrangular series involving India U-19 A, India U-19 B, England U-19 and Bangladesh U-19. He got scores of 53, 74, 0, 41 and 0 in the tournament. So far he has played 5 first-class games.Suryavanshi's meteoric rise in the last couple of years is more incredible in the backdrop of the controversy-ravaged Bihar cricket , which has made more news for wrong reasons ever since coming back into BCCI domestic fold from oblivion ahead of the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy.","Bihar prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 13, becomes youngest player to play in IPL.

World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday. (Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore.

MUMBAI: With no decision in the Mahayuti yet on who will be CM, Eknath Shinde , accompanied by deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar , met governor CP Radhakrishnan and tendered his resignation and that of his cabinet. The governor has asked Shinde to continue to hold charge of his post till alternate arrangements are made, so Shinde will continue as caretaker CM.Sena MLA Deepak Kesarkar said the resignation is a formality and a decision on the new CM will be taken in New Delhi. With clamour growing in the Sena for him to be CM again, Shinde appealed to Sena workers - some of whom came up with the slogan ''Ek'nath hain to safe hain' to push for him as CM - not to gather at Varsha, the CM's official residence, to demand that he be made CM.Shinde said in a post on X, ""After the great victory of Mahayuti, our govt will be formed once again in the state. As Mahayuti, we contested the election together and are still together today. Out of love for me, some congregations have appealed to everyone to gather together and come to Mumbai. I am deeply grateful for your love. But I appeal that no one should come together in my support in such a manner. Once again, it is my humble request that Shiv Sena workers should not assemble at Varsha or anywhere else.

Kadam said that NCP had said that they were 'okay' with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM. ""We feel Eknath Shinde should be CM, BJP thinks Fadnavis should be CM. Ajit Pawar has surrendered. He has reduced our bargaining power. No matter what happens, there will be no spat in the Mahayuti. We fought the polls under Eknath Shinde and we have got big success,"" Kadam, a former minister, said.He added, ""People have given a huge mandate to the Mahayuti. We are together and we will abide by whatever decision New Delhi takes. PM Modi and Amit Shah put faith in Shinde and fought the polls. We will come together and take Maharashtra forward on the path of development. We have full faith in Delhi's leadership. , Before the elections, Amit Shah had said that all three parties would sit and decide. Nothing apart from this was said.""While Ajit Pawar was on Sunday unanimously elected group leader of the NCP legislature party, sources said on the question of the chief minister's post, the party has taken the view that in view of the assembly polls results, it would be appropriate if Devendra Fadnavis is placed at the helm of affairs in the state.Sena MP Naresh Mhaske had said on Monday that Shinde should be declared CM by the NDA top brass by following the 'Bihar pattern.'","Eknath Shinde, accompanied by deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, met governor CP Radhakrishnan and tendered his resignation and that of his cabinet.

Five years after Uddhav Thackeray 's Shiv Sena claimed that there was an agreed ""deal"" with the BJP over rotational chief minister, now Eknath Shinde 's Sena says there was a ""deal"" with the saffron party for the top job if Mahayuti won the 2024 assembly elections.A Shiv Sena leader, who is close to caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde, has claimed that there was an agreement after the Lok Sabha elections that Shinde would take over the reins of the state if Mahayuti won the assembly polls.Read more- Maharashtra govt formation: Deal was Shiv Sena chief would be CM, says neta close to Eknath Shinde The Sena leader said that after the Mahayuti's debacle in the LS polls, there were a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the assembly elections. ""In these meetings, it was decided that BJP would contest the maximum number of seats followed by Shiv Sena and NCP, but ""irrespective of the number of seats the Mahayuti constituents win, Shinde will continue to be the CM if Mahayuti secures a clear majority,"" the leader claimed.The Shiv Sena, which won 57 seats in the assembly elections, is making a strong pitch for continuity at the top and wants the BJP to let Eknath Shinde continue as Mahayuti's chief minister. However, the BJP, with 132 seats in its kitty, which is only 12 short of the half-way mark in the 288-member assembly, is firm about Devendra Fadnavis leading the new government.Rejecting Sena's contentions, BJP leaders say that Union home minister Amit Shah had made it clear during the course of the elections that while Mahayuti was contesting the assembly polls under the leadership of Shinde, but in the event of it securing a clear majority, the new CM would be decided by BJP's parliamentary board and heads of Shiv Sena and NCP.In 2019, after the assembly election results were out, the BJP had faced a similar challenge. The BJP and Shiv Sena, then united under NDA, had secured a comprehensive victory to retain power in the state winning 161 seats after a five-year term under Devendra Fadnavis. However, Uddhav's party, which had won only 56 seats compared to BJP's 105, claimed that the then BJP chief Amit Shah had agreed on rotational chief ministership for the two parties.Amit Shah strongly denied Uddhav's claim. ""No such promise was ever made to them. I make promises not in a closed-door room, but in public meetings—out in the open, in a loud and clear voice,"" Amit Shah had then said at a public gathering.As the rift over the issue widened, Shiv Sena severed its ties with the BJP and formed a post-poll alliance with NCP and Congress under the banner of Maha Vikas Aghadi and Uddhav Thackeray became the chief minister.However, 2024 is different from 2019. The BJP, with 132 seats under its belt, is in a commanding position and none of its allies is in a position to dictate terms to the saffron party. While Eknath Shinde's party may be pressing hard for the top post, it would not want to strain ties with the BJP and lose the gains it has made in the last two-and-half years. It will be interesting to see how the BJP reacts to Shinde Sena's claim of ""pre-election deal"".","Eknath Shinde's Sena says there was a ""deal"" with the saffron party for the top job if Mahayuti won the 2024 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Russia is eager to invest in and expand the manufacturing of trains and their components in India to meet its domestic requirements, a senior railway ministry official said on Tuesday. Last week, Russian railway major TMH had expressed interest in this plan.In response to a question on Russian investment in the railway sector in India, a top govt official said, “They have huge domestic requirements and for that they want to set up manufacturing facilities here. They want to get these supplies from India.”The CEO of TMH, Kirill Lipa told a group of Indian journalists at the company’s headquarters in Moscow, “The current interest rate in India is very different from other countries. So, we are interested and ready to invest in India. We are interested in developing several facilities in India, which are capable of providing certain components and we think some of them can be supplied to the Russian market as well.”Mentioning that Russia currently has several supply contracts from India, Lipa said, “We have a historically good relationship with suppliers there (India) and that means we can increase this import into Russia from India.”TMH is the major stakeholder in Kinet Railway Solutions, which has signed approximately Rs 55,000 crore contract with Indian Railways to produce 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches and maintain them for 35 years. Lipa said they are “not looking at getting any supply from Russia” for Vande Bharat project.“We found basic suppliers within India or some other countries which are more or less oriented for the relationship between India and Russia,” he said while claiming that the current sanctions will not have any implications on the project.","Last week, Russian railway major TMH had expressed interest in this plan.

SC: Suspicion of EVM fixing ‘unfounded’

NEW DELHI: Noting that it was only losing candidates who suspected tampering of electronic voting machines (EVMs), Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea seeking that voting be done through paper ballot and asked the petitioner to raise his grievances before the appropriate authority.""What happens is, if you win the elections, EVMs are not tampered. When you lose elections, EVMs are tampered,"" a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale said. Petitioner K A Paul, who argued himself, said most countries had gone back to paper ballot voting as EVMs could be tampered with. He tried to convince the court to at least issue a notice to the EC.Trying to convince the court to at least issue notice on his plea pushing for paper ballot and seek response from Election Commission, the petitioner said even Tesla chief Elon Musk had recently said that EVMs could be tampered.

Now, this time, Jagan Mohan Reddy has lost, he said EVMs can be tampered,” the bench said.The petitioner also highlighted other flaws like cash and liquor distribution in the election process and sought the court’s intervention to check it. He said EC had seized Rs 9,000 crore so far this year. In April, SC had dismissed a batch of petitions seeking a return to the paper ballot system. Terming the suspicion of manipulation of EVMs “unfounded”, the court had then rejected the demand for reverting to the old system, saying the polling devices were “secured” and eliminated booth capturing and bogus voting.","Petitioner K A Paul said most countries had gone back to paper ballot voting.

NEW DELHI: Virtually ruling out a mega oil refinery in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri, the govt is holding talks with Saudi authorities for two refineries in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, each with an annual capacity of 10-15 million tonnes, along with petrochemical facilities.While ONGC has been proposed to partner Saudi Aramco for the refinery in Gujarat, BPCL will be roped in for the one planned in Andhra. For the Saudis, the refineries will enable the sale of crude to India, given that the share of oil from the Gulf nation in the Indian basket has decreased over the years.The discussions, which are in advanced stages, come ahead of PM Modi's meeting with the Saudi leadership next month to tap into the oil-rich nation's earlier promise to invest $100 billion in India, which has been slow to come by despite the govt identifying railways, ports and waterways as areas of interest.While the refinery in Ratnagiri was among the identified projects, progress on land acquisition has been slow due to resistance from locals.Besides, there was a growing view that it would be tough to have a 60-million-tonne refinery, for which Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) had signed a preliminary agreement with Saudi Aramco, with Adnoc joining in later.Gujarat, which already boasts of refineries in Jamnagar (Reliance and Nyara Energy) and Vadodara (Indian Oil), is likely to get a fourth one. In case of Andhra Pradesh, an oil refinery was proposed at the time of bifurcation of the state, and the govt led by N Chandrababu Naidu, who is now part of NDA, is seeking that Centre delivers on its promise.While the configuration and other details have not been worked out, sources indicated that the projects are at discussion stage, along with other proposals, some of which will be faster to implement. ""Oil refineries take time, and the two proposed projects will require more detailed work before we progress on them,"" a source told TOI.The Saudi side is also seeking comfort in investment promotion through a revised bilateral investment treaty, an issue on which finance ministry has had concerns. ""It could be an added sweetener, but since the deal will be at the level of two govts, there may be some other way out,"" another source said.","The govt is holding talks with Saudi authorities for two refineries in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, each with an annual capacity of 10-15 million tonnes.

He labelled Rahul's approach as that of a ""seasonal politician"" whose ideology shifted with electoral tides.Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, revenue minister in Maharashtra's outgoing govt, also condemned Rahul's statement, asking how Congress's new political allies would react to these perceived insults to Savarkar's legacy.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X, ""Rahul Gandhi is vile and predictable.

NEW DELHI: Former Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Tuesday addressed recent allegations from Shiv Sena (UBT)leader Sanjay Raut , who claimed that Chandrachud’s handling of petitions regarding disqualification of MLAs contributed to the Maha Vikas Aghadi 's (MVA) defeat in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections .Speaking to ANI in an exclusive interview, Justice Chandrachud dismissed these allegations, emphasizing the Supreme Court's focus on significant constitutional matters during his tenure. ""Throughout this year, we were dealing with seminal constitutional cases, nine-judge bench decisions, seven-judge bench decisions, five-judge bench decisions. Should any one party or individual decide what case the Supreme Court should hear? Sorry, that choice is for the Chief Justice,"" he said.Sanjay Raut had alleged that by not ruling on disqualification petitions of defectors from the Shiv Sena, Justice Chandrachud ""removed the fear of the law"" among politicians, which led to the collapse of the MVA government and their subsequent electoral loss.In the November 20 elections, Shiv Sena (UBT) won only 20 out of 94 seats it contested as part of the MVA alliance, with Congress securing 16 out of 101 seats and the NCP (Sharad Pawar) winning just 10 of 86. Raut accused the judiciary of delaying decisions, impacting their political fortunes, and declared that ""history will not forgive them.""Justice Chandrachud, however, defended the judiciary's priorities. ""Important constitutional cases are pending before the Supreme Court for 20 years. Why is the Supreme Court not taking up these 20-year-old cases and dealing with some recent cases? You have limited manpower and a given complement of judges, you have to draw the balance,"" he said.Further responding to Raut's claim that the court delayed the Sena's disqualification case, Chandrachud criticised the expectation that courts should align with political agendas. ""The real problem is this, that a given segment of the polity feels that, well, you're independent if you follow my agenda... We decided electoral bonds. Was that any less important?"" he said, listing other cases handled during his tenure, including disability rights, the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, and significant judgments affecting federal structures and livelihoods.Talking about the claims of his involvement in furthering specific political agenda, Chandrachud also reacted to Rahul Gandhi's recent remark that the Opposition has taken on the judiciary's role. The ex-CJI said, ""People should not presume that the judiciary should be performing the role of the opposition in Parliament or the State legislatures. We are here to scrutinize laws.""The former CJI went on to defend his social interactions with political leaders, describing such meetings as ""elementary social courtesy"" that does not compromise judicial independence. He called on critics to assess the judiciary's work rather than dwell on social engagements.Chandrachud also reflected on the broader challenges of his role, particularly pressure from well-resourced litigants. ""Very highly resourced persons come to the court and try to suborn the system by saying, well, my case should be heard first. Sorry, we are not going to give that priority,"" he asserted, adding that the judiciary must resist such influences to remain impartial.He also dismissed suggestions of political pressure on the judiciary, referencing cases like Article 370, Ayodhya, and Sabarimala, where decisions were made without external interference. ""If there was pressure, why did the Supreme Court wait to take such a decision on that case?"" he questioned, reiterating the judiciary's independence.However, Justice Chandrachud highlighted systemic issues within the judiciary, calling for increased investment in infrastructure and an All-India Judicial Service Examination to address the 21% vacancy rate in district courts. He did note the Supreme Court's aim to address cases involving marginalized communities, citing over 21,000 bail applications resolved during his tenure.Justice Chandrachud retired on November 10 after a two-year tenure as Chief Justice of India, leaving behind a legacy marked by significant constitutional rulings and steadfast defense of judicial independence.","Former Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud addresses recent allegations from Shiv Sena (UBT)leader Sanjay Raut. Raut claimed that Chandrchud’s handling of petitions regarding disqualification of MLAs contributed to the Maha Vikas Aghadi's (MVA) defeat in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections. Justice ChandRachud dismissed these allegations, emphasizing the Supreme Court's focus on significant constitutional matters during his tenure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115705830,imgsize-377263,width-400,resizemode-4/115705830.jpg"

MUMBAI: In perhaps the longest 'digital detention' in the city by cyber fraudsters posing as law enforcers, a 77-year-old south Mumbai woman was kept under 'digital custody' for more than a month.

The caller told her the parcel she had sent to Taiwan had been stopped and it contained five passports, a bank card, 4kg of clothes and MDMA drug, and so on. The woman told the caller she had not sent any parcel to anyone. The caller then said her Aadhar card details were used in the crime and asked her to talk to a Mumbai police officer.

She was ordered not to disconnect and not to tell anyone about the case. A man posing as Anand Rana, IPS officer, sought details of her bank accounts.

UDAIPUR: Rajasthan authorities took control of portions of Udaipur's iconic City Palace Tuesday following violent clashes between two factions of Mewar royal descendants. The unrest stemmed from a decades-long property and succession dispute reignited by a ritual linked to the coronation of Mewar's kings.The conflict pits the family of Arvind Singh Mewar, chairman of Maharana of Mewar Charitable Foundation (MMCF) and younger son of Udaipur's last king Bhagwat Singh Mewar, against descendants of his elder brother Mahendra Singh Mewar, who died on Nov 10 at 83.Mahendra's son Vishvaraj Singh, the BJP MLA for Nathdwara, declared himself the 77th titular head of Mewar royal family and held a ""coronation"" ceremony Monday at Fateh Prakash Palace in Chittorgarh Fort.As part of his accession ritual, Vishvaraj sought entry to a shrine within City Palace, sparking resistance from MMCF and his uncle's family. MMCF had issued public notices barring unauthorised access to the palace and Eklingji temple, both of which are under the trust's control. The trust cited a family history exhibit at the palace that claims Mahendra Singh ""voluntarily and seceded from the family of his father"".Vishvaraj attempted to visit the palace shrine but was blocked, resulting in a scuffle that escalated to stone-throwing outside the mansion. Several people, including police officers, were wounded. The dispute dates back to 1983, when Mahendra Singh challenged his father over leasing and selling stakes in royal properties since 1963. These assets had been transferred to a company established by the family. ""Through his final will dated May 15, 1984, Maharana Bhagwat Singh Mewar appointed Arvind Singh Mewar as executor of the will, which has been probated up to SC,"" said MMCF advocate Sheetal Kumbhat.The trust continues to control several properties, including City Palace and Eklingji temple. This long-standing rift saw the two brothers living separately: Arvind at Shambhu Niwas within City Palace and Mahendra at the nearby Samor Bagh mansion.Vishvaraj criticised the district administration: ""It is my right to visit the temple of my ancestors on such a special occasion. I sought administration's assistance, but they did not help. No one can be stopped from visiting a place of worship.""Arvind's son Lakshyaraj accused his cousin of politicising the situation and misusing his position. ""We are legal occupants of City Palace. If they have any objection, this can be challenged in the court of law,"" he said.

The latest updates from the government have provided no clarity on when physical classes might resume.While the air quality in Delhi has improved slightly, with AQI levels dipping below the 300-mark on Monday morning, the pollution levels still remain in the ‘poor’ category. This continues to be a concern for residents, especially for children and elderly people.

The interim govt also doubled down on the charges against Chinmoy Krishna saying the country's judiciary is fully independent and it does not interfere in the work of the judiciary.The Indian govt, which has repeatedly taken up the issue of safety of minority communities with the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt in Dhaka, also asked Bangladesh authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.""We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote.

I have never attempted to encroach on the turf of others (judiciary and legislature),"" Modi said at a function organised by Supreme Court to celebrate the 75th year of the adoption of the Constitution.The remark was possibly aimed at SCBA president and MP Kapil Sibal, who said that to protect the values of the Constitution and centrality of the people to governance, SC must keep reminding the govt of the day about its duties to preserve the independence of the judiciary. Modi said, ""Some wise man raised this issue, that's why I thought it fit to place my view. For this august gathering, a hint is enough and requires no elaboration.""Modi's response appeared to be an extension of a political battle that played out through the day in the public arena on Constitution Day , with govt and opposition duking it out over who represented a threat to the statute.Modi began his speech by paying homage to victims of the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai and said while the country celebrates Constitution Day and pays homage to the framers of the Constitution, which remains the guiding light for his govt, ""we must not forget the heinous terror attack on this day in 2008.

NEW DELHI: In defence of more than 22,000 trial court judges saddled with a monstrous pendency of over 4.5 crore cases, Supreme Court said the SC and high courts, in exercise of their appellate jurisdiction, cannot resort to personal criticism of judicial officers' conduct while correcting errors in their judgments.Expunging Delhi HC's critical personal remarks against additional sessions and district judge Sonu Agnihotri, a bench of Justices A S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and A G Masih said, ""The HC could not have used a judgment on the judicial side to advise individual judicial officers. That can only be done on the administrative side in an appropriate case.""Referring to spiralling litigation, the bench said in 2002, SC in All India Judges Association case had issued a direction that “within five years, an endeavour should be made to increase the judge-topopulation ratio in our trial judiciary to 50 per million”. “However, till 2024, we have not even reached the ratio of 25 per million. Meanwhile, population and litigation have substantially increased. The judges have to work under stress,” it said. SC said even the best judges, whether in a trial court, HC or in SC, are likely to commit errors due to work pressure or otherwise, even though most of their judgments would be sound in both fact and law.HCs can always correct errors, but in that process if strictures are passed personally against a judicial officer, it both prejudices him and causes embarrassment, the Justice Oka-led bench said. “We must remember that when we sit in constitutional courts, even we are prone to making mistakes. Therefore, personal criticism of judges or recording findings on the conduct of judges in judgments must be avoided,” the bench said. “There is a difference between criticising erroneous orders and criticising a judicial officer. The first part is permissible. The second category of criticism should best be avoided,” it said.HC had criticised the additional sessions judge (ASJ) for taking Delhi Police to task for its lethargic approach in updating investigation status despite repeated orders. SC ordered that all critical personal comments against ASJ in the HC judgment be expunged.","Till 2024, ‘judge to population’ ratio yet to reach 25/m: SC.

RAIPUR: The Border Roads Organization (BRO) has stepped into dreaded Maoist commander Hidma's den in Bastar division to build roads that no civilian contractor dared take up. BRO is known for its expertise in building roads in treacherous, mountainous regions of Ladakh and the North-East, and Chhattisgarh is perhaps the only Maoist-affected state where it has been deployed, said an officer. BRO teams started work in a remote part of Bijapur on Monday.In 2004-06, during a period of intense Maoist violence, BRO had constructed a 100km road between Jagdalpur and Geedam in Dantewada. It's still the best in Bastar. This time, the assignment has taken the road specialists to the most volatile hotbed of Maoist insurgency in Bastar. BRO will build two roads, from Hidma's Puwarti village to Silger, and from Tarrem to Kondapalli.Puwarti is Hidma's native village and barely 2km from Tekulguda where 23 security personnel were killed in a Maoist ambush in April 2021. And Silger was the site of intense protests after three villagers were killed in police firing on May 17, 2021.Local contractors were too scared to take up projects in these areas and multiple tenders got no response. According to sources, the Union home minister intervened and BRO was given the task.Officials are not sharing details of the routes but said that Tarrem and Kondapalli road will be 18km long and the one from Silger to Puwarti is planned to be 11km. The Tarrem-Kondapalli stretch is expected to be completed by June 2025 and will cost around Rs 40 crore. ""This is another step towards achieving the target of Union home minister Amit Shah 's vow to eliminate Maoists by March 2026,"" Bastar range IG P Sundarraj said.It’s believed that around 200 Maoists are in this region to provide security to Hidma and carry out insurgency. It has the largest concentration of PLGA cadres, and the routes planned by the govt have great strategic importance. Asked about deployment of security during road construction, Bijapur collector Sambit Mishra told TOI, “BRO is constructing roads on the most critical junctions of Bijapur.There are around five CRPF security camps at Tarrem, Chinnagelur, Gundem, Chutwahi and Kondapalli. CoBRA and Special Task Force personnel conduct ops.”Three more road projects are in the pipeline, awaiting approval — Kondapalli to Pamed (26km), Meenagudam to Kanchal (13km) and Elmagunda to Puvarti (51km).The new roads will not only allow security forces quick access to core Maoist zones, but also help the govt reach its welfare and development schemes to villages. Health and education facilities will improve significantly, so will mobile connectivity, said officials. It’s a turning point in the decades-old conflict, where IED-mined roads have a dark history of blood and death.","Border Roads Organization (BRO) has stepped into dreaded Maoist commander Hidma's den in Bastar division.

Online post says ‘Goldy Brar’ and Bishnoi aide behind blasts

CHANDIGARH: Low-intensity blasts Tuesday outside two nightclubs in Chandigarh, one of them owned by singer-rapper Badshah, spawned conspiracy theories before gangster Lawrence Bishnoi 's associate Goldy Brar claimed responsibility for both.Police found CCTV footage showing one among two suspects on a motorcycle hurling the bombs at 3.14am. Barring a shattered glass door at the entrance to one of the clubs, no damage was caused by either of the blasts.Investigators said the attack, coming a week ahead of PM Modi's scheduled visit to Chandigarh, was possibly meant to be a warning or a threat to the owners of both clubs - De Orra and Seville. Badshah owns the first one.Sector 26 police station is located barely 100 metres from the scene of twin explosions. A Central Forensic Science Laboratory team collected samples from the site. Chandigarh Police mentioned in a statement strips of jute were scattered where bombs landed. Hours later, a Facebook post from an account in the name of “Goldy Brar” said he and Rohit Godara of Bishnoi gang masterminded the blasts because owners of the clubs hadn’t paid “protection money”. The post mentioned the owners didn’t heed repeated reminders, the consequences of which would be more such attacks.Police sources said footage from one CCTV camera shows the assailants speeding away towards Mohali after hurling the bombs. This is the second such explosion in the city in three months. On Sept 11, two suspects hurled a grenade at a house in Sector 10. Nobody was injured. Police arrested the autorickshaw driver who had allegedly ferried the duo to the area from ISBT-43 the same day.","Online post says ‘Goldy Brar’ and Bishnoi aide behind blasts. Police found CCTV footage showing one among two suspects on a motorcycle hurling the bombs at 3.14am. Barring a shattered glass door at the entrance to one of the clubs, no damage was caused by either of the blasts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115712975,imgsize-18732,width-400,resizemode-4/115712975.jpg"

While the CM is yet to react to Gaviyappa's suggestions, deputy CM and state Congress president D K Shivakumar was quick to condemn the proposals.Terming them out-of-line with the party's commitment to people, he said a show-cause notice will be issued to Gaviyappa. ""No MLA of Congress should question guarantee schemes. We will initiate action if anyone does so,"" Shivakumar said. His comments came after a video of Gaviyappa seeking withdrawal of some of the schemes was widely circulated online.Addressing a public meeting in his home constituency recently, the MLA said, ""It has become difficult to provide houses to people due to guarantee schemes. I request the CM to cancel two-three guarantee schemes that are not needed. Then, at least, we will be able to provide houses. Let's see what the CM says."" Gaviyappa in his speech expressed frustration at insufficient funds allocated to his constituency. Reports suggest Vijayanagara received only Rs 22 crore compared to Rs 60-70 crore allocated to its neighbouring constituencies.Disapproving of the views, Shivakumar was stern in warning the MLA. ""He cannot do this. There is no question of stopping any guarantee scheme. We are committed to people of the state.

SECI deal

amid US bribery scandal last resort: AP mantri

VIJAYAWADA: The Chandrababu Naidu-led govt in Andhra Pradesh is exploring a number of options to make the 2021 Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) deal more palatable after the bribery scandal allegedly involving the Adani Group was reported in the US.Sources told TOI the state govt was not in favour of scrapping the deal, given the legal complications involved. Instead, it was negotiating the possibility of setting up the solar plant in Andhra instead of another state. This would substantially reduce transmission costs. If the power was available with minimal transmission cost, Rs 2.49 per unit was reasonable, said a senior minister.The TDP govt has argued that although Rs 2.4 per unit of solar power was reasonable, they would have to pay an additional Rs 1.7 per unit as transmission cost as the original plan included drawing power from Rajasthan.The Jagan-led YSRC govt in AP at the time had originally proposed signing an agreement with Adani Group to purchase 9,000 MW of solar power. As it had drawn severe criticism from the opposition, which alleged unilateral allotment of the contract to Adani Group, without competitive bidding, the state govt retracted from its original proposal and later announced the proposed deal with SECI for the purchase of 7,000 MW for agriculture use.The minister added that the TDP-led NDA govt's aim was to bring more investment into Andhra Pradesh and create job opportunities. ""We are an industry-friendly govt. We want more investors to come in. Scrapping the SECI deal because of the bribery scandal in the US is the last option to consider,"" he said.Sources said if setting up the plant is not possible, the state govt may propose a price revision in accordance with prevailing market prices. State finance minister and TDP veteran Payyavula Keshav was the first to object to the deal in 2021 when he was in opposition.On the other hand, the state govt is also considering legal opinion on initiating a probe into the corruption allegations. Sources said the state govt is waiting for the Centre to take a decision on the issue before taking a call.Andhra Pradesh was at the centre of the alleged bribery scandal that broke out in the US earlier this month in which Adani Group's top executives, including Gautam Adani, were indicted on criminal charges by Eastern District Court of New York. The indictment alleged that Rs 2,029 crore was offered as bribes to ""Indian govt officials"" for signing power purchase agreements (PPAs).Out of the total Rs 2,029 crore, Rs 1,750 crore was allegedly offered to a high-ranking official in the AP govt, mentioned as ""foreign official#1"" in the documents.According to the indictment, the official was offered Rs 1,750 crore, causing state discoms to agree to purchase seven gigawatts of solar power from SECI under the manufacturing linked project.","The Chandrababu Naidu-led govt in Andhra Pradesh is exploring a number of options to make the 2021 Solar Energy Corporation of India deal more palatable.

Crane's reverse migration path remarkable, say specialists

AIPUR: A tagged Siberian Demoiselle crane has soared further in the pecking order of long flights, taking a detour to wing over 3,676km to Rajasthan and setting a new distance record for migratory birds arriving in the state.Nicknamed Sukpak, the crane swooped down to Khichan in Phalodi district. It was clicked by an Australian tourist, Carolyn Synnott, at Khichan's renowned feeding station. Sukpak was identified by a distinctive yellow-blue ring on its leg. The previous longest recorded flight for a Demoiselle crane was about 2,800km, for a bird tagged in Mongolia. ""This is a male crane, tagged by our team on July 20, 2024. He was the elder of a two-chick brood,"" said Elena Mudrik, a Russian crane researcher.Dau Lal Bohra, member of a Crane Specialist Group at International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and a contributor to the 1000 Crane Project, attributed Sukpak's record-breaking distance to the fact that it was ringed - tagged for identification - in far-flung Tyva, a republic in south-central Siberia of Russia.""Tyva borders northwestern Mongolia and lies in the upper Yenisey river basin. Due to the region's harsh conditions, this was the first time researchers successfully ringed birds there. Since the ringing was done at a further location, it increased the migration distance,"" said Bohra.What makes Sukpak's journey more remarkable is its unexpected route through Pakistan. ""Traditionally, Demoiselle cranes cross Himalayan valleys and enter India via Nepal. However, Sukpak's route traversed Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan before it entered India through Jaisalmer. This is the reverse of the usual migration path, typically observed during their return journey. It is the most significant discovery in Demoiselle crane migration patterns,"" Bohra said.At present, nearly 20,000 Demoiselle cranes - Kurjan in local parlance - are roosting at Khichan for their winter sojourn. Recently designated as a conservation reserve, Khichan has become a safe haven for these majestic birds. ""Khichan is India's first reserve for Demoiselle cranes. This milestone not only enriches our understanding of bird migration but also highlights the need to conserve these species and their habitats,"" an expert said.","Nicknamed Sukpak, the crane swooped down to Khichan in Phalodi district.

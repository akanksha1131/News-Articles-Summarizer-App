"Maharashtra goes to polls today: Battle hinges on sops, jobs, quota & crop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-goes-to-polls-today-battle-hinges-on-sops-jobs-quota-crop/articleshow/115467156.cms,"MUMBAI: Cash, Caste, Crop, and perhaps Community. That pretty much defines the main factors at play as Maharashtra heads into an election on Wednesday.This is the first assembly poll since the dramatic split of Shiv Sena and NCP, which led to major political realignments and comes barely six months after the Lok Sabha results in which the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi came out on top. Wresting 30 of the state's 48 seats, it left the governing Mahayuti reeling with a tally of 17, even though the difference in vote-share of the two fronts was less than 1%. In terms of leads, Mahayuti was ahead in 125 segments while the MVA was leading in 153.However, the Haryana verdict has given BJP and allies an impetus in the form of an unprecedented third term. They have since worked overtime to counter anti-incumbency in one of India's largest states. This includes carpet-bombing the electorate with sops, such as a monthly income support scheme, Mukhya Mantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, which is patterned on the Madhya Pradesh model. Five installments of Rs 1,500 have reached over 2.3 crore women.Its popularity is evident from the manifestos released by both fronts - they are offering even more sops for women. While Mahayuti has offered Rs 2,100 per month if it is voted back, MVA has offered a monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 under Mahalakshmi scheme.But will this counter public discontent over other issues? Low procurement prices for soyabean and cotton farmers can be a decisive factor in Vidarbha and Marathwada. During the Lok Sabha polls, Mahayuti faced a backlash in these regions. Inflation and unemployment also continue to simmer. Indeed, the opposition argues that rising prices counter the gains from the Ladki Bahin stipend.The opposition has also invoked Marathi asmita or pride by focusing on Adani group's presence in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project and the flight of industry and jobs from Maharashtra to Gujarat. Ajit Pawar's revelation that industrialist Gautam Adani had attended a meeting at his residence to discuss the possibility of a BJP-NCP govt in 2019 led to opposition allegations that the industrialist was involved in toppling the MVA govt.The Mahayuti campaign has also adopted a majoritarian theme by dropping terms such as ""vote jihad"" and ""dharma yuddh"" to counter the consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of MVA candidates. The BJP manifesto calls for an anti-conversion law. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath's slogan ""batenge to katenge"" gained usage as divisive propaganda for the BJP poll machine. PM Narendra Modi's slogan, ""ek hain toh safe hain"", was seen as an effort to moderate the tone.""In the Lok Sabha polls, the opposition set the narrative with its anti-Modi campaign and the threat of the Constitution being changed and the Mahayuti parties had to respond to it. In the state polls, the ruling parties seem to have set the narrative with the Ladki Bahin Yojana and the 'batenge to katenge' slogan and the opposition has had to respond to it,"" said senior journalist Abhay Deshpande.How crucial will caste be to the assembly poll results? In the LS polls, the agitation for Maratha quota led by activist Manoj Jarange led to defeat of BJP stalwarts including Raosaheb Danve and Pankaja Munde. Though he threatened to field candidates again this time, Jarange decided to stall. The issue may simmer and provoke a reaction from the OBC community. But BJP has increased outreach to OBCs, which are its core base.The splitting of the two major regional parties - Shiv Sena and NCP - continues to cast its shadow over the state. Indeed, the unlikely post-poll alliances and changes in govt have led voters to question the value of their vote.Shiv Sena of Eknath Shinde and Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) are pitted in direct contests on 51 seats. A similar war will rage between NCP (Sharad Pawar group) and Ajit Pawar's NCP in 36 seats. It's unclear if the parent party in both cases will gain public sympathy. The party that loses out could face an exodus or political oblivion.Rebel candidates could queer the pitch for both fronts. And small parties and Independents, too, will play a key role in close contests. The smaller parties include Maharashtra Navnirman Sena of Raj Thackeray, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi led by Prakash Ambedkar, the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh led by Mahadev Jankar, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi led by Hitendra Thakur.Whichever alliance wins will have to face the challenge of managing the state's precarious financial condition. Debt is upward of Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Fiscal deficit is expected to be Rs 2 lakh crore, much beyond norm. And dropping schemes after winning the poll will not be an easy task.","This is the first assembly poll since the dramatic split of Shiv Sena and NCP.

NEW DELHI: For the second year in succession, the G20 declaration refrained from explicitly condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while diluting further the support for Kyiv amid pressure from the incoming Trump administration to end the war.While G20 Delhi Declaration too was seen as soft on Russia, focused as it was more on social consequences of the war than on holding Moscow liable, it had seven paragraphs dedicated to addressing the situation as against just one specifically on Ukraine in the Rio Declaration. The western powers also agreed to omit from the Rio Declaration PM Modi's big message to Russian President Vladimir Putin - this isn't the era of war - that found mention in both Bali and Delhi joint statements.The Delhi declaration, which India dramatically pulled off through an eleventh-hour consensus, had a standalone paragraph that just said today’s era must not be of war. The same sentence had been used earlier in 2022 Bali declaration.The summit took place against the backdrop of a likely escalation in the war with the US having approved use of long-range missiles by Ukraine against Russia. While seeking a comprehensive ceasefire, the Rio joint communique recalled discussions in New Delhi and highlighted human suffering and negative added impacts of the war with regard to global food and energy security, supply chains, macro-financial stability, inflation and growth. “We welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just and durable peace, upholding all purposes and principles of UN Charter for promotion of peaceful, friendly, and good neighbourly relations,” it said.The Delhi joint statement, which was endorsed by Russia as a more balanced outcome, had omitted the text from the previous G20 declaration referring to demand for complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine. However, even without naming Russia, it said the threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. Like Delhi, Rio did call upon all States to refrain from threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.India’s position on issues like terrorism and money laundering was also better reflected in the Delhi Declaration that addressed the issue at length, saying that terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The Rio Declaration only said the leaders condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.","For the second year in succession, the G20 declaration refrained from explicitly condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

NEW DELHI: In a move that signalled FBI's interest in Vikash Yadav but also left many here perplexed, the US probe agency appears to have intensified its efforts to get hold of the sacked R&AW operative by also issuing his ""wanted"" posters in Punjabi and Hindi.The FBI website already had the poster of Yadav, who allegedly masterminded the botched plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , under the ""wanted"" head in English. The notice left many intrigued as Yadav is not absconding, with Indian authorities informing their US counterparts that he was in jail for alleged robbery and is currently out on bail.FBI’s unusual interest in catching Yadav appears to have stemmed from rumours spread by Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun that Vikash Yadav could be located within the territories of Haryana and Punjab, sources said.Yadav has been indicted in a New York court in the Pannun murder-for-hire plot in which FBI has also arrested an Indian origin alleged drug dealer named Nikhil Gupta.Gupta was detained by Czech Republic authorities at Prague airport in June last year on the US govt’s request. He was accused of allegedly working with an undercover cop and hiring a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) informant to kill Pannun. Gupta was subsequently handed over to US authorities around the first week of Nov 2023, shortly before an indictment was filed in a New York court.While FBI’s efforts show Yadav is a top priority for US law enforcement, his arrest and subsequent extradition may not be an easy task. Indian government is likely to reiterate its demand about two pending extraditions. While one is former DEA informant David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, an operative of LeT who conducted recce for the gang that carried out 26/11 rampage in Mumbai, the other is Tahawwur Rana, also wanted in the same case.","The FBI website already had the poster of Yadav, who allegedly masterminded the botched plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Why some families are returning adopted kids in Tamil Nadu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-some-families-are-returning-adopted-kids-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/115363248.cms,"As soon as they heard from the nursing home that their surrogate had delivered a healthy baby, the adoptive parents (name withheld) informed the adoption agency of their decision to return the 8and 10-year-old siblings they had adopted a few months earlier. The children, who are now back in the adoption home, will be counselled for foster care or placement in a govt home where they may grow up as orphans.Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies for different reasons. Four parents quoted “adjustment issues” as a reason for returning children. While one parent thought the toddler did not make enough eye contact during conversation another felt the child had anger issues. Some parents quoted marital or financial problems within the family, and others cited the child’s poor health. In one case it was the death of a parent. Officials confirmed that while three of them have been re-adopted, one is in foster care and the remaining still in govt homes.The social welfare department has recorded three dissolutions of adoption in 2020, four in 2021 and five in 2023. Protocols , however, are now being implemented to ensure they don’t happen again. “We counsel parents at least twice to see if we can help them retain the child. In some cases, we know parents may not have a choice. The adoption process is then dissolved to declare the adoption void,” says social welfare secretary Jayashree Muralidharan .An authorised agency applies for dissolution to the district magistrate through the district child protection unit. Once the process is completed, the child is back on the list of those “legally free” for adoption. “Considering the long wait list, most children get another chance quickly,” says Muralidharan . “In general, most adoptions are successful. Dissolutions, however, have become unavoidable due to various reasons in some cases.”Psychiatrists say parents who surrender adopted children cannot be villainised as they are seeing a rise in “adaptive challenges” for different reasons. First, as adopted children identified with early stressful childhood, many parents seek consultations for “behaviour issues” after complaints from siblings, neighbours and schools. “It’s tough on the child as well as the parent. Until some years ago, most adoptions happened within the family. A couple who do not have children will adopt their nephews or nieces, or from families known to them. The joint family system monitored the upbringing of the adopted child,” says child psychiatrist Dr V Jayanthini.Today, information about biological parents is unknown in most cases, she says. “Mothers may not have had a happy pregnancy period. They may have neglected their diet and medical care, resulting in little bonding between the mother and the child after birth. All this can be stressful for the child. When they come to new homes the process of adapting themselves may add to this stress. While in many cases they tend to settle in with love and care, some children and parents just don’t get along.”In such cases, children show pat terns of uncooperative and defiant behaviour (disruptive disorder), or they are always angry, irritable, argumentative or defiant (oppositional defiant disorder) or may express disregard for others (conduct disorders). In some cases, children may be diagnosed with neurodevelopment disorders such as autism. “I have seen such children in my clinics. They show less interest in education, pick up habits such as use of tobacco and alcohol in early teens. Some are at risk of self-harm too,” she says.Genetics also plays a role. Studies have shown adoptees have a small but known risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, says psychiatrist Dr R Thara, vice-chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). “It is not easy for parents to return the child too. We have seen cases where they do after making several attempts to build the family,” she says.The social welfare department says it ensures all adoptive parents return the child without legal battles. “Our focus is on the child. The child should not feel unwanted or grow up in a place where he or she is not loved enough,” says Muralidharan.Every year, about 400 children are adopted from nearly 4,000 waiting at homes authorised by Child Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Tamil Nadu. “The average waiting time for parents is three to five years,” says a caretaker at an adoption home. Every resident Indian prospective adoptive parent (PAP), who intends to adopt a child must register online in the Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System by applying in a prescribed format with relevant documents. “It is an intensive process. There is a home study report to evaluate parents,” says a govt social worker.The physical and mental health conditions of the parents are evaluated as a part of the pre-adoption checklist. The govt also ensures adoptive parents are financially capable and have not been convicted in criminal cases. “There are stringent age regulations,” says the social worker. While couples must be married at least for two years, single men are allowed to adopt only boys. The age of the child allotted to a parent depends on the composite age of the parent. For instance, to adopt a child less than two years of age, the composite age of the parent must be 85 years and for children between two and four composite ages of parents must be 90 years.Parents also get to see three children before they make a choice. “They may reject children who are unhealthy or disabled. Sometimes parents feel the child does not resemble them. If they don’t choose to be shown three options, they may go behind in the waiting list,” says a social welfare official.Experts feel the state must consider introducing changes to bring down cases of dissolution. For instance, Dr Thara says it is important to screen children before giving them up for adoption. “Screening should include a detailed history such as heart disease, epilepsy and diabetes in the family so that they can be detected early and treated. A proper history of mental health conditions such as alcoholism, personality issues, and schizophrenia in the family is equally critical for the new families to be vigilant about symptoms. Disparity in educational and socio-economic status can also make the child uneasy and maladjusted,” she says. This may be difficult to do as the state may often have very little family history about abandoned or surrendered children. “So, those sent for read option must have details of the problems faced by the first adoptive parents. This is to ensure children do go through trauma again and parents know what they are going to face,” says Dr Thara.","Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies.

New Delhi: With air pollution in Delhi reaching life-threatening 'severe plus' levels, Supreme Court on Monday directed Delhi and NCR states - UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab - to strictly enforce stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and immediately take a call on measures such as closing schools for all classes, allowing govt and private employees to work from home and shutting industries.It also ordered that these restrictions would continue till further orders from the court, even if AQI drops below 401, the 'severe' category threshold.The judicial crackdown came on a day when Delhi suffered a dystopian nightmare with a thick layer of pungent smoke filling the air. The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of 'severe-plus', the worst in eight years and the second-worst on record. The 24-hour average AQI maxed out at 500 at 15 stations at 5pm and citizens were left coughing and teary-eyed even on short exposures to the toxic fumes.The bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih slammed the ""wait and watch"" approach of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in enforcing Grap measures. Noting that grade III measures were enforced 48 hours after AQI level crossed 400 level, it directed that commensurate measures must be enforced immediately after the AQI level crosses the threshold and the commission should not wait for improvement in quality of air on the basis of the met department's forecast. SC administration also issued a circular in the evening advising all, including lawyers and judges to wear masks.Pleading for closure of all classes in schools, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan brought to court's notice that Delhi govt was allowing physical classes for classes 10 and 12, and contended that same number of school buses were running on roads to ferry them. The court, thereafter, ordered, ""States should take an immediate call to stop physical classes of all standards up to class 12.""Meanwhile, UP govt told the SC that it had invoked Grap-4 measures from 8am onwards on Monday.We direct all govts of NCR to strictly implement stage 4 of Grap. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring implementations of actions required under stage 4. NCR governments and the Centre will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6 (allowing public, municipal and private offices to work on 50% strength and the rest to work from home), 7 (decision on permitting Central govt employee work from home) and 8 (closure of educational institutions, non-emergency commercial activities and plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc) of stage 4 and place the decision taken on the record before the next date,"" the bench said.The bench also directed CAQM to incorporate more stringent actions in stages 3 and 4 of Grap, and not leave its implementation to the discretion of the government or local authorities. SC said that CAQM's should be preemptive and it should not wait to enforce measures, after senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said that AQI had breached 400 in November 12 itself but Grap 3 measures were enforced after 48 hours.""From the submissions made across the bar and from minutes of the meeting dated November 13, 2024, we find that the approach adopted by the sub-committee of the commission is contrary to what is observed in paragraph three of this court's order dated October 29, 2018. The direction was to EPCA to take preemptive steps under Grap. The approach adopted by the commission seems to be that they have decided to wait for improvement of AQI and therefore implementation of stage 3 and stage 4 was delayed. This is completely a wrong approach,"" the court said.It also directed the states to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable the citizens to lodge complaints of violation of actions under stage 4 and ordered them to file an affidavit on compliance of all its directions by Thursday and posted the case for further hearing on November 22.","Air pollution in Delhi reaches life-threatening'severe plus' levels. Supreme Court on Monday directed Delhi and NCR states to strictly enforce stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of'severe-plus', the worst in eight years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115430898,imgsize-399513,width-400,resizemode-4/115430898.jpg"

GUWAHATI: Fissures in BJP's Manipur unit over CM N Biren Singh 's handling of the ongoing strife deepened Tuesday after 19 of 37 saffron party MLAs representing either side of the ethnic divide skipped the previous night's NDA meeting in which a resolution was passed to go all out against the "" Kuki militants "" suspected to have killed six Meitei inmates of a shelter for the displaced in Jiribam.Amid unconfirmed reports of the CM's secretariat serving notices on 11 NDA members, including ministers, for abstaining from the meeting, Biren Singh issued a video message pledging to ""undertake every necessary measure to safeguard people, regardless of their community"".Letters were sent Sunday to all MLAs of BJP and its allies for a meeting to decide an appropriate response to the latest cycle of violence within hours of Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma's NPP withdrawing support to the NDA govt, citing the CM's failure to resolve the crisis.NDA has a strength of 53 in the 60-member assembly. The alliance includes seven NPP MLAs, five from Naga People's Front (NPF), one of JD(U) and three Independents, one of whom is a Kuki. Seven of BJP's 37 legislators are Kukis, all of whom were absent from the meeting.

NEW DELHI: An FIR was filed on Tuesday against BJP leader Vinod Tawde amid cash-for-vote charges as the Election Commission took action based on a complaint lodged by Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA). The district authorities in Palghar said that a police team comprising senior officials recovered Rs 9.93 lakh cash and some incriminating documents from the hotel where some BJP activists were allegedly distributing money. Tawde, however, has denied the charges. He was backed by the BJP which called the charges baseless and termed the incident a desperate bid by MVA ahead of polling on Wednesday.BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the FIR was not related to cash-for-vote charge but was registered for MCC violations.The Tuling police in Nalasopara East registered FIR against BJP's Tawde under sections of the Representation of People’s Act.The action against Tawde came hours after after dramatic scene unfolded in Palghar's Nalasopara assembly constituency when workers from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi created a commotion outside a hotel where BJP national general secretary Vinod Tawde was holding a meeting. The workers, led by BVA MLA Kshitij Thakur, accused the BJP of distributing money.Meanwhile, Tawde cancelled a scheduled press conference in the evening after directives from the Election Commission (EC).Responding to the allegations, Tawde firmly denied the claims, emphasising his commitment to transparency. ""A meeting of MLAs from Nalasopara was underway to discuss the model code of conduct, sealing of voting machines, and handling objections. Appa Thakur and Kshitij misunderstood and thought we were distributing money,"" Tawde said.He called for an impartial investigation, adding, ""Let the Election Commission and Police inquire, and let them get CCTV footage. I have been in the party for 40 years. Appa Thakur and Kshitij know me, the entire party knows me. I believe the Election Commission should conduct a thorough investigation.""Talking to reporters later, Tawde said he was in Nallasopara to provide guidance regarding election procedures and not to distribute money. He further challenged opposition members to verify his activities.District collector and election officer Govind Bodke said the election department received complaints from BVA activists that some BJP workers were distributing cash at a hotel in Virar. Following this, the returning officer of Nalla Sopara and a police team, along with the joint police commissioner and two deputy police commissioners, searched the hotel and recovered Rs 9.93 lakh cash and some incriminating documents, the official said.The collector, in a recorded message, confirmed that cases were registered for offences, including possession of cash, violation of the model code of conduct, and holding illegal press conferences. The police were probing into the crimes, he said, without revealing against whom these offences were registered.Leaders of the opposition MVA demanded a comprehensive investigation by the Election Commission, with Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut suggesting a conspiracy against Tawde by some BJP leaders.Speaking to reporters,alleged that Tawde came to Virar with Rs 5 crore to influence voters. ""Some BJP leaders informed me that BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde is coming to Virar to disburse Rs 5 crore to influence voters. I thought a national leader like him would not stoop to such a trivial task. But I saw him here. I urge the Election Commission to take action against him and the BJP. The hotel’s CCTV recording was initially deactivated, showing complicity,"" Thakur claimed.The BVA legislator alleged the hotel Tawde was staying had shut CCTV recording. ""The hotel administration seems to be in cahoots with Tawde and the BJP. They only activated their CCTV after we requested it. Tawde was distributing money to manipulate voters,"" he said.A purported video of the altercation between Tawde and BVA leaders has surfaced on social media, fueling the controversy.also weighed in, saying, ""The BJP's scheme has come to an end. Thakur has done what the Election Commission should have done. EC officials search our bags and scrutinise us, yet these individuals from the BJP face no such checks.""Raut further said, ""No matter how much the BJP tries to hide, whatever happened in Nallasopara-Virar, it happened before the camera."" He also pointed out Tawde's substantial cash reserves, alleging he has the names of 18 people who disburse money with police escorts.He expressed concern over the implications of Tawde being caught, claiming that prominent BJP leaders, including state home minister Devendra Fadnavis, were aware of his activities.Raut said if the Election Commission had been unbiased, its officials would have conducted raids.alleged that Tawde distributed money to voters in Palghar district.added, ""Vinod Tawde should get a PhD, he is being hailed (sarcastically) for dismantling governments in few states, and forming BJP governments in few states, what is the real reason? This is BJP's 'note jihad', it is like distributing money and winning. Now we have to see what election commission does? It should not be done away by putting a case, there should be an action.""Calling for an action by the Election Commission of India against Tawde, Thackeray further said, ""Based on the evidence, action should be taken. Otherwise, Maharashtra will take action on its own.""“In one of the videos, the person prominently seen wearing saffron attire is BJP National General Secretary Vinod Tawde, from whom a large sum of money has reportedly been recovered,” said. “He was caught in the Virar East area with a black bag containing Rs 5 crore in cash and a diary listing details of Rs 15 crore. This raises serious questions, especially ahead of the elections.”Election Commission officials conducted a raid at the Virar hotel where Tawde was holding a meeting.said, “There are videos showing loads of cash, probably amounting to Rs 5 crore. A diary found at the scene names those who received the money. This is a blatant attempt to buy votes. The EC must act immediately to ensure a free and fair election.”Chaturvedi further alleged, “Truckloads of money from Gujarat and Delhi entered Maharashtra unchecked. This raid wasn’t conducted by the EC but by the people and a rival candidate. The BJP is trying to win elections using money, undermining democratic principles.”expressed shock. “It is shocking that a national leader of such a big party is distributing money. This is very dangerous for any democracy. If people want to get elected by distributing money, what should people like us do? Is there morality in this country or not? I publicly condemn this act, and it should be investigated,” she said.demanded arrests. “Whenever money is recovered in Maharashtra, it often links back to the BJP. If this is proved, Vinod Tawde and his associates should be arrested. This is not just a violation of election norms but a mockery of democracy.”accused the BJP of misusing government machinery and indulging in corrupt practices, including distributing money to buy votes, fearing a defeat in the upcoming state assembly elections.Speaking to the media, Patole criticised the BJP for using money power to manipulate the electoral process, arguing that this is an attempt to win the election through corrupt means, fearing a resounding defeat.He said, ""The Election Commission must ensure a fair and transparent election process. However, the series of events over the past month, including biased actions against opposition leaders, have raised concerns. Bags of opposition leaders have been checked under suspicious circumstances, and they've been prevented from flying in helicopters or airplanes, but no such scrutiny has been applied to the ruling party.""Responding to claims that Tawde was caught with Rs 5 crore in cash at a Virar hotel,dismissed the charges as baseless. “Today in Maharashtra, Maha Vikas Aghadi is making a desperate attempt to influence the atmosphere by making absurd accusations,” said Trivedi.He explained that Tawde, who oversees the party’s operations, was in the Nalasopara area meeting candidates to discuss election preparations. “He asked them to come to a hotel on the highway for a brief discussion. In the meantime, the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi candidate came there and began raising concerns about this,” Trivedi added.Trivedi emphasized that the meeting took place in a public space and urged authorities to verify the allegations using CCTV footage. “It is clear from our side that this incident happened in a hotel and not at a private location. If Rs 5 crore was carried, there must be some visual evidence of such a huge amount being transported.”also dismissed the allegations as a ""publicity stunt."" He said, ""The MVA has already lost the game. They are destined for defeat in this election, which is why they are making such absurd allegations against us. What Thakur is doing is nothing more than a publicity stunt.""termed the accusations a “pre-planned conspiracy” by the opposition to tarnish the party’s image ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections.Bawankule rejected claims that Tawde was caught with Rs 5 crore in cash at a Virar hotel, saying, “A film was made, and media management was also done. Accusations were made that Tawde came to distribute crores. Vinod Tawde is the party’s national general secretary. One needs to think if a man in such a position will go around distributing money.”He further alleged that the opposition, aware of its imminent defeat, orchestrated the incident to defame the BJP and its leadership.The incident comes as Maharashtra heads into the final stages of its high-stakes Assembly elections. With campaigning wrapped up on Monday, voting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20, followed by counting on November 23.The polls will decide the fate of the 288-seat Maharashtra Assembly, with the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) locked in a fierce battle.

GANDHINAGAR: The Centre will strive to ensure that all undertrials who have served one-third of the maximum sentence for the offence they are charged with receive justice before Constitution Day is celebrated, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday. The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.Shah said, ""We have put in place 60 provisions for the court, the prosecution and police to complete their work within a time limit. We have also made provision for jails so that if a trial is not going on after a certain period, then - except for non-serious crimes - the jail officer will have to present the bail process inside the court.""It is our effort that before Constitution Day, there should not be a single prisoner in the country’s jails who has served one-third of his sentence and has not yet got justice. A lot of work has gone in to make police accountable and a lot has been done to give strength to police,” Shah said at 50th All India Police Science Conference.The home minister also said India and the world face the challenges of cybercrime, infiltration, illegal use of drones, narcotics and misuse of the dark web, and India will have to take the lead in finding solutions to these challenges. He added that law enforcement agencies will have to stay a step ahead of criminals in these five areas.“These five areas will be a challenge not just for India but for the whole world,” Shah told about 250 delegates at the conference, organised by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D).He said AIPSC should work towards analysing data to bring about changes in the system to reduce crime, its investigation and speedy justice. “AIPSC needs to use AI to make data result-oriented and more effective,” Shah said.Commenting on three new criminal laws that were passed earlier this year, Shah said the home ministry made extensive preparations before implementing the three new laws. “Following their implementation, justice will be delivered to people from SC level within three years from the date of registration of a first information report (FIR),” Shah added.He said 70,000 police stations were connected to CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems), 22,000 courts through e-courts, data of 2 crore prisoners is stored in e-prisons system and that of over 1.5 crore prosecution in e-prosecution system, more than 23 lakh forensic data in e-forensic, among other things.","The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.

Videos that went viral showed Rs 500 notes being displayed by BVA workers who had surrounded a seated Tawde.Tawde (61) said he had merely stopped at the hotel while returning from Wada in Palghar district. He denied knowledge of the cash, describing his visit as a friendly one where election preparedness was discussed. He said he was explaining poll protocol to workers and demanded a probe by the EC. The opposition MVA demanded strict action against Tawde.BVA workers detained Tawde for over three hours before he was taken out by Hitendra and Kshitij Thakur themselves. Election officials later seized Rs 9,93,500 from a room on the fourth floor of the hotel.Four FIRs were filed in the matter by the local Tulinj police under the Representation of Peoples Act, confirmed Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar commissioner Madhukar Pandey. The EC filed a case against Tawde and Hitendra Thakur for holding a presser during the post-campaign silence period and another against Tawde for entering the constituency 48 hours before polling. A third FIR, against Tawde, BJP's Nalasopara candidate Rajan Naik and three others, was over seizure of cash, and the fourth one was registered against Kshitij Thakur for allegedly assaulting hotel owner Sudesh Choudhary, who is a Shiv Sena functionary and former BVA corporator. Tawde was accompanied by Naik and Choudhary.Police also issued a notice barring Tawde from entering the constituency until counting concludes on November 23.Hitendra Thakur claimed BVA received a tip-off of Tawde arriving with Rs 5 crore cash from a BJP leader. Tawde accused him of ""lying"" that a BJP neta had tipped them off.BVA members alleged the hotel's main gate was closed and CCTV cameras initially switched off; they were only activated at their insistence, they alleged. Palghar district collector Govind Bodke said they have sought video footage.Hitendra Thakur questioned Tawde's presence in Virar. The situation, BVA activists said, intensified when women in saris were found seated on the staircase leading to the fourth floor, with faces covered when questioned about their presence. Thakur alleged Tawde requested his help via phone to escape the crowd. A press address by Thakur and Tawde after the drama ended as it was halted by poll officials, with Tawde eventually departing in Thakur's vehicle.Tawde later said in statement, ""The entire sequence of events is captured on CCTV. I was only there to have tea with BJP workers and engage in discussions. The question of distributing money does not arise. CCTV footage related to this should be examined to clarify the situation.

I am glad to note that on the ground, the implementation of that understanding has proceeded as planned,” said Jaishankar in the meeting with Wang. Interestingly, Jaishankar did not use the word agreement that Indian officials had used earlier while describing the LAC patrolling arrangements leading to disengagement. China has also not used the word agreement so far but has called it a resolution.While talking about the importance of the resumption of ties following the ""successful"" Kazan meeting for not just the people of India and China but also the Global South, Wang called for sending more “positive signals” like facilitating visas as soon as possible, enhancing trust and nursing “less suspicion”. The Chinese foreign ministry said separately that the relationship is now at a new starting point.The Indian government also said the ministers recognized that the disengagement in border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity which India sees as essential for normalisation of the relationship. Both sides agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives on the Boundary Question and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon.“The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps,’’ said the Indian government.According to the Indian government, Jaishankar told Wang that India is strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia, as he noted the contributions by both India and China to BRICS and G20 formats and in shaping their eventual outcomes. “Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance,’’ said the Indian minister, adding India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations amid concerns in Beijing about India’s growing ties with the US.On the global situation and international issues, Jaishankar noted that India and China have both differences and convergences, while underlining constructive cooperation in not just Brics and the SCO framework but also G20. The Chinese readout quoted Jaishankar as saying consensus between India and China far outweighs the differences and that the 2 sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic perspective.“The two sides should implement the important consensus reached by the leaders, respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, and properly handle differences with sincerity and good faith, so as to push the bilateral relations back to the track of stable and healthy development as soon as possible,"" said Wang.","India and China focused on taking the next steps in normalising Sino-Indian ties.

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) Member of Parliament Supriya Sule has submitted a cybercrime complaint to the Election Commission of India , after being accused of using bitcoin to finance the current Maharashtra Assembly elections . The complaint targets Gaurav Mehta and former Indian Police Service officer from Pune, Ravindranath Patil.""Familiar tactics of spreading false information to manipulate the righteous voters are being resorted to, a night before the polling day. We have filed a criminal complaint to the Hon’ble ECI & the Cyber crime department against the fake allegations made of bitcoin misappropriation ,"" she said.""The intent and mala fide actors behind it are amply evident, condemn worthy that such practices are taking place in a healthy democracy guided by the Constitution of India,"" added Sule while posting a copy of the complaint letter addressed to EC on social media.As the claims on bitcoin misuse went public, BJP also held a press conference demanding answers from the MVA. In a press conference, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""An accused dealer contacts a former police officer who has been jailed earlier due to some allegations and tells him that he (the alleged dealer) wants to do some transactions of bitcoin in cash. The police officer declines his request. But the dealer tries to convince him as few 'big people' are involved in this matter and he allegedly takes the names of Nana Patole and Supriya Sule. When the police officer doesn't show any trust in this, the dealer sends him the audio clips. As per the claims of the dealer, there is mention of the need for money for the elections in those audio clips.""Then, he directly called out Congress saying, ""Now, we want to ask 5 questions to the Congress Party, one, are you involved in the bitcoin transaction? Second, are you in contact with this person named Gaurav Gupta or Mehta? Third, the chats are yours (of your leaders) or not? Fourth, the audio in the audio clips is yours or not? Fifth, who are the 'big people'?""This comes as former Pune IPS officer from Ravindranath Patil, levelled the accusations against Supriya Sule and Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole, claiming they misused bitcoins from a 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case to finance the current Maharashtra Assembly Elections. Patil indicates his willingness to assist with investigations.In his statement to ANI, Patil implicated Amitabh Gupta , former Police Commissioner of Pune, and Bhagyashri Nautake, former Deputy Commissioner handling Cyber Crime Investigations, in the alleged bitcoin misappropriation scheme benefiting the political leaders. According to Patil, the cryptocurrency funds were utilised during the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra.""My company called me as a cryptocurrency expert to investigate a case in 2018. I was arrested in that case in 2022 under allegations of fraud. I spent 14 months in jail after a trial. During that time, I was wondering what had happened, what the case was and why was I trapped. There were other colleagues also with me. We were working on finding out the truth. A witness against us, Gaurav Mehta, who is an employee of an audit firm named Sarathi Associates. A day before yesterday, he called me multiple times for 4-5 hours, but I did not respond.""He then further added, ""Finally, when I responded, he told me that in 2018, when Amit Bharadwaj was arrested, he had a cryptocurrency hardware wallet... That wallet was replaced by the then Commissioner Amitabh Gupta and another wallet was kept. We were arrested but the real perpetrators were Amitabh Gupta and his team. He (Gaurav Mehta) took the names of two IPS officers, Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake. He took two people's name one is Supriya Sule and Nana Patole. He then told me that in this assembly elections bitcoins are being used.""Patil further revealed that he possesses voice recordings from Gaurav Mehta and said, ""Supriya Sule has sent three voice note messages in which she is heard asking Gaurav to encash bitcoins as the funds are needed for the elections. She is also heard assuring him not to worry about the inquiries and one they come to power, they will handle them.""""He (Gaurav Mehta) further said that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections too, the same bitcoin money is being used. On the direction of Amitabh Gupta, he (Gaurav Mehta) went to Dubai multiple times and converted the bitcoin into cash. And that cash is being used in Maharashtra elections... He (Gaurav Mehta) sent me some voice notes he had received on WhatsApp. There were 3 audio messages from Supriya Sule where she asks for cash in exchange for bitcoins. She also says that he (Gaurav Mehta) does not need to worry about inquiry, they will handle it when they come to power... He (Gaurav Mehta) sent another voice note between Amitabh Gupta and Nana Patole where Patole is asking why there is a delay in cash.""Patil additionally claims that recordings exist of ""Amitabh Gupta giving instructions to Gaurav to cash out bitcoins."" ""He (Gaurav) sent me more recordings where Amitabh Gupta was asking for Rs. 50 crores... He sent me a voice note he sent to Amitabh Gupta, saying that they had made 4 crypto wallets under the names of Patil and Ghode (my colleague) and the transactions were done from these wallets. If there is an investigation, Patil and Ghode would be caught... During the chat with me, he (Gaurav Mehta) alleged that he wanted to come out of this but his life would be in danger... I have all the screenshots and the audio and I am ready to provide them to the investigation agencies. I am ready to support the investigation.""Patil received this information from a whistle-blower who participated in investigating the 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case. He asserts that Gaurav Mehta currently controls misappropriated bitcoins worth hundreds of crores of rupees. ""He said that they have already sold bitcoins worth Rs. 150 crores and they have several 100 crores more...

Maharashtra votes for 288 seats in single phase: What's at stake?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-assembly-elections-votes-for-288-seats-in-single-phase-whats-at-stake/articleshow/115457717.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: All 288 seats in Maharashtra are set to vote for assembly elections on Wednesday in a single phase. Along with Maharashtra, Jharkhand will also vote for 38 seats in the second and final phase.In Maharashtra, it's a high-stakes battle for the two major alliances, Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti which is currently in power, and Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA).Since 2019, when the last assembly was held, the state has seen two major splits with Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde splitting Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena respectively. This election will therefore see a blockbuster contest of Sena vs Sena and Pawar vs Pawar where the parties fight for popular mandate and legacy.The incumbent BJP-led Mahayuti alliance seeks to maintain their control, whilst the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition aims to regain power in the state. The electoral contest features 4,136 candidates, including 2,086 independents. In Mahayuti, the BJP is competing in 149 constituencies, Shiv Sena in 81, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP has nominated candidates for 59 seats.On the other hand in MVA, Congress has nominated 101 candidates, whilst Shiv Sena (UBT) has 95 contestants, and NCP (SP) is represented by 86 candidates. Meanwhile, the Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded 237 candidates, whilst the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) is contesting in 17 constituencies of the 288-member assembly.The two Pawars, Shinde and Thackeray are locked in a fierce contest for political legitimacy. The outcome of the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly election, scheduled for announcement on November 23, could potentially end the political careers of two contestants.Sharad Pawar, approaching his 84th birthday, seeks to deliver another decisive victory against his nephew's faction, which the Election Commission recognised as the legitimate Nationalist Congress Party. Ajit Pawar, following his setback in the Lok Sabha elections, aims for a comeback.The Lok Sabha results provided encouragement to both Thackeray, leading Shiv Sena (UBT), and chief minister Shinde, whose group received recognition as the authentic Shiv Sena. The assembly election now stands as a decisive contest.The performance of these four regional leaders will influence the political strategies of national parties.The factional rivalry intensifies with Shiv Sena claimants competing in over 51 constituencies, whilst Pawar faction candidates face off in approximately 36 seats.Party workers reference ""Mumbai ka king kaun"", highlighting the contest for dominance over Mumbai, previously controlled by the unified Shiv Sena.Western Maharashtra witnesses the most intense uncle-nephew competition, particularly in the Pawar family's stronghold.Sharad Pawar, having served four terms as chief minister, calls for defeating 'betrayers', targeting Ajit Pawar's group. The nephew maintains restraint in his rhetoric, mindful of public sympathy towards his uncle following the Lok Sabha results.NCP (SP) secured eight Lok Sabha seats compared to NCP's one, whilst Shiv Sena (UBT) won nine seats against Sena's seven.Campaign narratives ranged from opposition's focus on economic challenges and alleged discrimination to the ruling alliance's emphasis on welfare programmes and Hindutva agenda.The Saturday results will determine both popular support for competing agendas and the political survival of Maharashtra's key political figures.","All 288 seats in Maharashtra are set to vote for assembly elections on Wednesday.

Data from US consulate-general, Hyderabad, show that nearly 56% of Indian students who packed their bags for the US last year were from the two states - with 34% from Telangana and 22% from Andhra.The number of US students enrolled in Indian institutions increased 300% over the previous year.These details were shared by Hyderabad's US consular chief Rebekah Drame and public affairs officer Alexander McLaren during a visit to Visakhapatnam Tuesday. Although they did not divulge the exact number of students from Telangana and Andhra, it could be around 1.8 lakh as India sent nearly 3.3 lakh students to the US in 2023.""The demand for visas in India is insatiable. Last year we processed 1.4 million visas. While this represents just a tenth of a percent of the population, it is still an impressive number. No other country (consulate) operating in India has processed as many visas,"" Drame said.The consular chief added: ""Over the past year and a half, our staff in Hyderabad more than doubled. By early 2025, we expect the team to nearly triple in size. Currently, we process about 1,600 visas per day, and this number is likely to increase to around 2,500 by Jan or Feb next year- potentially even more after that...""The Hyderabad consulate conducted over 47,000 student visa interviews during the 2024 summer student visa season, up from 35,000 in 2023.Public affairs officer McLaren cited the US's Open Doors report released Monday highlighting the surge in numbers of Indian students. ""This year India ranked as the number one country sending students to the US. Most Indian students are men pursuing master's degrees. Expanding enrolments in undergraduate programmes could help diversify the student body,"" said McLaren.Drame flagged other visa measures. ""One remarkable pilot programme was H-1B domestic revalidation initiative. For three months, 10,000 appointments were made available for H-1B holders residing in the US, allowing them to renew their visas without travelling back to India. This was successful and we are confident Washington will reinstate it as a regular programme next year,"" he added.",Nearly 56% of Indian students who packed their bags for the US last year were from the two states. 34% from Telangana and 22% from Andhra.

Tawde denies any wrongdoing, BJP alleges conspiracy



NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi after senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde was caught in ""cash-for-votes"" row on the eve of Maharashtra assembly elections. An FIR has been lodged against Tawde after Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) chief Hitendra Thakur accused the BJP national general secretary of distributing money to voters in Palghar.Rahul reacted sharply to the controversy and used it to continue with his digs at PM Modi's ""ek hain to safe hain"" poll pitch. ""Modiji, from whose 'SAFE' did these 5 crores come? Who looted the public's money and sent you in the tempo?"" the Congress leader posted on X.The Congress leader had on Monday mocked PM's 'Ek hai toh safe hai' poll pitch and claimed there was a link between the slogan and the Dharavi redevelopment project being given to the Adani Group.Rahul had brought a metal safe at the press conference and pulled out two posters from it. One poster featured a picture of industrialist Gautam Adani and PM Modi with the caption ""Ek hai toh Safe hai,"" and another showed a map of the project.The ""Ek hai toh safe hai"" slogan primarily serves to help Adani acquire Rs one lakh crore worth of land through the Dharavi redevelopment project, he had alleged.Tawde responded to Congress leader's jab and invited him to Nalasopara to check the CCTV footage himself and prove the allegation ""cash-for-votes"".Taking to X, Tawde said, ""Rahul Gandhi ji, you yourself come to Nalasopara, see the CCTV footage of the hotel, see the entire proceedings of the Election Commission held there and prove that the money came in this manner.""""If making such a statement without any information isn't childishness then what is?"" he added.Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray also took a ""note jihad"" jibe at BJP and demanded strict action by the Election Commission.Uddhav said that merely merely registering a case against Tawde won't suffice.""Is this BJP's note jihad (for votes)? 'Baatenge aur jitenge' (will distribute cash to win). Entire Maharashtra has seen it (a video showing bundles of cash). Maharashtra will decide tomorrow,"" Thackeray told reporters, taking a swipe at the 'Batenge toh Katenge' (divided we fall) slogan raised by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and ""vote Jihad"" claims.""Tawde was lauded for toppling governments in some states and helping to form new ones. Now the secret behind this has come out in the open,"" he added.Meanwhile, Tawde vehemently denied any wrongdoings and said that ""everything is on the record in full public and media view plus the CCTV cameras of the hotel"". The BJP claimed that allegations against its senior leader were baseless and alleged a conspiracy by a ""desperate"" opposition ahead of tomorrow's voting.""A meeting of MLAs of Nalasopara was underway. I went there to tell them about the Model Code of Conduct for the day of voting, how will voting machines be sealed, and how to go about if an objection has to be made. The workers of the party (Bahujan Vikas Aghadi), Appa Thakur and Kshitij thought that we were distributing money. Let the Election Commission and Police inquire, let them get CCTV footage. I have been in the party for 40 years. Appa Thakur and Kshitij know me, and the entire party knows me. Still, I believe that the Election Commission should conduct an impartial investigation,"" Tawde said.BJP MP and national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi came out in Tawde's support and termed the allegations baseless. ""Vinod Tawde is our national secretary and is looking after several functions of the party ... The candidate of the (Nalasopara) constituency asked him to attend the meeting. He was passing from nearby, so he agreed. Such meetings are done to instruct the party workers regarding the polling process. We insist that the CCTV of the hotel and the nearby areas be checked... Rs. 5 crores cannot be brought in a pocket. It would be visible if someone were carrying it... They should show proof and not make baseless allegations,"" he said.","Vinod Tawde is accused of distributing money to voters in Palghar, Maharashtra.

Agnipath shadow over Army chief's visit to Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-shadow-over-army-chiefs-visit-to-nepal/articleshow/115428469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week to reinforce the deep-rooted bilateral military ties, which have come under a cloud after Kathmandu refused to allow its youth to join the Indian armed forces under the Agnipath scheme , even as China assiduously continues to make deep strategic inroads into the landlocked Himalayan country.Gen Dwivedi, during his visit from Nov 20 to 24, will focus on further cranking up the long-standing close military collaboration between the two armies, ranging from combat exercises and training programmes to modernization and capacity-building.This year alone, for instance, over 300 Nepal Army personnel have been trained in Indian military establishments, while New Delhi has also been supporting Kathmandu in its military modernization by supplying hardware and software, including small arms, vehicles, and advanced training simulators.The scope and complexity of the annual Surya Kiran joint military exercise, the 18th edition of which will be held in Nepal next month, is also being expanded to enhance the interoperability and synergy between the two armies.Gen Dwivedi will also be conferred with the honorary rank of General of Nepal Army during the visit, as per a long-standing tradition. The elephant in the room, however, will be the intractable differences over the recruitment of soldiers for just four years, without pension or ex-servicemen benefits, under the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022.“Taking the Covid-19 pandemic also into account, Nepal-domicile Gorkhas have not been recruited into the Indian Army, including the seven illustrious regiments of the Gorkha Rifles, for almost five years now. This does not augur well for bilateral relations. The two govts must work out a mutually acceptable solution,” a senior officer told TOI.This becomes especially important given China’s fast-expanding arc of influence in Nepal, which has also hopped onto the former’s Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli is slated to head for China early next month on his first bilateral foreign visit, in yet another break from long-standing tradition of visiting India first.It was in 1947 that the Indian Army began recruiting Nepalese Gorkhas under the Tripartite Agreement signed with Nepal and the UK. There are currently around 30,000 Nepali citizens serving in the Indian Army, with another 90,000 ex-servicemen also drawing their pensions from the force.The Gorkha Rifles are now trying to step-up recruitment of Indian-domicile Gorkhas from Darjeeling, Dehradun, Dharamshala and other places, who are supposed to constitute 40% of the troops, as well as some Garhwalis and Kumaonis but are finding it extremely difficult to meet the shortfall.“The future looks bleak. In another 10-11 years, the last of the Nepali Gorkhas will retire from our Army,” another officer said. That will end the rich legacy and strong ties that originally began when Maharaja Ranjit Singh first raised a battalion of Gorkhas to serve in his Army around 1809-1814, with the British Army following suit soon after.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week.

A senior official said the special focus on women has led to the scheme achieving 74% of the sanctioned houses being owned by women alone or jointly. ""The scheme aspires to provide 100% ownership to women in the second phase,"" the senior official said.PMAY will complete eight years on Wednesday, having been launched by PM Narendra Modi in 2016 in Agra.Importantly, Union rural development ministry is launching a fresh survey - Awas-Plus 2024 - to identify the beneficiaries for the second phase, with the provision of ""self survey"" to weed out the oft-heard grievances of households that they were left out by the surveyors. The option would involve the interested person uploading his image for ""face-based authentication"" and other credentials on the app.The survey has 10 criteria on the basis of which an aspirant would become eligible under the scheme. While govt has a ready list of 1.2 crore beneficiaries, the survey would identify remaining 80 lakh persons to complete the two crore target for the second phase from 2024-29. However, the surplus names identified would be on the list for future.The original list of beneficiaries was based on SECC 2011, after which it was updated through an ""Awas-Plus 2018"" survey.The RD ministry has directed the states to finish the surveys by November 30, and sanction housing for eligible families by December 31.

"Identify all undertrials eligible for bail, SC tells jail authorities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/identify-all-undertrials-eligible-for-bail-sc-tells-jail-authorities/articleshow/115464227.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday asked jail superintendents to identify all undertrial prisoners, including women undertrials, who have undergone incarceration for one-third or half of the maximum punishment prescribed for offences they are accused of and send their cases to concerned courts for grant of bail.A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti passed this order and said, ""We are looking at the last person who is behind the walls of prisons and whose voice we are not able to hear. We should not miss a single prisoner who is eligible for grant of bail under Section 479 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS).""""Jail superintendents must undertake a special drive to identify women undertrial prisoners, some of whom may be lodged with their young children, would be eligible for bail under Section 479,"" the bench said.After hearing amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal and NALSA counsel Rashmi Nandkumar, who placed statistics about implementation of SC's earlier orders directing expeditious release of undertrial prisoners, the bench expressed surprise over many undertrials, who are first time offenders, not being granted bail by trial courts.Section 479 provides: Those undertrial prisoners, not facing charges in heinous offences attracting a maximum punishment of life/death sentence, would be released on bail if they have served one-third of the maximum imprisonment prescribed for the offence (first time offenders) or half of the maximum period of imprisonment (for other accused undertrials). However, it provided that those facing trial in multiple cases cannot avail this liberal bail provision.SC had also in its earlier orders mandated compliance of Section 479(3), which provided, ""The superintendent of jail, where the accused person is detained, on completion of one-half or one-third of the period of incarceration, shall forthwith make an application in writing to the Court to proceed for the release of such person on bail. This is similar to Section 436A of the criminal procedure code.""As per prison statistics of 2022, out of 5,73,220 prisoners, 4.1% or 23,772 are females, of which 80% are between the age of 18-50 years.The bench also flagged another issue - an undertrial prisoner may initially be arrested for a heinous offence, but the court may frame charges for a lesser offence, which does not provide for life/death sentence as maximum punishment.The Justice Roy-led bench said the prison records may not be getting updated after framing of lesser charges by the court and their cases would not be getting recommended for grant of bail on serving of one-third or half of the maximum punishment prescribed for the lesser offence.It asked jail superintendents to verify such cases and take appropriate steps under Section 479 of BNSS.","Supreme Court asks jail superintendents to identify all undertrial prisoners, including women undertrials.

The ""mirror award"", therefore, cannot carry M S Subbulakshmi's name.The judge was passing the order on a plea moved by V Shrinivasan, grandson of Carnatic legend MS Subbulakshmi that contended that conferring the award on Krishna would amount to awarding a ""Bhakti"" prize to an atheist, considering the ""vile, vituperative, and scandalous"" attacks made by him against the late Subbulakshmi.In his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Jayachandran said: ""The best way to honour a departed soul is to respect her wish and not disrespect it,"" pointing to her desire not to institute any award in her name.

We can understand the law and order situation in Manipur. What about Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland?"" Ethnic violence has been continuing in Manipur since May last year.Nataraj said there are serious objections from tribes of these states about the sudden suspicious increase in population in some districts, as per the 2001 census, and their assemblies have passed resolutions against taking the 2001 census data as the basis for the delimitation exercise.

The govt has claimed that the proposed reforms will bring transparency in the functioning of waqf boards, which together hold land next only to the defence ministry and the railways.Notices issued to properties belonging to Christians in Kerala and farmers in Karnataka only served to put the spotlight on the arbitrary functioning of waqf bodies as well as how the changes carried out by the UPA govt in waqf tribunals have conferred vast powers on them, with little accountability.In the last monsoon session, the govt had introduced two bills - the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, in Lok Sabha on Aug 8, proposing reforms in functioning of waqf boards and their management of properties.Rijiju said the reforms were long pending and necessary as these bodies were being controlled by certain Muslim elites while the poor and a large population from the community were deprived of their benefits.","Waqf amendment bill will be passed in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament, says Kiren Rijiju.

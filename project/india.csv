LIVE: Trump FIRES At Europe, India, China; Announces SHOCK Reciprocal Tariffs On 'Liberation Day'

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Prime Minister Modi his 'great friend' while imposing his ambitious retaliatory tariff on India.Trump said Washington would impose ""discounted reciprocal tariffs "" of 26 per cent on New Delhi.""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right.' They charge us 52 per cent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing, for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, we started with China and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs,"" Trump said holding the chart that mentioned list of countries and tariff charges.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington, D.C., in February, less than a month after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term in the White House.Trump has previously referred to India as the "" tariff king "" and a ""big abuser"" in global trade . During a joint press conference with Modi at the White House on February 13, Trump remarked that India had ""been very strong on tariffs,"" adding, ""I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.""Highlighting the US trade deficit with India, which he estimated at nearly $100 billion, Trump stated that he and Modi had agreed to begin negotiations to correct ""long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years – but they didn't do that."" The goal, he said, was to ""sign an agreement"" that would create ""a level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard.""While announcing the new tariffs, Trump defended the move by saying the US had been ""very kind"" to trading partners and would now charge them ""approximately half of the levies they impose on US goods.""","US President Donald Trump announced a retaliatory tariff of 26 per cent on India.

Indian student awarded Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship for women in nuclear science,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-student-awarded-marie-sklodowska-curie-fellowship-for-women-in-nuclear-science/articleshow/119923675.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hemangi Shrivastava, an Indian student pursuing her master’s degree in electronics and nano electronics at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI), has been awarded the prestigious Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme for women in nuclear science . MPEI is one of the flagship institutions under Russian Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom 's core and partner university network.Hemangi chose to specialise in illumination engineering and sources of light, an area she describes as the “perfect blend of science and art”. “It’s not directly related to nuclear science but is highly affected by nuclear energy. The cheaper and easier the access is to electricity in a country, the more illuminated its streets are,” Hemangi said.Speaking about her main motivation for applying to the MSCF programme, she said in 2023, she attended World Youth Festival in Sirius, Russia, organised by Rosatom, where “a very inspiring female Turkish professor explained how nuclear energy is in everything, a part of everything, even in light”.The MSCF programme, supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was launched in 2020 to encourage more women to enter and thrive in the nuclear sector. The programme supports talented students pursuing nuclear-related studies at the master's level year; one hundred and more young women scientists from all over the world become its fellows. Since the programme was launched, 560 students from 121 countries have been selected from over 2,200 applications.Rosatom, which is the largest producer of low-carbon electricity in Russia and generating approximately 20% of the nation's power, has been a key partner of IAEA's MSCF programme, supporting around 40 female students from 17 countries over the past four years. This academic year, 12 students from their flagship universities across 10 countries, including Armenia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe, received the scholarship, which covers tuition, internships, a monthly stipend and additional financial support from Rosatom.“We attach great importance to the fact that our values coincide with those of IAEA, and we can work together to ensure that there are more bright and talented women in the nuclear sector who contribute to the development of nuclear technologies and increase trust to green nuclear energy,” Vera Upirova, senior manager of Project Office for Education Development and International Cooperation of Rosatom, said.","Hemangi Shrivastava, an Indian student pursuing her master’s degree in electronics and nano electronics at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI), has been awarded the prestigious Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme for women in nuclear science.

Average adoption waiting period climbs to 3.5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/average-adoption-waiting-period-climbs-to-3-5-years/articleshow/119923009.cms,"NEW DELHI: Eager to embrace parenthood after she suffered a miscarriage, Moumita Das and her husband, in their 30s, from West Bengal registered with Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Sept 2021 to adopt a child. It is 2025 and the couple, though has slowly moved up the waiting list, is still anxiously awaiting its turn to be matched with a child in the 0-2 years age group.Even as the number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2024-25, as of March 31, the highest in 11 years, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge, with an average three and a half years waiting period for those seeking infants or young children. Most parents want to adopt a child in the 0-2 years age group.Swarnamala Arunachalam and her husband Prasanna Sukumar from Chennai, also in their 30s, have been in the queue since Dec 2021. They too are still waiting to be matched with siblings in the age group. The couple chose to go for adoption of siblings over having biological children right from the time they got married. They registered with Cara on their second anniversary but the long wait has left the couple anxious. They hope for a referral this year.With the years rolling by and many more processes to clear after being matched with a child, PAPs to whom TOI spoke to define their mental state as one where it seems like a ""race against time"" with age catching up and uncertainty growing.The numbers reflect the distress. Data, as of March 31, on the Cara dashboard, showed that there are over 35,500 PAPs across various categories registered to adopt while the number of children available for adoption is around 2,400 - 943 of these children are ""normal"" and the rest classified as ""special needs children"".Taking note of the long wait, the department-related parliamentary standing committee on education, women, children, youth and sports, chaired by Congress MP Digvjaya Singh, in its report tabled in Parliament has strongly called for measures, asking the govt to revisit the current protocols for family placement of orphan, abandoned and surrendered children (OAS).It has also asked the govt to review the existing dual system of adoption laws through Cara and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act to plug loopholes.The women and child development ministry has informed the committee that while the adoption procedure has been streamlined under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, with the online application system (Carings), the ministry has come across grievances mostly due to long waiting list of PAPs. ""...Parents want to adopt younger children only, thus leaving behind a large number of older children,"" the ministry said.The WCD ministry has also shared that based on the availability of the registered children and registered PAPs ratio, an average of three and a half years is the waiting period for infants and young children.","The number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2024-25, as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will open their home account at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium tonight (April 2) against Gujarat Titans ( GT ).Though the Women’s Premier League (WPL) wrapped up three weeks ago, the ongoing heat and dryness have left the pitches looking browner than usual.RCB, coming off two consecutive wins to start the season, won’t mind this. Such a start has only occurred for the team twice before, in 2014 and 2021.In previous seasons, this notion of no home advantage could have affected RCB. However, this time may be different. Last year, they made a remarkable run to the playoffs, winning three out of their last six games at home consecutively.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL Live Score 2025 Against the raucous crowd support for RCB, GT will need to explore various combinations. Should Jos Buttler open alongside Shubman Gill to enhance their powerplay?With David Miller not retained and Rahul Tewatia not in his prime hitting form, they risk over-relying on their top order. However, their bowling attack has the potential to deliver. Prasidh Krishna returns home, having played for Karnataka, and Mohammed Siraj returns to a venue that was his IPL home for seven years.Teams haven't dealt with much dew in the last two days. Regarding the pitch, Mo Bobat, RCB's director, anticipates a “typical Bengaluru pitch” that should produce plenty of runs.Notably, the 200-run mark wasn't surpassed in any of the seven knockout matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s held here in December. The same trend was observed in the seven WPL games, where spinners managed to take advantage of the surface.Royal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal.Impact Player: Suyash SharmaGujarat Titans probably XI: Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Impact Player: Ishant SharmaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru squad: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Gujarat Titans squad: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Jos Buttler(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.Matches played: 5Royal Challengers Bengaluru won: 3Gujarat Titans won: 2Last match: Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by 9 wickets (2024)RCB have three wins out of five against GT but their record at home isn't the best.

Lok Sabha passes Waqf Bill 288-232 after marathon 12-hour debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ls-passes-waqf-bill-288-232-after-marathon-12-hr-debate/articleshow/119918879.cms,"Kiren Rijiju: Bill has nothing to do with religion, just properties

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill after fierce discussion for over 12 hours with the govt countering the opposition's charges of encroachment on constitutional and Muslim rights and attacks on federalism with a strong defence of the changes in the Act governing Islamic endowments.The bill was adopted by 288 votes in favour and 232 against, thanks to support from BJP's 'secular' allies, which helped more than bridge the gap between the party's own numbers and the majority mark. BJP, in any case, was always confident of prevailing in the contest and its confidence came through clearly in home minister Amit Shah's feisty ""you carried out the changes only to keep your vote bank intact, and we have decided to cancel it"" declaration.The bill is expected to comfortably clear the numbers test in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. Although the debate in LS followed the by-now familiar 'secular versus communal' trajectory, the smooth passage of the bill marked an important juncture. Coming after the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was opposed on the ground of being allegedly anti-Muslim, criminalisation of triple talaq and enactment of the Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand, passage of the Waqf Bill marked the fourth instance where the BJP govt has had its way despite the combined resistance of Muslim outfits and secular parties.In fact, the latest success counts even more because it was pulled off despite BJP lacking a majority and with the support of 'secular' allies who, it seems, are confident of not ending up being losers in the bargain - something which perhaps reflects the assessment that any loss of Muslim support for them would be more than compensated by gains from the partnership with BJP.Shah's intervention came during the daylong debate that witnessed a fierce exchange between the two sides, with Congress deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi alleging that the bill was an attempt to attack the basic structure of the Constitution, defame minorities, disenfranchise them and divide society. In his opening remarks, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju rejected the allegation that the proposed law was an interference in the constitutionally guaranteed freedom in religious affairs.Rijiju said the bill had nothing to do with religion, but dealt only with properties. ""The govt is not going to interfere in any religious institution. The changes made in the waqf law by the UPA govt gave it an overriding effect over other laws, hence the new amendments were required,"" he said amid noisy opposition protests.BJP was bolstered by a show of support from its key allies TDP, JDU, Shiv Sena and LJP, while the INDIA bloc put up a united show in opposing the bill.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed that the bill was BJP's ploy for polarisation following its reverses in the Lok Sabha polls, and said it would send a wrong message to the world, denting the country's secular image. The bill would prove to be BJP's ""Waterloo"" as some of its allies might be supporting the bill but they were not happy about the development inside, he added.After most of the leading opposition leaders had spoken, Shah launched a stout defence of the bill and rejected the criticism that appointment of non-Muslims in waqf councils and boards violated the community's right to manage its own affairs.Former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said over the years, Congress only paid lip service to the cause of minorities but did nothing to empower them. He also referenced the Shah Bano case, accusing Congress of undermining legal reforms for political gains. ""When Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano, the Rajiv Gandhi govt overturned the decision for vote-bank politics. Congress had 400 seats then but never got a majority after that. Today, they continue to oppose necessary reforms for political reasons,"" he said.Along with the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Rijiju also moved the Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, which was passed in the Lok Sabha.","Lok Sabha passes the Waqf (Amendment) Bill after fierce discussion for over 12 hours.

TDP's Krishna Prasad Tenneti said that it was because of his party that the JPC agreed that the proposed changes would come into effect prospectiely. ""The YRSCP representative only attended only 18 of the 38 meetings of JPC,"" Tennety emphasised, while recalling steps taken by AP CM N Chandrababu Naidu-declaring Urdu the second language in the state, construction of a Haj House among others.Speaking for JDU, Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" dismissed the ""anti-Muslim"" charge against PM Narendra Modi and said that the the bill would help the OBC Muslims, the Pasmandas.""Pasmandas will stand with Modi in the coming days as they received justice under his govt,"" he said, adding that the opposition may not like the PM but people do.The former JDU president also slammed the criticism of his party's principal figure and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and attempts to question his secularism for the regional party's support to the bill.He said nobody has done as much for Muslims in Bihar as Kumar did in his nearly 20 years of tenure, be it boosting their education, ensuring justice in the Bhagalpur riot cases and delineating their graveyards. ""The Janata Dal (United) and Nitish Kumar do not need your certificate of secularism. Your secularism is about dividing the society for votes,"" he said, targeting opposition parties.Participating in the debate, LJP (Ram Vilas) MP Arun Bharti said the bill is aimed at transparency and accountability.

Challenges and reforms in Waqf board management

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday saw a heated debate as Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government and the opposition clashed over the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, tabled by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju. Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi criticised the proposed changes, calling them an attack on the Constitution’s basic structure. He accused the government of diluting constitutional safeguards, defaming minorities, and dividing society.Defending the amendments, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted they were necessary to prevent misuse and illegal occupation. He claimed many Waqf lands were vacant or being looted, requiring government intervention for regulation.Waqf refers to assets set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law, with any other use or sale of the property being forbidden.The Waqf properties in India constitute a vast network of religious, commercial, and agricultural assets. According to the Waqf Assets Management System of India, the country has 8,72,324 immovable Waqf properties, making it one of the largest repositories of religious and community-owned land in the world.Graveyards account for 1,50,516 properties (17%), while mosques make up 1,19,200 properties (14%). Commercial establishments such as shops (1,13,187) and houses (92,505) play an economic role, while agricultural land comprises 1,40,784 properties (16%). Religious sites like dargahs and mazars total 33,492 properties.The proposed amendments introduce stricter criteria for Waqf declarations. Only practising Muslims for at least five years can dedicate property to Waqf, reverting to pre-2013 rules. Women must receive their rightful inheritance before any Waqf declaration, with provisions to safeguard widows, divorced women, and orphans.The Waqf Board has digitised 330,000 records to improve transparency, but several challenges persist. Concerns have been raised over governance, mismanagement, and legal disputes surrounding Waqf properties.One major issue is the irrevocable nature of Waqf properties, leading to prolonged legal battles. Courts have questioned claims over lands, such as two islands in Bet Dwarka, highlighting ambiguities in ownership. Encroachments, fraudulent registrations, and a lack of coordination with revenue authorities further complicate matters.There is also criticism of the Waqf Act, 1995, particularly regarding the lack of judicial oversight. Tribunal decisions cannot be challenged in higher courts, raising concerns about accountability. Additionally, delays in property surveys—especially in states like Gujarat and Uttarakhand—have hindered effective management.Cases of misuse have also surfaced, with Section 40 of the Waqf Act allegedly used to claim properties without due process. This has led to disputes and unrest in communities. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, an entire village was controversially claimed as Waqf land, leaving residents struggling to assert ownership.To address these issues, the Ministry of Minority Affairs has initiated reforms, consulting stakeholders and examining international practices in countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Key proposals include restructuring tribunals, improving property registration processes, and enforcing stricter accountability measures for Waqf Boards and Mutawallis.","India has a staggering 8,72,324 Waqf properties spread across different states and union territories.

NEW DELHI: The central government tabled the Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday amid strong resistance from the opposition.While the BJP-led government claims that the bill would improve the administration and management of Waqf properties in the country, the opposition has termed it a ""targeted legislation"" and ""fundamentally against the Constitutional provisions.""BJP's allies -- TDP and JDU -- have offered their support to the bill, with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led JDU urging the legislation's implementation not be retroactive.The name of the two bills are- Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024.

PM Modi fulfills Lalu Yadav's wish on strict Waqf law: Amit Shah

INDI alliance pushback

Government defends the bill

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah invoked an old statement by RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav while defending the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 in the Lok Sabha. Shah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had fulfilled Yadav’s 2013 demand for stricter laws to prevent misuse of Waqf properties .""When amendments to the Waqf were introduced in 2013, Lalu Yadav said he wanted a strict law and wanted to put those in jail who were stealing. PM Narendra Modi has fulfilled his wishes,"" Shah remarked during the debate on the bill, which has triggered strong opposition from the RJD and other INDI alliance members.Shah also accused the Congress of ""committing the sin"" in 2013 by barring those whose land was taken for Waqf from seeking legal recourse.""If land is purchased for a temple, the collector verifies its ownership. So why object to the collector determining whether Waqf land belongs to the government?"" he questioned.Shah further said, ""Temples, churches, and gurdwaras have been built, but not on government land. Where Waqf is declared, only the collector has the authority to decide if the land is state-owned.""As opposition parties resisted the bill, an old video of Yadav from May 7, 2010, resurfaced, showing him voicing concerns over alleged land encroachments linked to the Waqf Board. In the clip, Yadav is heard saying, ""Look, there should be a very strict law. All the land has been grabbed—whether government land, private land, or that of workers. Prime land near Patna’s Dak Bungalow has been turned into apartments. Everyone has looted. Pass the amendment today, but future processes must be strict.""The video, shared by Bihar Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, has stirred political debate, with BJP leaders pointing to an apparent contradiction in RJD’s stance.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav strongly opposed the bill, calling it unconstitutional. “BJP wants to impose ‘Nagpur ka kanoon.’ We believe in ‘Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb’ and will continue to oppose this bill,” he told ANI.Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, however, urged the opposition to reconsider, highlighting Yadav’s past statements supporting stricter Waqf laws. “Some are opposing it only because Modi’s government is bringing it,” Manjhi posted on X.Union minister Kiren Rijiju, who introduced the bill, said it aims to improve transparency in Waqf property management. He argued that past amendments gave the Waqf Act undue power over other laws. ""If not for this amendment, even Parliament could have been claimed as Waqf property,"" Rijiju claimed.Amit Shah further clarified that Waqf is a charitable endowment and government properties cannot be donated.

They are a landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. For Bangladesh, as the only guardian of the ocean in the region, this could be a huge opportunity and an extension of the Chinese economy.""The statement surfaced on social media on Monday, drawing sharp reactions from political leaders across party lines in India, who dubbed these as ""shameful"" and ""provocative"".Meanwhile, on a possible meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) Summit in Bangkok, Rahman noted there were ""reasonable grounds"" to be hopeful.""There is a high possibility of the meeting,"" he said.Bangladesh has approached India for the meeting.

This bill is going to be passed by Parliament and will apply to all. The coming law will be an enactment of govt of India and every citizen will be obliged to comply with it.""In a forceful intervention which saw him alternating between dismissal of opposition's criticism as scaremongering and a staunch defence of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill as a necessity for checking corruption and arbitrariness of the waqf bureaucracy, Shah said, ""They are making misleading claims to scare Muslims so that their vote bank remains intact.""He cited provisions of the bill to argue that it was not an encroachment on the religious rights of Muslims, and pointed out that despite the opposition's claims to the contrary over amendments to the Citizenship Act, ""not a single Muslim has lost his citizenship because of CAA"". He said the bill covered waqf boards, waqf councils and waqf tribunals which were administrative bodies, and did not extend to management of mosques which would remain under Muslims.Shah criticised changes in the Waqf Act carried out by the Congress-led UPA govt in 2013 as part of the ""politics of appeasement"". He said the latest version of the Act more than doubled the area under waqf properties - from 18 lakh acres to 39 lakh acres. The home minister also pointed out that the orders of waqf tribunals were rendered immune from judicial scrutiny, with revenue courts and civil courts being divested of the power to hear appeals.""These days, it is fashionable to move around brandishing the Constitution. Can anything be more unconstitutional than putting a body above judicial scrutiny? You changed the law for politics of vote bank and we have now cancelled the changes,"" Shah said, pointedly refuting the contention of Congress's deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi who had said that appeals against orders of tribunals were not barred. ""You have tried to mislead. Civil suits, where the interests of original occupants are given precedence, were indeed barred. Only writs were allowed. You know the difference but you are obfuscating it only for the sake of vote bank politics,"" he added.Shah argued that the changes would benefit Muslim masses by bringing transparency and eliminating corruption. ""In 2013, 20,000 properties were shown as leased. Now, the latest records show there are none. What happened? Were the properties sold off?"" he asked.The minister used other tracks as well - playing up support for the bill from a host of Christian bodies, claims made by waqf bodies on lands associated with temples and churches, and provisions of the bill which stipulate that land owned by SCs/STs would not come under waqf. He also struck an assertive note with regard to other provisions, such as that a Muslim can donate only his personal wealth and assets to waqf, that is, an Islamic endowment. ""How can one donate a govt or public property to waqf?"" he asked.Shah concluded by expressing confidence that Muslims would realise the benefit of the amendments. ""In four years, even Muslim brothers will realise that this bill is actually in their benefit,"" he said.","Home minister Amit Shah says changes being carried out in the Waqf Act will be firmly enforced.

NEW DELHI: With the Telangana assembly speaker arguing that a court could not direct a speaker to decide on disqualification of MLAs who allegedly defected to another party, Supreme Court Wednesday said as a protector of the Constitution, it was not powerless to pass an order when ""mockery of the 10th Schedule "", pertaining to the anti-defection law, was being made.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih also took exception to Telangana CM Revanth Reddy 's statement in the assembly that no by-elections would take place even if BRS MLAs switched sides to Congress. Observing that a statement made in the assembly had sanctity unlike political speeches given in a public rally, the bench said if this was said on the floor of the House, then the CM was ""making a mockery of the 10th Schedule"".The court was also surprised over the submission by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the speaker, that courts could not direct and fix a timeline for deciding disqualification pleas.Rohatgi said disqualification pleas pending before a speaker were beyond judicial review. ""Judicial review is not permissible before a decision is taken by the speaker,"" he said, adding that court could just request the speaker in this case.The court, however, asked what would happen if an MLA defected after one month of election and the Speaker did not take a decision for five years and the tenure of assembly came to an end.""No direction can be passed to take a decision in a particular way but it can be directed that the decision is taken within a reasonable time.

Waqf Amendment Bill: Why Muslims are opposing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-amendment-bill-why-muslims-are-opposing-it/articleshow/119905795.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Muslim organisations and leaders strongly opposed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill tabled by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Parliament on Wednesday. They argue that the proposed changes will be detrimental rather than beneficial to the Muslim community. They claim that the Bill is an attempt to weaken the autonomy of Waqf properties and seize lands that have been historically dedicated for religious and charitable purposes.Senior members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have denounced the Bill, stating that their concerns were disregarded by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). ""The AIMPLB and other Muslim organizations have conveyed their concerns over the Bill to the JPC, but they were not considered,"" said Maulana Khalid Rashi Farangi Mahali, a senior executive member of the Board, to PTI.He emphasised that Waqf properties hold deep religious significance, comparable to fundamental Islamic practices, and that any amendment affecting their status is unacceptable. ""We have urged all MPs to consider the sentiments of the Muslim community and reject the proposed amendments,"" he added.In Bareilly, Ittihad-e-Millat Council chief Maulana Tauqeer Raza expressed outright rejection of the Bill, stating that it will not be accepted under any circumstances. ""We cannot approve any such Bill, nor can we support anything that goes beyond the constitutional framework. We will oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Bill through democratic means,"" he asserted.He also pointed out that there has not been sufficient resistance to the Bill so far and accused the government of misrepresenting the issue. ""We are accused of making illegal encroachments on Waqf properties, but our ancestors dedicated their properties to Waqf. Many rulers did the same, building temples and donating properties to them. Now, those very properties are being taken away,"" he said.Maulana Tauqeer Raza further alleged that the Bill is designed to harass Muslims and seize their lands under the guise of reform. ""How has the BJP suddenly become such a well-wisher of Muslims? This is sheer deception in the name of protecting Muslim interests,"" he remarked.Another aspect fueling the protests is the 'waqf by user' classification. The Waqf Act of 1954 classified properties under the designation of ""waqf by user"". According to this provision, a property gains waqf status if it has served religious or charitable functions over an extended period, regardless of formal paperwork. However, the suggested legislation eliminates this provision, creating uncertainty about the status of numerous such properties.Meanwhile, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi contended that the legislation targets Muslims' religious liberties. The AIMIM president further elaborated that the bill fundamentally contradicts Articles 14, 25, 26 and 29 of the Indian Constitution. He dismissed the legislation, stating that rather than being a Waqf Bill, it should be termed a ""Waqf Barbaad Bill.""Additionally, the bill mandates the inclusion of non-Muslims in the Central Waqf Council and state waqf boards, which critics argue interferes with Muslim religious affairs.Another provision allows an officer above the rank of collector to investigate government properties claimed as Waqf, with the final decision on ownership shifting from Waqf tribunals to senior government officials, which some believe will lead to political bias. Despite the widespread opposition from Muslim groups, some legal experts have defended certain provisions of the Bill. In Varanasi, lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain argued that the Bill curtails the unchecked powers of Waqf boards, calling it a ""positive step."" However, he acknowledged that certain aspects require further debate. ""There is no provision to take back the property of any other religion or trust which has been declared as Waqf property. We have registered our protest against this,"" he said.The opposition to the Bill has also been echoed in Parliament, where no bipartisan consensus has been reached. The ruling National Democratic Alliance remains firm on pushing the amendments, while opposition parties have criticized the Bill as ""unconstitutional"" and harmful to the Muslim community.The bill amendment specifies that Muslim-established trusts under any legal framework will be excluded from Waqf classification, ensuring complete authority over these entities.The bill reinstates pre-2013 regulations, stipulating that only individuals who have been practising Muslims for a minimum of five years can allocate their property to Waqf. Additionally, it mandates that women must receive their inherited share before any Waqf declarations, whilst incorporating specific provisions to safeguard the interests of widows, divorced women and orphans.",Muslim organisations and leaders strongly opposed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill tabled by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Parliament on Wednesday.

Nitish, who has been the dominant partner of the NDA in Bihar for nearly two decades, is perhaps for the first time following the politics of his now-dominant ally - the BJP.Interestingly, while the BJP, and even the opposition parties in Bihar, may make some gains from Waqf politics, Nitish Kumar's JD(U) will keep its fingers crossed - as the party had, over the years, found considerable support among the minorities in the state despite its alliance with the saffron party.Little wonder, while the BJP went all out to push the legislation as a much-needed reform to end corruption and land grab in the name of Waqf, the JD(U) leaders were on the defensive announcing their party's support to the Bill.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha had said on Tuesday highlighting his party's stand on the Waqf Amendment Bill.So, why is Nitish Kumar helping the BJP pass a Bill that many Muslims oppose?Political analyst NK Choudhary says Nitish Kumar knows exactly what he is doing. ""Polarisation is a reality in today's politics and Nitish Kumar knows that Waqf politics will make this divide stronger in Bihar. The way some opposition parties are blindly backing the Muslims on the Waqf Bill may see the fence-sitters, a lot of whom are Hindus, veering towards the NDA,"" NK Choudhary says.""Nitish may lose some Muslim votes, but that will be compensated by the gains the BJP makes so overall the NDA may in fact end up making gains in Bihar,"" he says.Another political analyst Kumar Vijay has an interesting take on Nitish Kumar's decision to back the Waqf Bill. ""Nitish Kumar backing the Waqf Bill is perhaps a well thought out strategy. Nitish is protecting the interests of his next generation (his son Nishant) and the JD(U) as a party is preparing for politics beyond Nitish Kumar,"" says Kumar Vijay.""Nitish may lose some Muslim votes, but he knows the future prospects of his party is safer with the BJP than the RJD as Tejashwi is already an established player and his son would be completely overshadowed in any possible alliance with Lalu's party,"" he says.""The BJP also stands to gain by keeping the JD(U) in its fold as caste survey has revealed that Nitish Kumar's support base in the state remains quite significant,"" he adds.Interestingly, both the analysts feel that Waqf Bill may end up helping the NDA in Bihar. Assembly elections in Bihar are still some months away. The opposition's Mahagathbandhan would go all out to corner the NDA, especially Nitish Kumar over his support to the Waqf Bill. While the BJP may not mind this opposition offensive given the potential electoral gains that may come its way, it will be interesting to see how Nitish Kumar handles the pressure in the run up to elections.","Nitish Kumar is perhaps for the first time following the politics of his now- dominant ally - the BJP.

The National Medical Commission is reviewing the disability guidelines for admission to medicine courses to shift the emphasis to whether individuals can perform the required competencies rather than what percentage of disability they have. This comes after Supreme Court directed that guidelines be reviewed to assess what such candidates can do rather than what they can't.The panel framing the guidelines has accordingly decided to rename Disability Assessment Boards as Ability Assessment Boards . The minutes of the meet framing the new guidelines submitted in court revealed it would be attempting ""to define which medical competencies are essential and non-negotiable for safe medical practice"".Over the years, several candidates with disability have successfully challenged NMC's disability guidelines, based on which they were barred from joining for an MBBS course after clearing the national entrance examination.

The routine check-up turned out to be a life-saving event, revealing she had breast cancer and underlining the importance of early detection. She said as the disease was detected early, it didn't spread to her other organs, and a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, helped her recover faster.Unfortunately, cancer specialists say, most cases of breast cancer - the most common cancer among women in India - are detected late because of lack of routine screening. A study published in BMC Public Health recently shows the extent of this crisis.Examination of the breasts using X-ray, referred to as mammography in medical terms, is an important method to detect the cancer, and doctors advise that all women aged 40 and above should undergo the screening process at least once in two years.However, according to the study, only one in every 100 women aged 45 years and above in the country undergo mammography, which is lower than the mammography rates in African countries (4.5%). In Europe and the US, the periodic mammography rate is as high as 84%.The BMC research, led by Divya Khanna and Dipak Das from Tata Memorial Centres in Varanasi and Mumbai and Priyanka Sharma from the ESIC Medical College and Hospital in Faridabad, shows the highest prevalence of mammography in India is in Kerala (4.5%), followed by Karnataka (2.9%), Lakshadweep (2.7%) and Maharashtra (2.05%). In Delhi, the mammography rate is less than 1% among women aged 45 years and above.The study is based on data collected from 35,083 women in the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India, a nationwide representative survey, to find out how many of them had undergone mammography in the past two years. It revealed that only 1.3% of women had undergone mammography.Dr. P Raghu Ram, founding director, KIMS-USHALAKSHMI Centre for Breast Diseases, Hyderabad, said the main reasons why women hesitate to undergo a screening mammogram include lack of awareness and the fear of risk from radiation exposure which is a myth since modern day mammography (Digital and 3-D Mammography) involves only a tiny amount of radiation - even less than a standard chest X-ray.","Most cases of breast cancer are detected late because of lack of routine screening. Only one in every 100 women aged 45 years and above in the country undergo mammography. In Europe and the US, the periodic mammography rate is as high as 84%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119921214,imgsize-685482,width-400,resizemode-4/119921214.jpg"

Break-up should not result in rape case: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/break-up-should-not-result-in-rape-case-supreme-court/articleshow/119919443.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after ruling that a woman who is in a live-in relationship for a long period may not be able to accuse her live-in partner of rape by compelling her to get into physical relation on the false promise of marriage, SC on Wednesday raised the issue of the rising trend of filing rape cases citing false promise of marriage.While hearing a plea of a man seeking to quash rape charges against him by a woman who was engaged to him, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Rajesh Bindal flagged the issue and said that break-up of relationship should not result in rape cases. The lady submitted she was subjected to sex on the false pretext of marriage.""If you were so gullible, you would not be before us. You were a major. It cannot be that you were hoodwinked to believe you will get married, etc. With due respect, today the concept of morality, virtues is different with younger lot. If we agree with you, then any relationship between boy and girl in college etc will become punishable,"" the bench observed.Senior advocate Madhavi Divan, appearing for the victim, said this was not a case of a romantic relationship turning sour but an arranged marriage situation. ""The consent in the present case cannot be said to be free consent... Her engagement breaking will be a social taboo . She thinks if she does not please him he may not marry her. They were engaged. It may be casual sex for him but not for the woman,"" Divan said. SC thereafter decided to examine the case in detail.","Justices M M Sundresh and Rajesh Bindal flagged the issue and said that break-up of relationship should not result in rape cases.

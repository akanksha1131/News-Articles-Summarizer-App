BJP releases alleged chat of TMC MPs' spat: 'Who is versatile international lady?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-releases-alleged-chat-of-tmc-mps-spat-who-is-versatile-international-lady/articleshow/120081928.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya on Tuesday flagged an alleged public altercation between Trinamool Congress MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad - a former cricketer - at the Election Commission headquarters on April 4. He also claimed that tensions also spilled over onto a party WhatsApp group, with a cryptic reference to a ""versatile international lady"" fuelling the drama.Taking to X, Malviya wrote that the two TMC MPs had a heated exchange at the ECI office, where they had gone to submit a memorandum. According to him, ""It appears the party had instructed its MPs to gather at the Parliament office to sign the memorandum before proceeding to the EC. However, the MP carrying the memorandum skipped the Parliament meeting and went directly to the EC.""This reportedly irked the other MP, leading to a loud verbal confrontation that required ""police intervention.""The matter, Malviya claimed, escalated to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , who instructed both MPs to stand down.However, the episode didn’t end there. Screenshots posted by Malviya, allegedly from the ‘AITC MP 2024’ WhatsApp group, show that the feud continued online, with TMC leaders taking sides and trading accusations.The alleged WhatsApp exchange between TMC MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad, shared by BJP's Amit Malviya, shows a personal turn in their growing spat. Banerjee appeared to take a veiled dig at Azad, writing:""Today I Congratulate the gentleman who opened the beautiful activities of versatile international lady. That day not a single boyfriend of her stood behind her. This foolish man whom she wanted to arrested by BSF, stood behind her. Today of course 30 years famous player stood behind her to get me arrested.""Azad, in his purported response, said: ""Take it easy Kalyan. You have had one too many. Don't act like a juvenile delinquent. You have been entrusted with a very serious responsibility by Didi to everyone along with you. So relax, have a nice sleep. I have no axe to grind with you. I humbly request you as a senior in age to me, not in politics to kindly take everyone together. Stop your childish and erratic behivour. Act like an adult. Don't instigate anybody. Think with the cool mind. Good night.""“In the middle of it all,” Malviya wrote, “the question still lingers: who exactly is the ‘versatile international lady’? That mystery is one for the world to unravel.”","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya flagged an alleged public altercation between Trinamool Congress MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad.

World Health Day: Privatization of government hospitals through PPPs flagged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/world-health-day-privatization-of-government-hospitals-through-ppps-flagged/articleshow/120081699.cms,"Representative image

On World Health Day public health activists and doctors have expressed concern over the privatization of public health services and the handing over of district hospitals and health centres to private entities. They flagged the handing over of district hospitals to private entities in Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Karnataka. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a network of organisations and individuals working on public health have submitted a memorandum to President Droupadi Murmu and chief ministers and health ministers of 18 states with several demands including an increase in funding for public health to 2.5% of the GDP, putting an end to privatization of healthcare services, strengthening and expanding the public health sector and ensuring food security, safe drinking water, employment, women safety and so on as major determinants of health.Recently, Jharkhand government announced that medical colleges will be opened in PPP (public-private partnership) mode in six districts including Deoghar, Khunti, Giridih, Jamtara and Jamshedpur. In Karnataka, it has been reported that new medical colleges will be established in the 11 districts without a government medical college--Tumakuru, Davanagere, Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Kolar, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Bengaluru Rural, Vijayapura, Vijayanagara and Ramanagaram. These are expected to be done in PPP mode. In Uttar Pradesh medical colleges have been established in Maharajganj, Shamli and Sambhal in PPP mode. The UP medical education department has stated that 16 districts qualify for a medical college in district hospitals in PPP mode. Madhya Pradesh floated tenders for starting medical colleges in 10 districts last year. The state also initiated the process to hand over 10 government-run trauma centres and 13 path labs to the private sector.JSA has asked for the universal implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act in all states and for implementing rate control and standard treatment guidelines in the private health sector. It also asked for medicines to be provided free at public facilities and for no tax on life saving essential medicines.","On World Health Day public health activists and doctors expressed concern over the privatization of public health services.

The home minister said police were working round-the-clock ""in rain and cold"" to prevent crimes that were ""unfortunate"", albeit not ""uncommon"" in a city the size of Karnataka's capital. ""I regularly tell the Bengaluru police commissioner (B Dayananda) to ensure patrolling of every area in a disciplined and effective way.""BJP demanded Congress MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra respond to Parameshwara's remark.

Becoming HC judge is tougher now: Less than 50% make it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/becoming-hc-judge-is-tougher-now-less-than-50-make-it/articleshow/120079912.cms,"‘Interviews give first-hand info about legal acumen’

NEW DELHI: For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges once their names were recommended by the HC collegia to the CJI-led three-member Supreme Court collegium. The success rate was 85-90% then, but now it has become much tougher as less than 50% of those recommended were cleared by the SC collegium, which subjected the persons, aspiring to become constitutional court judges, to a suitability test through interview/interaction, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Earlier, the SC collegium had a liberal scrutiny of antecedents by focusing only on the number of important cases argued by the lawyers and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) report detailing their reputation among the advocate community. Almost all the lawyers recommended by HC collegia — barring 10-15% who were dropped because of adverse IB reports or below par income signifying lack of practice — made it to the final list of names sent to the Centre for appointment.Such was the ease of scrutiny that little over a decade ago, the Supreme Court collegium had approved the appointment of a sitting CJI’s sister as a judge of a HC despite her annual income being less than Rs 1 lakh. Her appointment assured her of a judge’s pension.New Delhi: A month after becoming CJI, Justice Sanjiv Khanna in consultation with justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant decided to conduct personal interaction (interview) of the people recommended by HC collegia to understand their judicial outlook and suitability for judgeship in a constitutional court.This move became expedient, despite not being part of the procedure for appointment of HC judges devised by SC through two judgments in 1990s, given the increasing number of controversies created by few motor-mouth judges, some shocking judgments by HC judges and the issue of corruption.SC was forced to take suo motu cognisance of utterances of judges on public platform and judgments that gave skewed meaning to attempt to rape. The interaction/interview with aspiring constitutional court judges has reduced the success rate to below 50% in past few months.As many as 101 names were sent by collegia of 12 HCs – Andhra Pradesh, Allahabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Gujarat, Manipur, Orissa, Patna, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttarakhand. But the collegium comprising CJI Khanna, and Justices Gavai and Kant patiently interviewed all of them and finally selected only 49 of them as suitable for appointment as judges of the HC, which is less than 50% of the recommended names.“Thank God we started interviewing the candidates. It gives us first-hand information about not only the legal acumen and experience of the lawyers, but also their suitability for judgeship. It is tedious to interview candidates at length, but it makes the selection fairer,” collegium judges told TOI.","For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges.

No Yes

NEW DELHI: 'Make in India' is the mantra as global smartphone giants Apple and Samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production to blunt the impact of Donald Trump's higher tariffs on China and Vietnam, when shipping to the US.Even though it is a logistical challenge with major customs and other regulatory efforts required, the issue is being addressed on an urgent basis to ensure that supplies to the US remain competitive.Also read: Flurry of exports as firms raced to beat Trump tariffs Apple, the world's biggest electronics seller, has started to use production at India's factories to ship iPhones to the US, with plans to drastically cut down exports from China. The decision is being taken as Trump has announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian exports to the US, while it is 54% for China, including the 34% announced last week, and 46% for Vietnam.""India's factories will be increasingly used to ship only to the US. Demand in other markets such as Europe, Latin America and even Asia will now be catered to from the China factories.

The latter had acquired the assets of Wistron and Pegatron - both from Taiwan - over the past few years. ""If Apple does not go for developing all-new production zones in locations, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil - all of which have US tariffs of 10% - then there will be a significant expansion of capacity in India,"" the official said.Any such move will see major investments by both Foxconn and Tatas, which could see iPhone shipments to the US grow massively from the estimated $10 billion this fiscal. A lot will, however, depend on discussions between the US with other countries.In case of Samsung, the matter is equally serious as its manufacturing set-up in Vietnam has exports of around $55 billion. ""Samsung will find it better to ship from India at a duty of 26% than export from Vietnam. While this will be a temporary measure till the Vietnamese govt negotiates with the US, it adds a lot of importance to Make in India,"" the official added.

'Cops planted evidence': SC acquits death row convict after a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-planted-evidence-sc-acquits-death-row-convict-after-a-decade/articleshow/120077459.cms,"There is no semblance of satisfactory evidence: Court

NEW DELHI: A botched investigation by police, which also ""planted"" evidence, and lopsided proceedings by the trial court sent a man to the gallows in a rape-cum murder case of a child in Uttarakhand. After a decade in jail under the shadow of death, Supreme Court not only quashed his sentence but also acquitted him.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta, after examining all evidence, including the forensic report, did not find even a single piece of credible evidence against the man and pulled up the state police as well as the trial court for the way in which the investigation and prosecution were carried out. The court quashed his conviction by both the trial court as well as high court.The incident occurred in Udham Singh Nagar district in June 2016 when the girl disappeared during a jagran and her body was found in a nearby field. The man was arrested a day later. The bench said when the FIR was lodged, none of the witnesses claimed to have seen the girl with the man, who was in charge of sound and light at the jagran, but they subsequently alleged so when police made him an accused.It also said the doctor who examined the girl was not cross-examined and he also did not disclose the name of the policeman to whom the samples were handed over nor did he state that the samples were sealed and were handed over in a secure condition. The court said police tried to stick the case on the man by getting his confessional statement.""After being arrested, the appellant confessed to the crime and stated that the clothes which he was wearing at the time of commission of the offence were placed by him in a bag which he was carrying in his hand. He had also stated that he was intending to throw the clothes but before he could do so, he was caught by police. We feel that the theory put forward in the testimony of the said witness... is totally unbelievable. It is clear as daylight that these recoveries have been planted because it is hard, if not impossible, to believe that the appellant, who was a free bird and had ample opportunity to destroy the clothes, would keep the same with him for almost two days after the incident so as to facilitate police to recover the same at a later point of time,"" the bench said.It said there was not even a ""semblance of evidence"" on record to satisfy the court that the samples collected from the girl's body and those collected from the man, which were later forwarded to the forensic science lab, were properly sealed or remained in a safe condition. ""There is every possibility of the samples being tampered/manipulated by the police officers to achieve a favourable result from FSL, thereby, inculpating the appellant in the crime,"" it added.The bench also found fault with trial proceedings as the accused was not properly represented. ""Thus, it is established beyond doubt that the trial was not conducted in a fair manner,"" it said.""The lopsided manner in which trial was conducted is fortified from the evidence of sub-inspector Prahlad Singh who was allowed to narrate the entire confession of the appellant in his examination-in-chief. This procedure adopted by the trial court in permitting a police officer to verbatim narrate the confession made by an accused during investigation is grossly illegal,"" tt said.","Supreme Court quashes a man's conviction in a rape-cum-murder case in Uttarakhand.

"After tulip stroll with Rijiju, Waqf thorns sprout for Omar Abdullah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-tulip-stroll-with-rijiju-waqf-thorns-sprout-for-omar-abdullah/articleshow/120073497.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah went for morning walk Monday in Srinagar’s famed Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju, leading a prickly opposition in the assembly hours later to slam him over rejection of a motion to discuss the Waqf law while indulging in a stroll with the man who piloted it in Parliament.Two contrasting pictures played out. Union minority affairs minister Rijiju described his walk “amid vibrant hues” with Omar and his father, National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, as “refreshing”. Hardly so, chorused People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Peoples Conference as they slammed Omar in the assembly over laying out the “red carpet for the BJP minister who introduced the Waqf bill meant to disempower and debilitate Muslims”.The assembly witnessed prolonged shouting matches after Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather -- who is from NC -- rejected the adjournment motion brought by nine legislators to discuss the Waqf (Amendment) Act. These included eight NC members.Rather pointed out that the Waqf (amendment) bill had now become law with the President giving consent. Also, the law has been challenged in the Supreme Court and assembly rules prohibit debates on a sub-judice issue, the Speaker contended.But NC legislator Tanvir Sadiq, who moved the adjournment motion, cited precedents where laws passed by Parliament were discussed in assemblies across the country. Punjab and Rajasthan assemblies had discussed farm bills, Sadiq said. PDP’s Waheed Parra weighed in, saying Tamil Nadu assembly recently discussed the Waqf law.BJP legislators thumped tables, applauding the Speaker. NC legislators waved black bands, railing against the Waqf Act as a “black law” and raising Allahu Akbar slogans. BJP MLAs chanted Jai Shri Ram.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti accused NC of “meekly surrendering before the BJP” “It’s disappointing that the Speaker has rejected the Waqf motion. Despite securing a strong mandate, the (NC) govt appears to have completely yielded to BJP’s anti-Muslim agenda, cynically attempting to appease both sides,” Mehbooba alleged.She stressed that “the NC could learn” from Tamil Nadu’s DMK govt and the way in which it firmly opposed the Waqf bill. “In J&K, the only Muslim-majority region, it’s alarming that a supposedly people-centric govt lacks the courage even to debate this critical issue,” Mehbooba added. Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti echoed the views.Sajad Lone of People’s Conference hit out at Omar over the garden walk, saying the CM of the only Muslim-majority region in India should have stayed away from Rijiju. “Instead, he tagged along Farooq sahib as well. What a shame,” Lone said.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, stressed the contrast with Tamil Nadu. “Tamil Nadu, which only has 6% Muslim population, passed a strong anti-Wakf resolution in its assembly. The assembly Speaker of Muslim majority-J&K is struggling and refusing by hiding behind technicalities to discuss it,” Mirwaiz said.",J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah went for morning walk in Srinagar’s famed Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju.

Bengal board moves SC seeking 'modification' of order

NEW DELHI: It is BJP versus Mamata Banerjee once again in battleground West Bengal. Months after the fierce faceoff over the R G Kar incident, the bitter political rivals are back on the streets - this time over the school jobs case as they try to corner each other over the loss of jobs of 25,753 teachers and staffers in state-run and aided schools in West Bengal.On April 3, a bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar found that the West Bengal School Service Commission's selection process of 2016 was based on large-scale manipulations and fraud.""In our opinion, this is a case wherein the entire selection process has been vitiated and tainted beyond resolution. Manipulations and frauds on a large scale, coupled with the attempted cover-up, have dented the selection process beyond repair and partial redemption. The credibility and legitimacy of the selection are denuded"", the apex court bench stated in its judgement.While the BJP has gone all out to corner the Trinamool government for the mess, Mamata has been quick to unleash a counter offensive. “Was there some sort of game behind the verdict? Who had played the game from behind?” the chief minister questioned while addressing a gathering of job losers at Netaji Indoor Stadium in central Kolkata on Monday afternoon. In a bid to woo the affected teachers, the Trinamool chief also made an emotional pitch as she announced that she would continue fighting for the sacked teachers as long as she is alive - even if it meant going to the jail.In a clear message to the opposition, Banerjee alleged that a “dirty game” was being played to destroy the state's education system. “A dirty game is being played by some people. One should figure out the real faces behind the masks. Many are trying to mislead people with false information,” she said.Without naming the party, Mamata lashed out at senior advocate and CPM leader Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for initiating the legal proceedings that culminated in the Supreme Court verdict.This as the BJP MLAs mounted pressure on Mamata and accused her TMC government of corruption. Leader of opposition in state assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused Mamata's nephew of taking a bribe of Rs 700 crore.""Mamata Banerjee should go to jail. She is the main beneficiary. Her nephew took a bribe of Rs 700 crore,"" the BJP leader said at a protest of party MLAs.Bengal BJP leader and Union minister of state for education Sukanta Majumdar accused Mamata of ruining the state's education system and demanded that she be jailed. ""Mamata Banerjee has ruined the education system of West Bengal. The next 10 generations will suffer and Mamata Banerjee is responsible for this and she should be put behind bars,"" the BJP leader said.""So many people have lost their jobs. Who is responsible for this? It is Mamata Banerjee and her Cabinet. Did she ever admit that her leaders were the ones who were doing the corruption? If she were sincere, she should have thrown out those who were involved in corruption. But you are involved in this, that is why you are trying your best to save them,"" he said.Aware of the adverse fallout of the BJP's campaign, Mamata has assured full support to eligible candidates who lost school jobs and asserted that her government will ensure they don't remain jobless or have a break in service.The chief minister urged the affected teachers and staff to return to their respective schools and “voluntarily” resume duties. She assured the aggrieved teachers that she would make alternative arrangements for all deserving candidates “within two months”.“You can return to your schools and voluntarily resume teaching. You are still in service since no termination letter has been served to you yet. Our government is duty-bound to ensure that no deserving candidate loses a job. We have plans ready to ensure that the eligible candidates do not face any break in service. We will not allow them to remain jobless,” Banerjee said at the meeting at the Netaji Indoor Stadium here, where thousands of affected teachers had turned up.“I will stand by those who lost their jobs in an unjust manner. I don't care what others think. I will do everything to restore your dignity,” Mamata added.Banerjee appealed to the aggrieved teachers to “trust” the government in doing its job, and said there should be no face-offs between the “deserving” and “tainted” candidates.The chief minister also claimed that her name was being dragged into something about which she had “no inkling”, referring to discrepancies in the school job appointments. “I am ready to even go to jail if anyone wants to penalise me for standing with those who lost school jobs,” Banerjee asserted.“One should figure out the real faces from the masks because many are now trying to mislead people with false information. There is a conspiracy to break the entire education system. A dirty game is being played by some people,"" she said, in an apparent reference to the opposition BJP and the CPM.However, not all were convinced with Mamata's assurances. Some of them expressed dissatisfaction and claimed that no concrete guarantees were provided regarding reinstatement of their jobs.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking 'modification' in its order annulling over 25,000 jobs in schools last week, a high-level source in the education department said here.In an appeal to the apex court, the Board's lawyer requested that either ""deserving"" candidates be allowed to attend their duties till the end of this academic year, or till a fresh recruitment process as directed by the court is completed, whichever is earlier, the source said.With assembly elections in the state next year, the opposition, especially the BJP, will continue to raise the pitch on behalf of the affected teachers. However, unlike the R G Kar incident when Mamata took a long time to meet with the protesting doctors, the Trinamool chief this time around appears to be more proactive in trying to ensure that the BJP does not steal the advantage and put her on the dock once again.(With inputs from agencies)",Mamata Banerjee says she will fight for the sacked teachers as long as she is alive. BJP MLAs mount pressure on Mamata and accuse her TMC government of corruption. Bengal School Service Commission's selection process of 2016 was based on large-scale manipulations and fraud.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120069265,imgsize-88664,width-400,resizemode-4/School-jobs-case-protests.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan 's convoy not only disrupted the traffic but also damaged the careers of over 25 students.On Monday, traffic restrictions were allegedly imposed to ensure the smooth passage of an actor-turned-politician’s convoy, which caused over 25 candidates to miss a vital competitive examination in Visakhapatnam due to late arrival.The examination was set to commence at 8.30 am at the ION Digital Zone building in Chinnamusidivada, Pendurthi.B Kalavathi, whose child was to take the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) 2025 for admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs), stated that her son's delay was caused by traffic restrictions implemented for Kalyan's convoy.""We were stuck in traffic. It was halted because Kalyan was on his way to Araku,"" Kalavathi told PTI, adding that the roads were cleared to allow the actor-politician's convoy to pass.She explained that they reached NAD junction at 7.50 am but required 42 minutes to reach the examination centre, resulting in late arrival and subsequent denial of entry.""Nearly 30 students were affected. We pleaded repeatedly but were not allowed in,"" she said, describing their unsuccessful attempts to enter the examination hall.Parent Anil Kumar noted that a brief five-minute allowance from the examination centre could have prevented his daughter from missing the examination and potentially losing an academic year.Kumar expressed that while CMs and deputy CMs are temporary, the situation could have been better managed if police had communicated with the examination centre for a brief extension.Despite arriving at 8.32 am, Kumar's daughter was refused entry for being two minutes late.A parent spoke to the media, requesting Kalyan to consider arranging a re-examination for the affected students.Visakhapatnam police released a statement rejecting any link between the convoy movement and students' tardiness.""It is clear that the Deputy CM's movement through the area at 8.41 am has no connection to the late arrival of students, who were expected to report by 7 am and certainly before 8.30 am,"" the police said.The police additionally noted that examination attendance was particularly high that day.""Moreover, no traffic was blocked on the BRTS road or the service roads between Gopalapatnam and Pendurthi at any time before 8.30 am to ensure the free movement of examinees to the examination centre, which is located next to a service road,"" the police added.The Janasena founder visited the Araku constituency on Monday to meet tribal communities and initiate several road construction projects.","Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan's convoy not only disrupted the traffic but also damaged the careers of over 25 students.

NEW DELHI: Chaos erupted at Sadaqat Ashram, the Bihar Congress office in Patna, following Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi's visit for a party function. Party workers drove away an individual, calling him thief and 'BJP agent.'The incident occurred on Monday at Sadaqat Ashram, where Rahul had stopped as part of his day-long tour that included a march in Begusarai and a symposium in Patna. While Rahul's visit to the venue lasted approximately 30 minutes, a video clip emerged of Congress workers chasing a man out of the office premises.After Rahul left, journalists noticed a young man carrying a pamphlet expressing support for the wakf bill. The man identified himself as ""Ram Babu Yadav, a native of Bhojpur district.""""He is a BJP agent, who has been sent here in exchange for money,"" alleged party workers as they forced Yadav out of the premises, labelling him as '' and ''.Later, one of the quarreling persons told reporters, ""I am a Congress supporter by birth. I am a Panchayat member. The one who was trading blows with me is an ex-MLA who is actually a BJP agent.""Former state president and Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh also got into the altercation, reportedly slapping a Congress worker on his way out.Two party workers blocked Singh's way while he was trying to reach his car. Singh stopped the fight by slapping one of them before leaving in his car.Rahul's day-long tour included multiple engagements across Bihar, including participation in a march at Begusarai and attending a symposium in Patna before concluding at the Congress headquarters.On his third visit to Bihar in four months, Rahul participated in the ""palayan roko, naukri do"" march in Begusarai, addressing unemployment and migration issues. Though he didn't speak publicly there, he was accompanied by numerous young supporters wearing white T-shirts, reminiscent of the ""Bharat Jodo Yatra"".At the ' Samvidhan Suraksha Sammelan ', Rahul said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had established a structure where 5% of the population governs the country, with 10-15 individuals controlling the corporate sector. Speaking at a symposium in the state capital before the assembly polls, he addressed the Congress alliance with RJD and the Left, which aims to challenge the ruling NDA.""I must be the first person in the Congress to admit that we did not work, in Bihar, with the zeal we should have. But we shall move forward learning from our mistakes. Our party, and the coalition of which we are a part, shall strive for uplift of SCs, STs, OBCs, extremely backward classes and minorities,"" said the Congress leader, noting his party's decline in Bihar since the 1990s Mandal wave.""We recently did something which may not have been great but was still of significance. We reconstituted District Congress Committees. Earlier, two-thirds of these were headed by upper castes. Now two-thirds of these are headed by the deprived castes. This has been in line with clear instructions from (national president Mallikarjun) Kharge ji and me for the organization,"" Rahul added.","Chaos erupted at Sadaqat Ashram, the Bihar Congress office in Patna.

NEW DELHI: The constant rise in wind and solar power generation in India enabled the country to surpass Germany as the world’s third-largest generator of electricity from these sources in 2024, shows a report by global energy think-tank Ember.Though India’s generation capacity from wind and solar — 215 terawatt-hour (TWh) — in 2024 remained much lower than China, the largest generator of electricity from these sources (1,826 TWh), and the US, the second largest generator (757 TWh), it almost doubled over five years, reflecting no signs of slowing down of clean energy growth in the country despite it being a late entrant in these segments of renewables.The report released on Tuesday underlined that the increasing use of electricity for AI, data centres, electric vehicles and heat pumps is already contributing to global demand growth. “Combined, growing use of these technologies accounted for a 0.7% increase in global electricity demand in 2024, double what they contributed five years ago,” it said.The analysis found that the world reached a new milestone last year as all low-carbon sources — renewables and nuclear — provided nearly 41% of the world’s electricity generation in 2024, passing the 40% mark for the first time since the 1940s.In comparison, India generated 22% of its electricity from clean sources last year, with hydropower as the single largest contributor at 8% of the mix, while wind and solar made up 10%. “While India’s clean generation continues to grow, it remains below the global average, highlighting significant potential for further expansion,” the report said.Gobally, renewables were the main driver of overall growth, adding a record 858 TWh in 2024, 49% more than the previous high in 2022. Solar was the largest contributor for the third year running, adding 474 TWh last year. The report showed that solar was the fastest-growing power source (29%) for the 20th year in a row. Global solar generation, in fact, doubled in three years.“Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity,” Ember’s managing director Phil MacDonald said.The analysis also found that, despite the rise in renewables, fossil generation saw 1.4% increase in 2024 due to surging electricity demand, pushing global power sector emissions up 1.6% to an all-time high.It noted that heat waves were the main driver of the rise in fossil generation, mainly through additional use of cooling. “Without these temperature effects, fossil generation would have risen by only 0.2%, as clean electricity generation met 96% of the demand growth not caused by hotter temperatures,” the report said.During severe heat waves across the plains (April-June) last year, India’s electricity demand rose 10.4% compared to the same period in 2023. Increased air conditioning as a result of hotter temperatures accounted for nearly a third of the increase.Overall, India’s electricity demand grew by 5% in 2024.

UPA-era coal secretary cleared in allocation scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upa-era-coal-secretary-cleared-in-allocation-scam/articleshow/120076878.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has discharged former coal secretary HC Gupta and ex-joint secretary K S Kropha in a coal scam case related to allocation of Mednirai block in Jharkhand.The charges included corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating in the allotment dating back to 2006-2009.In his 100-page order on April 4, special CBI Judge Sanjay Bansal charged three others with criminal conspiracy and cheating in the case.They include Kohinoor Steel Private Limited, the private company that bagged the coal block, KSPL director Vijay Bothra (formerly known as Bijay Bothra) and employee Rakesh Khare. According to the prosecution, Gupta and Kropha did not check applications in terms of coal ministry guidelines, which was a major lapse.The prosecution also alleged that they deliberately overlooked apparent discrepancies and changes in application format to favour the company. They did so despite the company claiming net worth of 28 group companies, whereas the guidelines made no mention of group firms, the prosecution alleged.Advocate Rahul Tyagi, appearing for Gupta and Kropha, countered the arguments and said they took all steps required to fairly carry out the allocation of coal blocks. Meanwhile, another court of special judge Arun Bhardwaj discharged former CBI additional legal adviser K Sudhakar, former RS MP Vijay Darda and son, and former junior Union coal minister Santosh Bagrodia from charges of corruption and criminal conspiracy in coal block allocations.","A Delhi court has discharged former coal secretary HC Gupta and ex-joint secretary K S Kropha in a coal scam case.

Murder-for-hire: Nikhil Gupta to go on trial in November,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-plot-gupta-trial-to-begin-in-nov/articleshow/120076731.cms,"Gurpatwant Singh Pannun (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Indian national Nikhil Gupta, indicted by US authorities for plotting to kill Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , will go on trial November 3 this year and not in June or July as was earlier proposed.A US district judge of the Southern District of New York finalised the date for the trial, which will last only for a week, after both prosecution and defence sought postponement of the trial to allow them to file pretrial motions to resolve legal issues that may have a bearing on the trial.In a February 28 order, the Court had asked both parties to suggest a trial date in June or July. While the parties also said in their latest submission they anticipated the trial to last for approximately 2 weeks, the court allowed only a week to wrap up the trial. Gupta, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, has been held in a detention centre since the Czech Republic, where he was first detained, extradited him to the US on June 14 last year.Gupta stands accused of hiring a hitman for $ 100 thousand to eliminate Pannun, a dual US-Canadian national, all at the behest of an Indian government official identified as Vikash Yadav. The murder plot unravelled as the hitman turned out to be a federal undercover agent. Yadav allegedly hired Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun.According to the Department of Justice, Gupta is charged with murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and, if convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each charge. 264The Trump administration has not been reported yet to have raised the murder-for-hire plot bilaterally with Indian authorities but the Biden government placed it right on top of its agenda with India, as it raised the issue at the highest level with the Indian government and pressured it to act against the Indian mastermind.The Indian government formed a high-level committee in November 2023 to probe the US findings. In January this year, days before Trump assumed office, the committee submitted a report recommending legal action against Yadav (without naming him) saying his “earlier criminal links and antecedents also came to notice during the enquiry”.","Indian national Nikhil Gupta, indicted by US authorities for plotting to kill Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, will go on trial November 3.

He urged J&K govt to take positive steps for compassionate appointment of 12-year-old Yuvraj Singh, son of selection grade constable Jaswant Singh who lost his life in the line of duty, when he attains adulthood.Earlier in the day, Shah flew to BSF outpost ‘Vinay’ near the International Border in the Hiranagar sector of Kathua, where BSF director general Daljit Singh Chaudhary, J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat and other senior officers received him. The outpost is named after assistant commandant Vinay Prasad, who was hit by a sniper shot when he and his patrol party were out on a border domination exercise along the International Border on Jan 15, 2019.Shah’s visit comes at a time when security forces have been engaged in an intensive operation in Kathua over the past fortnight against a group of terrorists that is believed to have recently infiltrated from across the border.Shah also inaugurated newly built facilities at the border, including eight women barracks and high-mast lights.Praising the border guarding force’s glorious history, he said: “The entire nation knows that the BSF is our first line of defence, and the force has always performed this responsibility exceptionally well… In every war with Pakistan, the contribution of our BSF soldiers has been as significant as that of the Army.”On Monday evening, Shah, accompanied by LG Manoj Sinha, landed at the Srinagar airport, where CM Omar Abdullah received him.

A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed Kelce's generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Travis Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Travis Kelce recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.

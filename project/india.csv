CDS lashes out at defence companies: 'Show a bit of patriotism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cds-lashes-out-at-defence-companies-show-a-bit-of-patriotism/articleshow/125358608.cms,"Don’t Overprice Products, Deliver On Time: Gen

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns that Indian arms companies were failing to deliver emergency procurements on time and that some of them were even inflating the extent of indigenous content in their products, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"".""Defence reforms are not a one-way street. (Domestic) industries will have to be truthful about their indigenous capabilities to us. You cannot leave us in the lurch. When you sign a contract and don't deliver in that particular time frame, it is a capability that is being lost,"" CDS said at a USI seminar on Friday. CDS said Army had told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames during 5th and 6th phases of the emergency procurements mechanism. tnnCDS said ""most"" of the Indian companies have ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.""This is unacceptable,"" he said. The EP mechanism empowers the armed forces to fast-track contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore that have to be executed within a year, instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.After EP-5 last year, which was reserved exclusively for domestic companies, the defence ministry had approved EP-6.This came following the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.It will help the Army, Indian Air Force and Navy to build as well as replenish their stockpiles of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition, through both foreign and domestic sources.Amid allegations that many domestic companies are merely assembling systems after importing them, instead of manufacturing them, Gen Anil Chauhan said, ""A lot of industries say this (a product) is 70% indigenous, but actually, if you find out, it is not. You have to be truthful about this. Because it is related to matters of security.""The Chief of Defence Staff also criticised the overpricing of weapon systems and platforms.""You will have to be cost-competitive. Cost competitiveness is not for selling to the Indian armed forces. You have to be cost-competitive to compete in the foreign market. You can't have products which are overpriced,"" Gen Chauhan said.","Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"" CDS said Army told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358665,imgsize-28648,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
"Ignoring own orders, Supreme Court has kept case in limbo since 2018",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ignoring-own-orders-supreme-court-has-kept-case-in-limbo-since-2018/articleshow/125358475.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is a classic case of how Supreme Court does not follow its own rulings. While it has repeatedly held any stay order in criminal matters should not continue for an unduly long time, its stay order on a CBI probe into poaching of animals in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has been in operation for the last seven years.Now, the apex court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from Uttarakhand seeking lifting of stay to allow CBI to complete its probe which had suggested ""connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers"". Interestingly, CBI has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned the findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.In this case, HC had in Sept 4, 2018 ordered a CBI probe into all poaching cases in the state in the past five years and to find out the ""complicity, involvement or collusion"" of serving forest department officials in these incidents after the court was informed that 40 tigers and 272 leopards have died in the state in the last two-and-half years. But the HC order was stayed by SC on Oct 22 of the same year, when it passed an ex-parte order on an appeal filed by a retired principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden of the state D S Khati.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI B R Gavai, advocate Govind Jee, representing environmentalist Atul Sati, mentioned the case and pleaded for early hearing. Agreeing with his plea, SC posted the hearing to Nov 17.The petitioner alleged HC passed the order after considering scientific reports submitted by Wildlife Institute of India and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the prolonged stay has effectively stymied chances of detecting and dismantling the transnational, as well as trans state network, which was behind the poaching of tigers.Records of the case show that CBI also filed an application in 2023 for vacation of the order, and also mentioned the findings of its one-month probe before the stay order was passed by SC. The agency said it found various irregularities, including a deliberate attempt made by forest officials to cover up the death of a tiger.Referring to a case in which meat and skin of tiger and leopard were recovered, CBI said, ""During inquiry by CBI of this case, photocopy of case records, as made available by the forest department have been scrutinised and 38 persons including forest officials, private persons and accused persons have been examined. CBI inquiry suggests the connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers."" It said the guidelines issued by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in respect of death were not being followed in Corbett.""During inquiry, prima-facie connivance of officers/officials of forest department of Uttarakhand has emerged in some cases. Gross negligence of guidelines of NTCA by officers/officials of forest department was also seen,"" it said in its report.""It is further submitted that the direction for a preliminary inquiry by CBI was passed by HC only after perusing the entire record, including the technical reports of Wildlife Institute of India, the report of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the communication issued by the head of forest force, Uttarakhand, all of which clearly indicate accountability of senior forest officials including the petitioner (Khati) himself, and in view of transnational as well as interstate nature of network of tiger poaching involved in the matter. The order, therefore, was a reasoned judicial determination founded on cogent material and appreciating the urgency, gravity as well as geographical spread of a network of tigers poachers, aimed to eliminate/ mitigate any future threat to safety of tigers,"" the petition filed by Sati, said.",Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from Uttarakhand. He is seeking lifting of stay to allow CBI to complete its probe. CBI has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358491,imgsize-1425279,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Delhi blast probe: Cops suspect highly unstable TATP, ammonium nitrate behind car explosion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-suspect-highly-unstable-tatp-ammonium-nitrate-behind-car-blast/articleshow/125354421.cms,"‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Investigators probing Monday's Delhi blast suspect that triacetone triperoxide aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on Monday evening near Red Fort. At least two-three kg ammonium nitrate and fuel oil might also have been used along with other chemicals, which would have taken the bomb's weight to 40-50kg, sources said.A large bag, presumably containing the improvised-explosive device, was kept on the rear seat of the i20 being driven by Dr Umar Un Nabi, who died in the blast, CCTV footage revealed earlier. The bag had occupied almost half of the rear seat, indicating the size of the IED. The impact of the blast was such that it was felt 50 metres underground and body parts were thrown in a 50-metre radius.Nicknamed ‘mother of satan', TATP is extremely unstable, highly sensitive to shock, heat, friction and electrostatic discharge. However, it can help build ""military-grade equivalent IED"", capable of impact amounting to almost 80% power of TNT (trinitrotoluene).If confirmed in the official detailed explosive report, which is yet to be submitted by National Security Guard and the forensics, it will add more clarity to the investigation, cops said.""It's dangerous to handle in any quantity; accidental detonation during manufacturing or transportation is common,"" said a senior security establishment officer.This would mean that bomb may not have needed a detonator and could have exploded due to heat or other factors. As an IED assembler, Umar knew this and that's why he took the car to a crowded area, said sources.Police earlier suspected that the blast might have been ""accidental"", a theory which now seems plausible in the wake of a blast at Srinagar's Nowgam police station on Friday. ""That's why there were no shrapnel or pellets at the spot though car bombs don't need them as their own parts act as shrapnels,"" said an officer.TATP's primary ""advantage"" is the ease of obtaining its precursor chemicals, acetone and hydrogen peroxide. They are easily available from common household products.Forensic experts said ammonium nitrate is an oxidiser and the main component in many industrial explosives, most famously ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil). Peroxides, especially concentrated hydrogen peroxide, are also powerful oxidisers.""Along with other things, explosives typically require a combination of a strong oxidiser and a fuel (a combustible material, often organic like fuel oil, aluminium powder or glycerine) to create a high-energy, detonable mixture,"" said an FSL officer.Researchers have even explored hybrid explosives that combine hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate as the oxidising phase, along with a fuel. ""These mixtures are specifically designed to be powerful explosives, sometimes performing similarly to standard ammonium nitrate-based explosives,"" said a bomb disposal squad member. ""Mixing the oxidisers with with a fuel creates a highly energetic and potentially unstable material,"" he added.","Triacetone triperoxide aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on Monday evening near Red Fort. At least two- three kg ammonium nitrate and fuel oil might also have been used along with other chemicals, which would have taken the bomb's weight to 40-50kg.

Judge holds 3am court at home to send laundering accused to ED custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-holds-3am-court-at-home-to-send-laundering-accused-to-ed-custody/articleshow/125358054.cms,"Realtor running 'nationwide laundering scam', says ED

NEW DELHI: It was not the sort of work that is associated with state machinery. The court of additional sessions judge Shefali Barnala Tandon (of the Patiala House courts) was convened at her residence around 3 am on Friday to remand a person accused of money laundering, Swaraj Singh Yadav, in ED's custody.Yadav, who is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd, is accused of illegally selling PM Awas Yojana flats in Gurgaon in all-cash transactions.After a daylong search, Yadav was held by the agency before midnight on Thursday. ED's move came in connection with the alleged laundering of more than Rs 222 crore of funds generated from illegal sale of apartments meant for the poor under PM Awas Yojana.These were sold at an inflated price of Rs 40-50 lakh each to new buyers by cheating the original allottees whose allotment was cancelled, with not even their deposits being refunded. The original cost of a flat was Rs 26.5 lakh.Using these funds, ED said, the accused acquired personal assets, including 500 acres at Ware village in Maharashtra, 100 acres on Pune-Alibag Road, Sai Rupa Resorts in Tirthan Valley in Himachal Pradesh and land in Boston (US), besides financial assets in the UK.""The search for the arrestee started at 6.55 am, and he has to be produced before the court within 24 hours of the search, as per the guidelines of Supreme Court and various high courts,"" the ED submitted before the judge while producing the accused ""at this odd hour"" at her residence.The legal counsel of the accused was still on his way when the court began its proceedings at 3.05 am, and by the time the hearings from both the sides concluded, it was 6.30 am. The judge remanded the accused in ED's custody till Nov 28, when he is to be produced again. Not taking a chance, the judge specifically instructed that the accused be brought before the court at 2 pm on that day.The ED accused Yadav of committing ""a nationwide money laundering scam since 2006, duping thousands of buyers in Mumbai, Jaipur, Kotputli and Gurugram"". As per FIRs registered against him with the Delhi police, an estimated Rs 222 crore of homebuyers' money was siphoned by the accused after layering them through a related ""in-house construction agency"".""The concerted and accelerated liquidation of both personal and company-held assets by arrestee Swaraj Singh Yadav in the recent past strongly indicates his intent to dispose of the proceeds of crime and escape action under provisions of law. The investigation records confirm the urgent disposal of assets and liquidation of funds in anticipation of legal action. He had already sold a flat in Jalvayu Vihar in Gurugram, 40 acres of land in Borgaon, Maharashtra, and 15 acres in Jaipur,"" the ED said.""This coincides with his wife Sunita Swaraj relocating to the US in Aug 2025,"" the agency added and brought to the notice of the court the fact that the accused had transferred huge amounts to the US via a bank account of his wife's in Bank of Baroda.With his children pursuing graduation from Trinity College, Connecticut, US, there is every possibility of his fleeing from justice, the agency said.",Swaraj Singh Yadav is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd.

‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Dr Umer Un Nabi, the bomber behind the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where he would test various kinds of explosives and try out the bomb-making techniques shared with him by his Pakistani handlers via Telegram.Sources close to the investigation told TOI that he possibly put together the ""loosely assembled"" improvised explosive device (IED) responsible for the Red Fort car blast at this home laboratory.The laboratory with all the testing equipment and traces of various kinds of explosives was unearthed during the raid on Umer's house. The information on Dr Umer's house as well as the IED testing and bomb making laboratory installed there is said to have come during the questioning of the arrested doctors of the Faridabad-based Jaish module, most likely Muzammil Ganaie.As reported by TOI on Friday, Dr Umer and two other doctors accused in the ‘white collar' terror case – Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel Rather – were directly in touch with three Pakistani Jaish handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via encrypted messaging platform, Telegram.The handlers were passing on instructions, radicalisation videos and bomb-making DIY videos to the trio via Telegram chat. Agencies believe that Dr Umer was the bomb-making expert among the three, which is why he had set up a laboratory at his home.He would work there, mostly alone, to put together the IEDs as per instructions in the DIY videos and also test the chemicals to be employed as explosives and the triggering mechanisms to maximise the potency of the bomb being assembled.Two major batches of explosives, weighing 358 kg and 2,563 kg each, were recovered from two separate houses in Faridabad during raids between Nov 8 and 10. Indicating that the bombs were yet to be assembled, the explosives were found packed in suitcases and bags, with no metal pieces, usually used as shrapnel to maximise injury, being found.Sources said a possible link between the Delhi car blast, which agencies believe was triggered by accident, and the ""accidental"" explosion at Nowg-am police station on Friday night, may be examined.","Dr Umer Un Nabi, the bomber behind the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the Al-Falah University in Faridabad.

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested but data suggests it may have played spoiler in quite a few seats. In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin. NDA won 19 of these seats while 14 went to Mahagathbandhan. AIMIM and BSP each won one of these seats.Of course, the fact that Jan Suraaj got more votes than the margin in a seat does not necessarily mean it made the difference to the outcome since there is no way of knowing where those votes would otherwise have gone.The party came third in 115 seats and in one, Marhaura, it finished second.Of the 35 seats, within NDA, JDU, Kishor's former party, won 10 of these seats while BJP won five. The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested.

BENGALURU: A routine temple visit turned costly for a software engineer whose shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple in Banashankari III Stage, south Bengaluru.When cops were initially reluctant to file an FIR for footwear theft, the techie insisted they do so because he claimed it's a common occurrence outside temples.The Girinagar resident told police his shoes, bought just six months back, were stolen between 7.20pm and 7.25pm on Nov 6. Wearing his branded shoes (Asics), the complainant visited the temple on his motorcycle. He parked his bike and left his shoes in front of the temple where other devotees had left their footwear.After offering prayers, he walked out of the temple within five minutes only to find his shoes missing. He then approached the temple management and priest. ""I learned that it was a common problem in the temple. The thieves have not even spared the priest. His slippers were stolen twice in the past. Many devotees too shared incidents of losing their footwear. But none of them had filed a complaint with police. I didn't want to ignore such incidents,"" the complainant told TOI.The CCTV camera installed at the temple entrance caught the thief walking barefoot, posing as a devotee, and leaving with the complainant's shoes.A couple of footwear thieves were caught in the past, and they revealed that they usually sold the stolen footwear for Rs 20 to Rs 50 to buy liquor.""If small thefts are ignored, the same person will commit bigger crimes, so they should be taught a lesson and reformed,"" said the complainant.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under the BNS section 303 (theft), CCTV footage have been collected and efforts are on to nab the thief.","Software engineer's shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple.

FARIDABAD: Umar Un Nabi, the doctor at the heart of the Delhi terror plot who was in the i20 that blew up outside Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, killing 13 lives, hid in Hidayat Colony in Nuh for 10 days before the incident, investigators have found.Umar, a professor of medicine at Faridabad-based Al-Falah University, fled the campus after his colleague Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie was arrested by Jammu & Kashmir Police on Oct 30.Also read: ‘Mother of Satan’ in Delhi car blast? Sensing the terror plot – suspected to have been planned by Umar and Muzammil over two years – unravelling, Umar looked for a hideout and, according to investigators, found one in Hidayat Colony where an electrician associated with the university helped him rent a room. Sources said the owner of the house has been detained for questioning.Police and National Investigation Agency are also tracking a hawala network operating in the Mewat region that Umar and the radicalised doctors’ module used for money transfers. Two hawala operators’ financial trails are being investigated, sources said. The fresh leads triggered nightlong raids in Nuh, Faridabad and other places.Teams also conducted searches of quarters where doctors associated with Umar and Muzammil live inside the university and also rooms of students and interns who worked with the two doctors as well as Dr SHAHIN Shaheed, the third accused from Al-Falah arrested in the probe.Soon after the explosion at Srinagar’s Nowgam police station on Friday night, meanwhile, a massive search and combing operation was undertaken at Al-Falah University after midnight. Sources said a convoy of more than 30 police and NaTIONAL Security Guard vehicles reached Al-Falah University. They also conducted a sweep of surrounding areas.J&K Police clarified on Saturday the Nowgam explosion was accidental. Explosive substances allegedly procured by Umar and Muzammil and seized from Faridabad last Sunday were taken to Nowgam.A restaurant owner near the university said the scale of the convoy was unlike anything he had seen before. “They were all over the road. People were being detained. Someone from our village was also taken but later released after it turned out to be a misidentification,” he said.On Saturday morning, Faridabad police’s crime branch deployed its personnel at the university entrance to record details of anyone entering the campus, even security personnel. A police officer said seniors had issued clear instructions to maintain detailed logs to ensure no unauthorised person enters the campus posing as a security officer.Teams from UP Police and the Lucknow NIA unit, including an SP-rank officer, also visited the Al-Falah campus on Saturday. Amid a heightened threat perception, Faridabad police launched extensive checks across the district. According to police spokesperson Yashpal, teams inspected around 140 places of worship, 1,700 tenants, 40 fertilizer–seed shops and nearly 200 guest houses .","Umar, a professor of medicine at Faridabad-based Al-Falah University, fled the campus after his colleague Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie was arrested by Jammu & Kashmir Police on Oct 30.

Delhi Police file new FIR; uncovers 'deeper conspiracy' in Red Fort car blast; doctor module used ‘spycraft’ tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-car-blast-probe-intensifies-fir-uncovers-deeper-conspiracy-doctor-module-used-spycraft-tactics/articleshow/125340660.cms,"Delhi Blast: Security Forces Demolish House of Red Fort Bombing Accused Umar Nabi in Pulwama





NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh.

The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.","The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

Who are Sanjay Yadav and Rameez?

Mahagathbandhan's

NEW DELHI: Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav , and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez. Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) debacle in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.""I have no family. You can go and ask this to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez, and Tejashwi Yadav. They are the ones who threw me out of the family. They don't want to take any responsibility... The whole nation is asking why the party failed like this. When you name Sanjay Yadav and Rameez, you are thrown out of the house, disgraced, abused, and even hit,"" Rohini told news agency ANI.Sanjay Yadav referred to in Acharya’s post is a close aide of her brother Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD-ledchief ministerial face in Bihar. Born in Haryana in 1984, Sanjay Yadav joined the RJD in 2012 and was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the party in 2024.Rameez, meanwhile, is reportedly an old friend of Tejashwi Yadav and comes from a political family in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.Earlier, taking all the blame, Rohini hit out at Sanjay Yadav for her decision and alleged that it was Sanjay Yadav and Rameez who ""asked"" her to do so.""I’m quitting politics and I’m disowning my family … This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez had asked me to do …nd I’m taking all the blame’s,"" she wrote on X.On Rohini's decision, BJP's Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said: ""Rohini Acharya has donated her kidney to save Lalu Yadav. The way Lalu Yadav's family is constantly falling apart due to one or two individuals, no one will like it. I also want to say that if a family is falling apart because of one person, it is not right.""The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.Overall, the Mahagathbandhan vote share and seat count fell sharply, ending below the 40-seat mark and far from government formation. In contrast, the BJP emerged as the strongest performer within the NDA, winning 89 seats, its highest-ever tally in Bihar.The JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, secured 85 seats, while Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV) posted an impressive strike rate by winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested.

Age, health narratives and Bihar’s same-old leadership

Youth involvement: Maithili, Chirag a beginning – needs more

Eyes on Bengal

Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam: The big election year

NEW DELHI: The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member assembly, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the single largest party with 89 seats, closely followed by the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) at 85 seats. The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) also performed strongly, winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested.The NDA powered through the Bihar elections , securing a decisive win despite opposition’s attempts to raise issues such as alleged “voter chori” by the Centre and the Election Commission, and campaigning around the Special Intensive Revision drive and Voter Adhikar Yatra. However, the NDA’s strong organisational machinery, coupled with its development-focused messaging, neutralised these allegations on the ground, leaving Mahagathbandhan struggling.After such a massive victory, the next obvious question is - what next for NDA?The NDA’s landslide victory sets the stage for a governance cycle anchored in its 69-page manifesto — a roadmap promising one crore employment opportunities, Mega Skill Centres and major infrastructure upgrades including expressways, new rail lines, and international airports in multiple cities.With commitments ranging from 10 new industrial parks, 100 MSME hubs, semiconductor and chipset parks, to transformative welfare pledges such as one crore, expanded Kisan Samman Nidhi, free education for poor children, and 50 lakh new homes, NDA now carries a development agenda, which has to build upon Nitish’s decade-long ruling in the state.The election outcome brought a sharp generational contrast to the forefront. Nitish Kumar , 74, secured a renewed mandate even as the opposition showcased one of its youngest leadership line-ups in years. Despite attacks centred on his age, physical health and even insinuations about his “ill health,” voters ultimately sided with experience over experimentation.Nitish’s consolidated support among Kurmis, EBCs, Mahadalits, and women, boosted by central strength, effectively turned age into an advantage. His reputation as a steady, predictable administrator outweighed concerns over longevity or past political allegiance shifts.Thus, the upcoming term will hinge on the NDA capitalizing on Nitish’s stature as a veteran leader, coupled with the anti-incumbency narrative, while countering renewed questions about his age, particularly as this tenure will span till the time he’s 79.This becomes more significant, looking back on political rivals who had leaned heavily on this line of attack. Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor repeatedly claimed Nitish was “ill” and “his mind not working”. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav had also argued that Nitsh was no longer in full command and speculated around the JDU leader’s health.In his victory speech, PM Modi gave credit to ""positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and youth"". Yet, taking a look at the elected MLAs’, overall youth representation is at a low. While NDA did use some new, young faces, the overall Assembly age actually is older. The average of NDA MLA-elects is 53, as opposed to 2020’s 52, suggesting that the overall demographic has remained unchanged more or less in the bigger picture.The standout is 25-year-old Maithili Thakur, whose decisive victory in Alinagar introduces a fresh cultural and youth-centric face into the BJP’s Bihar landscape. Her entry — as one of the youngest MLAs — symbolises youth outreach into its leadership pipeline.Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), with 19 seats, adds another layer to this generational shift. Positioning himself as a “Yuva Bihari” while drawing on the legacy of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag has emerged as a central youth figure within the broader NDA framework.Together, these leaders signal NDA’s start to blend legacy governance with new-age political capital, which needs to consider expansion on this formula.In his victory speech, PM Modi moved beyond Bihar, positioning the win as a launchpad for the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. PM Modi said that “just as the Ganga flows from Bihar to West Bengal, this victory signals the BJP’s win in West Bengal as well.” West Bengal, which shares a border with Bihar, will hold its next assembly elections in April–May 2026, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.The themes that defined the Bihar campaign — welfare delivery, women’s empowerment, organisational cohesion — are expected to form the strategic backbone of the BJP’s Bengal playbook in a high-stakes battleground.The Bihar mandate feeds into the wider national playbook ahead of key elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam. The NDA might aim to replicate Bihar’s formula — welfare delivery, youth mobilisation, cultural messaging, and alliance cohesion — while adapting it to regional contexts.In Tamil Nadu, the battle will hinge on the anti-SIR narrative, as evident by TVK chief Vijay warning that the verification drive has left many unsure whether their names will remain on the rolls. “If I say that even at this very moment, not everyone in Tamil Nadu has the right to vote, would you believe it? Don’t think I’m trying to scare you… this is the truth,” he said, blaming the SIR.Kerala presents a similar SIR challenge, with the addition that the BJP has to break into a left-dominated ground.Meanwhile, in Assam, the contest centres on anti-incumbency. Himanta Biswa Sarma, who left Congress in 2015 and became chief minister in 2021, now faces his popularity test in 2026 as he seeks to secure a third consecutive victory for the BJP.","The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

Bihar poll results: Congress targets EC for 'questionable' election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-poll-results-congress-targets-ec-for-questionable-election-process/articleshow/125355827.cms,"‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi dialled RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav for his feedback on Bihar results as the opposition alliance members ""expressed collective disbelief"" over the Patna landslide in favour of the BJP-JDU combine and targeted the Election Commission alleging questionable election processes. The party ordered an internal inquiry to analyse the election data and said it will soon present the evidence of irregularities.A day after the debacle, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul met to discuss the verdict on Saturday. Also present were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, party treasurer Ajay Maken, and state incharge Krishna Allavaru.Sources said Rahul telephoned Tejashwi Yadav from the meeting for his views on the results, and the RJD functionary expressed shock over the outcome. A similar discussion was also held with CPI (ML) chief Dipankar Bhattacharya.After the huddle, Venugopal told reporters, ""The result from Bihar is unbelievable not only for Congress, but also for the people and our alliance partners. Because a 90%-plus strike rate for a party has not happened in Indian history. We are doing a thorough analysis and collecting the data. Within a week or two, we will come out with concrete proof.""He alleged the EC was totally one-sided and there was no transparency at all, and therefore, the process was questionable.According to sources, the party found JDU voteshare rose from 32.83% in 2020 to 46.20% in the seats it contested, and that of BJP went up from 42.56% to 48.44%, while RJD's share dipped by a fraction from 32.95% in 2020, and that of Congress rose by a couple of points.It was felt that the high scores did not tally with the atmosphere on the ground.It was advocated that additions in the voters' list had to be scrutinised more carefully than the deletions because there is no individual to protest questionable additions while dubious deletions can attract individual complaints. Tejashwi is said to have expressed disbelief that only five votes were polled in a booth (in his constituency). It was also alleged that the commission's final voter number did not tally with the polled and the counting numbers.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi dialled RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav for his feedback on Bihar results.

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey





Behind-the scenes build-up





2025: Outgrowing the dependency narrative





Will Nitish continue as CM?





Nitish: The constant switch





The psychologist shift





From outsider to power centre





NEW DELHI: Amit Shah's pre-poll boast - ""We will win more than 160 seats... It can be 180 also"" - sounded-like a typical campaign bravado, the verdict proved otherwise. The NDA did not just meet expectations. It blew past them, finishing at 202 seats. With this sweeping mandate, one storyline stood above all: the BJP emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, securing 89 seats - its highest tally ever in the state assembly.This rise has taken decades to shape. For years, Bihar was defined by the dominance of socialist and Mandal-era forces led by leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav and later Nitish Kumar. The BJP, despite expanding nationally, had little organic ground in the state. It lacked historical roots, caste-led influence and a natural voter identity in a state where politics was built more on community loyalties than ideology.So the party chose patience.The BJP stayed behind the scenes and allowed Nitish Kumar -- the face of ""sushasan babu"" -- to remain the mascot of reform and governance. While Nitish held the chair and the credit, the BJP quietly built its booth networks, expanded OBC outreach, infiltrated and weakened RJD's voter base, and steadily infused ideological presence into a state long driven by personality-centric politics revolving around Lalu and Nitish.BJP's social engineering strategy in Bihar, largely driven under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , appears to have paid off -- including in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region, where voters did not hesitate to support the BJP-NDA alliance.The Muslim electorate, traditionally seen as outside BJP's fold and often viewed as a disadvantage for the saffron party, showed a noticeable shift this time.The real inflection came in 2020, when the BJP, for the first time, outscored its senior ally JD(U), winning 74 seats compared to JD(U)'s 43. Yet it still supported Nitish as chief minister, signalling endurance over instant glory.This election made the transformation official. During seat negotiations, the BJP secured 101 seats, the same as JD(U), positioning itself as an equal partner and ending the long-held narrative of Nitish-led JD(U) as the ""big brother."" The results confirmed what the groundwork had hinted at: the BJP had outgrown its dependency narrative.However, Nitish Kumar also made an impressive comeback -- rising from 43 seats in the previous election to 85 this time, just behind the BJP. Yet his indispensability may not look the same anymore. With its partners, the NDA nearly touches majority on its own: the BJP's 89 seats, LJP (RV)'s 19, HAM's 5 and RLM's 4 total 117 seats, only a few short of the required majority. The remaining gap could potentially be bridged through talks with nine Independent candidates who are not aligned with either camp.A big question now emerges over who will be projected as the chief ministerial face for the BJP, especially when it comes to placing complete trust in Nitish Kumar - a leader who has built an unmatched reputation for switching sides, often described as practising ""weatherproof politics.""Over the past decade, he has moved between alliances with a precision almost unique in Indian politics. He walked out of the BJP in 2013 just as Narendra Modi was rising on the national stage, partnered with the RJD to form a grand alliance, switched back to the BJP, returned to the RJD camp, and then again shifted to the NDA. The pace and timing of these shifts have kept observers guessing for years.It was Nitish who first worked toward bringing opposition parties together under what eventually became the INDIA bloc. But before the idea could fully mature, he stepped away and returned to the NDA. This is why a familiar phrase keeps resurfacing in Bihar's political chatter: ""Nitish sabke hain."" Today, once again, he stands with the NDA to take on the very bloc he helped shape.Despite these repeated shifts, the BJP has usually not pressed hard on trust issues with JD(U), largely because Nitish’s ""sushasan babu"" image has been politically valuable in Bihar. Even after outscoring JD(U) in 2020, the BJP continued to back Nitish as chief minister. But now, with greater strength and momentum, a new question arises: will the BJP once again settle for a secondary role, or assert itself and claim the lead?When asked who would be chief minister, Amit Shah kept the answer open: ""Who am I to decide it? NDA partners will decide who will be the next Bihar CM."" Although the NDA publicly supports Nitish Kumar, the BJP has avoided formally projecting him as its chief ministerial face, keeping room for negotiation.Nitish Kumar's political shifts -- from BJP to RJD and back, then back again -- may have generated headlines, but beneath those dramatic alliance flips, the BJP was slowly becoming indispensable to Bihar’s power structure. Nitish remained the face, but BJP became the framework.The turning point is not just numerical; it is psychological. For decades, Bihar politics revolved around the Lalu-Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s bargaining weight. The Mahagathbandhan’s collapse, especially RJD’s reduction to 25 seats and Congress winning only 6 out of 61 it contested, underlined that shift.BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani, who was arrested in Samastipur during his iconic Ram Mandir ""Rath Yatra"" on the orders of then-chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav -- a moment can be viewed as Bihar unwelcoming of the BJP. Now, the saffron party stands in sharp contrast to the party's present position, where it holds the strongest hand inside the state's ruling coalition. This transformation marks one of the most significant slow-burn political realignments in recent political history.In the end, Bihar 2025 isn't just about who will be chief minister. It’s about who now shapes the state’s political centre of gravity. And for the first time in three decades, that person may no longer be Nitish Kumar -- but the BJP itself.","The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, securing 89 seats - its highest tally ever in the state assembly.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: An “accidental explosion” at Nowgam police station late Friday night, caused by substances seized during raids in an NCR city and transported to Kashmir by police, killed 9 people and injured 30.J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat said at a press briefing in Srinagar on Saturday morning a huge cache of explosive substances, chemicals and reagents were recovered from Faridabad on Nov 9 and 10, during the investigation of an interstate terror module.“The recovery was transported and kept securely in the open area of the police station (Nowgam),” Prabhat said, adding, “As part of prescribed procedure, samples of the recovery had to be forwarded for further forensic and chemical examination. On account of the voluminous and sensitive nature of the recovery, it was being handled with utmost caution. However … an accidental explosion took place at about 11.20 pm on Nov 14. Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary.” The DGP didn’t take questions.The Union home ministry, too, said in New Delhi that the Nowgam police station explosion was triggered accidentally as explosives recovered from the recently busted terror module were being handled and sampled by forensic experts and other agencies ahead of their transport to FSL, Jammu.There are SOPs for handling and sampling seized explosives and officials in Delhi said these were followed in Nowgam as police personnel, magisterial staff and forensic experts continued working late into Friday night to complete the sampling. Though protective gear, like bomb suits, is available, forensic teams rarely use them. Officials said an external agent yet to be ascertained but which could be a flying spark from something nearby, may have triggered the explosion, with the cars of teams parked nearby adding to its magnitude.The explosion at the police station, operating from a private house in the heart of Nowgam’s posh Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony, shook large parts of Srinagar and reduced the police station to rubble. Among the nine killed were a Special Investigation Agency officer, three Forensic Science Laboratory personnel, two revenue officials, and a tailor associated with the police station. Thirty others — 27 policemen, two revenue officials and three civilians — were wounded.Nowgam police station had investigated the Jaish-e-Mohammed posters that appeared in Bonpora area of Nowgam on Oct 19, an inquiry that led to the busting of an interstate terror module involving doctors and others.Ruling out any terror angle, J&K DGP Prabhat said the cause of this “unfortunate incident” is being inquired into. L-G Manoj Sinha said govt stands in solidarity with the families, friends, and loved ones of the departed. “All possible assistance is being provided to those affected. I've ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion,” he added.MHA officials told TOI that around 358 kg of explosives recovered from Faridabad was transported in a Tata 407 goods carrier to Nowgam police station earlier this week as “case property”. As per the law case property, comprising recoveries from all raided locations, must be deposited at the police station where the FIR is registered.“Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam Police Station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,” the L-G said in a post on X. CM Omar Abdullah extended his “heartfelt condolences” to the bereaved families and prayed for the swift recovery of those injured.Later in the day, when some media channels reported that People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a JeM proxy declared a “terrorist organisation” by the Union home ministry in 2023, had claimed responsibility for the “attack”, the police issued a quick rebuttal: “The claim of PAFF or any other Pakistani terrorist group is patently false, baseless and mischievous.”J&K police had placed concertina wire at the entrance to Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony on Friday, and policemen carrying AK-47s were allowing people to pass only after thorough checks. The road leading to Nowgam police station, located deep inside the colony, was covered with shattered window panes, twisted tin sheets and other debris as residents stepped out to describe what happened the previous night.“It felt like it was a missile strike,” said a resident living a few hundred metres from the police station. He said he was asleep when a loud bang shook his two-storey house and window panes fell onto his bed. For a moment, he said, he believed a fresh war between India and Pakistan had started. “Then I heard cries, and in the neighbourhood several young girls staying here for studies screamed. It was complete mayhem.”Another resident said he grabbed his child and ran outside after the explosion, seeing policemen fleeing in panic. “One policeman kept saying he was fine, and then blood started coming out of his mouth and he fell down,” he said. Another resident said that when he stepped out and walked towards the police station, he saw a man completely covered in black powder asking for help. “I gave him a cloth to clean himself, and I recognised him as the cook of the police station, who had survived. ”Nowgam police station was housed in a rented building for the past three decades. “I have always seen the police station here. I think in 1997 there was a cylinder blast at the station,” a resident said. He said that over the past few days the police station had seen heavy movement, with several officials visiting regularly station as an “important case was being investigated there”.A labourer who works as a chowkidar in a building near the police station said there was a big blast followed by several smaller explosions that shattered windows and cracked walls in the locality. He said that in the morning he saw policemen recovering some body parts. He said the fire service had arrived within 10 minutes of the explosion and helped douse the flames and save the locality.The police station now lies in complete ruin. Its gate and boundary walls are gone. Several vehicles on the road outside are damaged, their window panes blown out. Inside the compound, charred vehicles lie flipped over by the blast, and the building itself is now a heap of rubble.A young man whose house is adjacent to the police station and separated only by a wall said the blast threw him off his feet and falling window glass injured his eyes and face. He then rushed to the nearby Ujala hospital, across the main road. Those killed in the blast were from different parts of the Valley.

What 'jungle raj' means today

The father, the sons & the burden

Tejashwi campaigned in his father’s name.

Tej Pratap

campaigned in his father’s shadow.

Both carried pieces of the Lalu myth - neither carried it all.

Why Lalu still dominates the political imagination

A paradox the verdict did not resolve

Lalu absent, yet unavoidable

NEW DELHI: This election season in Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters. His party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), delivered one of its weakest performances in decades, winning only about two dozen seats. And yet the results, the campaign rhetoric, and even voter anxieties seemed to orbit around one man who never entered the arena.Lalu's absence this year may have defined the election as much as his presence once did.The NDA’s sweeping victory, 202 seats between the BJP, JD(U) and allies, was built on a familiar message architecture that repeatedly invoked the spectre of jungle raj. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his victory speech on Friday, Bihar had rejected ""jungle raj"" and ""katta sarkaar,"" choosing development and stability instead.For decades, the term carried clear caste-coded undertones. Today, its meaning has broadened. Uday Chandra , writer and field-based researcher of politics and society, notes that ""jungle raj functions today less as a narrow upper-caste smear than as a broad anxiety about disorder that cuts across caste lines."" That evolution shaped how women, Extremely Backward Classes, Mahadalits and non-Yadav OBCs understood the stakes of their vote.These groups, Chandra says, ""prioritise predictability, personal safety and routine welfare over expressive grievance politics."" Any party that appeared vulnerable to instability began the campaign with a trust deficit. RJD entered the fray knowing it had to battle not only the NDA, but also a historical memory that no longer targeted only upper castes but resonated across the electorate.The party's messaging, as a result, was pushed into a defensive crouch. ""It forces RJD to defend its reputation continuously rather than focusing solely on policy promises,"" Chandra explains. ""Much of its messaging becomes defensive, explaining, denying, contextualising, which is poor terrain when the median voter wants reassurance, not argument.""The electoral map reflected this tension. Though the RJD won only 25 seats, it recorded the highest vote share, 23%, proving its strongholds of Yadav-Muslim loyalty remain intact. But its reach in competitive seats shrank further. As Chandra puts it, ""RJD’s core still turns out strongly but in marginal constituencies the fear-of-disorder payoff favours the side that can credibly promise stability.""""Lalu remains the master symbol of Yadav pride and political memory,"" Chandra says. Symbolism, however, is not the same as vote transfer.Lalu's failure to ensure that the fruits of post-Mandal empowerment were widely dispersed, and not overwhelmingly cornered by Yadavs, also helped the NDA prevent Tejashwi from pulling non-Yadav OBCs and even a section of upper castes toward his promise of development and a break from Lalu-era politics.Internal fragmentation aggravated these shifts. Chandra notes that the Yadav vote ""can be split when local notables run their own machines or when personal rivalries are visible."" In several constituencies, Tej Pratap Yadav 's parallel activity and the presence of strong independents splintered the Yadav vote. These splits did not hurt the RJD in strongholds — but proved lethal in front-line marginals.For many RJD supporters, Tejashwi is the softer, modern face meant to reassure voters uneasy about a return to chaos. For critics, he remains Lalu’s political heir and therefore the inheritor of jungle raj. He ends up fighting two battles simultaneously: his father's past and his coalition’s present. And in 2025, he lost both.Lalu’s relevance is not sustained by nostalgia alone. The infrastructure he built still shapes Bihar’s politics. Chandra points to three drivers of his enduring centrality: ""historical anchoring, identity brokerage, and a relational patronage network.""His tenure in the 1990s reshaped Bihar’s caste politics in ways that even his opponents acknowledge. His presence still influences alliances, candidate selection and the strategies of regional players. And the organisational networks he built, cadres, kinship links, local intermediaries, continue to be activated during elections.This duality explains why Lalu remained the focal point despite the RJD’s weak performance. Opponents framed their campaign around his record; allies used his legacy as political glue. As Chandra observes, ""Opponents weaponise his record to raise risk perceptions among swing voters; allies treat him as an indispensable ledger item in coalition arithmetic.""The NDA ran as much against Lalu as against Tejashwi. The Mahagathbandhan campaigned with Lalu’s symbolism while trying to present a forward-looking message. Voters judged both through the prism of his legacy.The verdict reveals the limits of symbolic politics. The NDA tapped into a broad desire for stability and continuity. Nitish Kumar’s credentials as Sushasan Babu, combined with Modi’s welfare-driven appeal, proved more persuasive than the RJD’s defensive messaging.The RJD struggled to convincingly present itself as a clean break from the 1990s. Tejashwi’s blended pitch, social justice plus governance, was often overshadowed by ambiguity. Was he an inheritor or a reformer? Voters were unsure.The 2025 election may be one of the harshest electoral blows to the RJD, but it also reaffirms something deeper: Lalu Yadav continues to frame the boundaries of how politics is imagined, narrated and contested in Bihar. Every debate about governance, justice, development or security remains tethered to reactions to his legacy.His absence became a presence.This year, Lalu did not campaign, did not speak, did not even wave from a balcony. Yet no NDA rally avoided attacking his past; no MGB rally could afford to ignore his symbolism. He was not on the ballot but still shaped the ballot box.The verdict has sidelined his party, but it has not erased him. Lalu Prasad Yadav remains the axis around which Bihar’s political conversation still turns.","Lalu Prasad Yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters.

Rahul meets Kharge to discuss Cong's Bihar poll drubbing



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a day after the NDA’s historic win in Bihar, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, saying dissatisfaction was spreading among senior nationalist leaders who had once worked closely with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.Taking a veiled dig at Rahul Gandhi, Prime Minister said that their frustration stemmed from the conduct of what he called the party’s “namdar” leadership. He further accused the opposition of now turning its anger towards institutions instead of accepting the verdict.Addressing a gathering of Bihari residents in Surat, PM Modi said the Congress and its allies had turned to blaming institutions instead of introspecting.“Opposition can't explain poll rout even to their workers and blaming EVMs, EC and electoral rolls' revision,” he said, calling it part of a “habitual” attempt to discredit constitutional bodies.He also pointed to what he described as growing frustration among younger opposition MPs, saying, “When we meet young Congress members or INDIA alliance members in the Parliament, they say, ‘Sir, what can we do? Our careers are coming to an end.We don't even get a chance to speak in Parliament because these people keep saying, ‘Lock Parliament,’ every time.’ They’re unable to answer their own constituencies...”Turning to Bihar, PM Modi praised the state’s voters for delivering a decisive mandate and setting what he described as a global example. He said Bihar’s political clarity had strengthened the NDA while exposing weaknesses in the opposition’s message. “Bihar is famous worldwide today… Bihar’s women and youth formed a combination that strengthened the foundation of politics for decades to come,” he said.He highlighted the 10 per cent vote gap between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan as evidence of a clear preference for development.He sharply criticised opposition leaders, accusing them of attempting to divide voters. ""For the past two years, these 'jamanati' politicians, who are out on bail, were going around in Bihar giving speeches about casteism… This election in Bihar has completely rejected that poison of casteism. This is a very bright sign for the country."" He also referred to controversies over Waqf properties, saying Bihar’s voters had dismissed what he called “communal poison”.The NDA secured a massive mandate in the Bihar assembly elections winning 202 seats while the Mahagathbandhan secured 35.Meanwhile, the Congress on Saturday questioned the role of the Election Commission in the Bihar poll process as its top leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge, met in Delhi to assess the party’s poor performance. Gandhi and Kharge were joined by K C Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Bihar in-charge Krishna Allavaru. Sources said the meeting focused on the Congress winning only six of the 61 seats it contested, its second-worst tally in the state since 2010.After the discussions, Venugopal blamed the Election Commission for the outcome, alleging that “the entire poll process is questionable and there is no transparency”. Calling the result “unbelievable for all of us”, he said alliance partners were also “not believing it”. He argued that a “90 per cent plus strike rate for a political party” had never happened in Indian history and said the Congress was collecting data from across Bihar and would present “concrete proof” within one or two weeks.Venugopal said the conduct of electioneering was “completely questionable” and alleged that “the Election Commission is totally one-sided”.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi predicts major Congress split after NDA’s Bihar Win and Warns Allies Of Growing Instability.

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Rohini Acharya said on Saturday that she has decided to quit politics, declaring that she was disowning her family a day after the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan’s poll debacle in Bihar.Taking all the blame, Rohini hit out at Sanjay Yadav, who is a close confidant of Tejashwi Yadav, for her decision and alleged that it was Sanjay Yadav and Rameez who ""asked"" her to do so.""I’m quitting politics and I’m disowning my family … This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez had asked me to do …nd I’m taking all the blame’s,"" she wrote on X.On Rohini's decision, BJP's Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said: ""Rohini Acharya has donated her kidney to save Lalu Yadav.

I also want to say that if a family is falling apart because of one person, it is not right.""Earlier, the RJD, reacting for the first time to its major setback the state polls, said on Saturday that it is not ""despondent"" despite suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the ruling NDA, which secured a landslide victory with 202 seats.The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.Overall, the Mahagathbandhan vote share and seat count fell sharply, ending below the 40-seat mark and far from government formation. In contrast, the BJP emerged as the strongest performer within the NDA, winning 89 seats, its highest-ever tally in Bihar.The JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, secured 85 seats, while Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV) posted an impressive strike rate by winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested. HAM won 5 seats and Upendra Kushwaha’s party claimed 4.","Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Rohini Acharya said on Saturday that she has decided to quit politics.

PATNA: An electoral rout and a daughter's fury spilling into public view. Rohini Acharya - the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him - announced Saturday she was quitting politics and ""disowning"" her family, igniting a storm that cut across party lines and private loyalties a day after the party's crushing defeat in Bihar.“I don’t have any family, you should go and ask Tejashwi, Sanjay and Rameez. They are the ones who have expelled me from the family because they don’t want to take responsibility,” she told reporters.“The whole world is saying that we will ask questions to whoever becomes Chanakya. The party workers are asking Chanakya why the RJD has reached this state. If Sanjay, Rameez’s name is taken, you will be thrown out of the house and defamed. You will also be hit with slippers,” she added.Her remarks echoed the frustration she had earlier expressed in a social media post announcing that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family. While she did not explain the full circumstances behind this step, her comments once again pointed towards resentment over the influence wielded by two of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s key advisers – Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Yadav, who is from Haryana, and Rameez, who hails from Uttar Pradesh.Her post suggested she believed they had contributed to the party’s disastrous showing in the assembly polls, where the RJD collapsed to 25 seats – 50 fewer than in 2020, when it had been close to forming the govt.“I am quitting politics and disowning my family… This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez asked me to do… and I’m taking all the blame,” she wrote, sparking heated debate across political circles. Her post did not clarify what exactly the two advisers had said, and they were not available for comment.JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said the episode reflected the pain of a daughter who once gave a part of herself to save her father. “Why is Laluji silent over such an important issue? He should not act like Dhritrashtra,” he said.Rohini had gained prominence last year when she contested the Saran Lok Sabha seat, losing to BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy by 13,661 votes. Long before that, her kidney donation to Lalu during a transplant in Singapore had become a defining symbol of her loyalty, invoked repeatedly whenever tensions surfaced within the family.Her displeasure with Sanjay Yadav is not new. In Sept, she indirectly criticised him for occupying the front seat of Tejashwi’s specially designed rath during the Bihar Adhikar Yatra in Tejashwi’s absence – a seat regarded within the family as a symbol of authority. Without naming him directly, she had shared a post stating, “The front seat is always reserved for the top leaders, and no one should sit there in their absence. However, if ‘someone’ considers themselves above the top leadership, that’s a different matter.”Earlier, she had also blamed Sanjay for her brother Tej Pratap’s estrangement from both the family and the party. Tej, whom Lalu distanced himself from after he publicly revealed his relationship with a woman, eventually floated his own party and contested from Mahua, where he was defeated emphatically.Despite her escalating criticism, Rohini has consistently asserted that her actions stem from duty, not political ambition. “I have fulfilled my duty and dharma as a daughter and sister and will continue to do so. I have no desire for any position, nor do I have any political ambitions. My self-respect is paramount for me,” she said in an earlier post.","Rohini Acharya is the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him.

"After 6 years, railways reverts to earlier criteria of appointing topmost officials, recruiting personnel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-6-years-railways-reverts-to-earlier-criteria-of-appointing-topmost-officials-recruiting-personnel/articleshow/125352755.cms,"NEW DELHI: In just about six years, the railways has come full circle and more or less returned to the earlier system, not only for recruiting officers but also for appointing its topmost officials, including the chairman and members of the railway board, as well as general managers across all zones.In the recently notified Indian Railway (Selection to Senior Posts) Rules, the ministry has specified that only officers from Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS) or IRMS (Accounts) will be eligible to become member (finance) and similarly only Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS) or IRMS (Traffic) will be member (operation and business development). Officers from Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) or IRMS (personal) will be eligible for director general (HR) and members for two other highly technical areas will be selected from different railway engineering services.In Dec 2019, the Cabinet had approved the merger of eight railway services into one — Indian Railway Management Services (IRMS) — and govt had touted it as the biggest reform to end departmentalism within the railway bureaucracy.However, implementation of IRMS resulted in confusion and strong opposition from railway employees. The national transporter was unable to attract enough fresh technical manpower through the new service, forcing the railways to revert to the earlier system of recruiting railway engineers and non-technical personnel through the UPSC.Under IRMS, there was a single examination with uniform eligibility criteria for both technical and non-technical candidates. Now, there are two separate exams.“The latest notification on the selection of top-level officials for posts linked to specific services is the final signal that IRMS was conceived and approved without adequate thought,” said a senior railway official.Officials from both technical and non-technical cadres have expressed dissatisfaction with the new rules. A senior railway engineer said, “Engineering services collectively get only 2–3 posts in the board, despite having a majority presence in the organisation, whereas non-technical services get exclusive and uncontested posts. This creates unequal competition pressure.”An official from the railway traffic service added that no IRTS officer will be eligible to apply for member posts advertised in 2026 and 2027, as no officer from the service will meet the eligibility criteria. He said that the requirement of having at least two years of residual service to be appointed as a GM will be almost impossible for most non-technical officers to fulfil.What makes the selection process for GMs even more subjective is the detailed application requirement. Each eligible officer must list: the top five challenging situations faced; the top five lifetime contributions to the organisation; the top five instances of effective teamwork; the top three instances of effective leadership; and the top three systemic changes implemented during their career.","In Dec 2019, the Cabinet had approved the merger of eight railway services into one — Indian Railway Management Services (IRMS) However, implementation of IRMS resulted in confusion and strong opposition from railway employees. The national transporter was unable to attract enough fresh technical manpower through the new service.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125352749,imgsize-1315579,width-400,resizemode-4/in-dec-2019-the-cabinet-had-approved-the-merger-of-eight-railway-services-into-one.jpg"

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey

NEW DELHI: The running of special trains before and during the Chhath-Bihar assembly poll period not only allowed the state’s people to celebrate their biggest festival back home but also enabled them to cast their vote — the railways playing a part in the state reporting a record voter turnout (67%), the highest since 1951.The railways has run around 2,000 special trains from different states to Bihar, out of 12,000 such festival specials. The service is scheduled till the end of this month. In addition, over three dozen unscheduled and unreserved trains from across the country to Bihar were run during Chhath and the polls. Data showed that more than 50 out of the 55 unscheduled trains were bound for Bihar.Most of these unscheduled trains originated from the Northern Railway zone, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Karnal and Panipat. Some of these trains were operated just a couple of days before the two phases of the election — Nov 6 and Nov 11. Railway officials said running of both scheduled and unscheduled trains were as per norms.“Unscheduled special trains were put to service wherever there was a need for clearing increasing numbers of passengers at different stations after assessing demands. In unscheduled and unreserved trains, anyone can buy a ticket for travel,” an official said.The national transporter ran around two dozen of these unscheduled trains between Nov 3 and Nov 11. Officials claimed that the operations are as per requirement and they had announced to keep 2,000 such trains as standby for any emergency requirement. The number of scheduled special trains for the festive season in 2024 was around 7,000, and this year, nearly 70% more trains were operated for the benefit of passengers.It was also the first time when railways had announced an experimental scheme named as “Round Trip Package for the festival rush on discounted fare. Under this scheme, the booking start date was Aug 14 for onward travel between Oct 13 and Oct 26. The return journey ticket could be booked by using the connecting journey feature for the train between Nov 17 and Dec 1. A total of 21,687 round tickets for 33,950 passengers were booked under this scheme.","The railways has run around 2,000 special trains from different states to Bihar, out of 12,000 such festival specials.

J&K Police Confirm 9 Killed in Nowgam Blast After Explosives Recovered From Faridabad Blows Up

NEW DELHI: A day after an explosion at a police station in Nowgam claimed nine lives, the Jammu and Kashmir government on Saturday announced an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the victims' families and Rs 1 lakh for those severely injured.As per an official statement, the compensation will be provided from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, Jammu and Kashmir DGP Nalin Prabhat said the blast, which occurred late Friday, happened while an FSL (forensic science laboratory) team was carrying out sampling of explosives recovered during the investigation into the “white-collar terror module” case busted in Delhi-NCR.Prabhat stressed that the blast was accidental and urged people not to speculate about its nature.“As part of the prescribed procedure, the samples of the recovery had to be forwarded for further forensic and chemical examination. On account of the voluminous nature of the recovery, the FSL team has been carrying out this process for the last two days,” he told reporters in Srinagar.“Due to the unstable and sensitive nature of the recovery, the FSL team was conducting the sampling process and its handling with utmost caution.Unfortunately, during this course, around 11:20 pm last night, an accidental explosion took place. Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,” he added.According to the DGP, the nine who died included one SIA (State Investigation Agency) personnel, three members of the FSL team, two crime photographers, two revenue officials accompanying the magistrate’s team, and a tailor associated with the unit.A total of 32 people sustained injuries — 27 police personnel, three civilans and two revenue officials.",The Jammu and Kashmir government announced an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the victims' families and Rs 1 lakh for those severely injured.

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) chief Farooq Abdullah addressed India-Pakistan relations on Saturday in light of the blast at Nowgam Police Station which was after the explosion near Red Fort in Delhi. He made claims on Operation Sindoor ""again"" and India-Pakistan relations.The Nowgam incident resulted in nine casualties, 32 injuries and substantial structural damage while the Delhi blast killed 12 people.In his interview with ANI, Abdullah said, ""I hope no such thing (Operation Sindoor) will happen. Nothing came out of it (Operation Sindoor). Our 18 people died. Our borders were compromised. I hope both nations improve their relations. That is the only way. I want to repeat what Vajpayee Ji said, friends can be changed, but neighbours cannot.""Abdullah also called for an extensive independent inquiry into the Nowgam incident today, suggesting that improper handling of explosives potentially led to the incident that resulted in nine fatalities and damage to residential buildings.In his earlier Srinagar interview with ANI, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister expressed concern about the handling of explosive materials by local authorities, emphasising the importance of consulting specialists.""This is our mistake, those who understand this explosive better, we should have talked to them first about how to deal with it instead of trying to handle it ourselves, you saw the result, nine people lost their lives. So much damage was caused to the houses there,"" he had said.Abdullah discussed the impact of the Nowgam incident in relation to the current climate of distrust towards Kashmiri residents across the nation following the Delhi blast. ""We haven't yet come out of the crisis in Delhi where fingers are being pointed at every Kashmiri. When will that day come when they will accept that we are Indians and we are not responsible for this, ask those who are responsible why these doctors had to take this path? What was the reason?"" he commented.The JKNC leader emphasised the need for accountability, noting that the circumstances of the blast, including the suspected involvement of medical professionals, require detailed investigation. ""There is a need for a thorough investigation and study of this,"" he stated, urging authorities to determine responsibility and implement preventive measures.The Jammu and Kashmir Police are currently investigating the Nowgam explosion, which occurred while handling an explosive device within the police station.","Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) chief Farooq Abdullah addressed India-Pakistan relations on Saturday in light of the blast at Nowgam Police Station.

Bihar polls: Congress workers in tears as state chief Rajesh Ram loses Kutumba – video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-congress-workers-in-tears-as-state-chief-rajesh-ram-loses-kutumba-video/articleshow/125351110.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress workers in Bihar were seen in tears on Saturday as they met the party’s state president, Rajesh Ram, who suffered a heavy defeat in Kutumba. Video from the Congress office showed distraught cadres consoling Ram, who lost the seat to HAMS candidate Lalan Ram by more than 21,000 votes.In Kutumba, the final count told the story plainly. Lalan Ram secured 84,727 votes, defeating Rajesh Ram, who managed 63,202. The Congress state president’s defeat became emblematic of a wider collapse for the party across the state, where it won only six of the 61 seats it contested, its second-worst performance in Bihar since 2010. The mood inside the party quickly turned grim, with senior leaders rushing into emergency meetings in Delhi to understand what went wrong.While the Congress and its allies blamed the outcome on what they called a compromised election process, including the hurried Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls, critics dismissed their concerns. K C Venugopal said the result was “unbelievable” and claimed the Election Commission had acted in a “one-sided” and non-transparent manner. The party alleged “vote chori on a gigantic scale,” an accusation echoed by the Shiv Sena (UBT), which called the election a “scam”.The BJP and its partners, meanwhile, celebrated the sweeping mandate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the opposition was blaming EVMs and the Election Commission because they could not explain their defeat to their own workers. NDA leaders argued that the mandate was an endorsement of governance and the SIR, saying fake voters had finally been removed from the rolls.","Congress workers in Bihar were seen in tears on Saturday as they met the party’s state president, Rajesh Ram.

The road ahead: Continuity with caution

NEW DELHI: Bihar ’s 2025 verdict was at once predictable and surprising. Predictable because as usual the NDA retained the power and Nitish Kumar is once again expected to retain the CM chair.Surprising because new, youthful faces such as Chirag Paswan and Maithili Thakur played decisive, complementary roles that helped NDA push past the 200-seat mark.The lesson from this election is clear - in Bihar’s complex social landscape, a mix of experienced leaders, steady welfare delivery and energetic young faces has proved more effective than relying only on old popularity or only on youth-driven politics.Despite the surge of young voters, the new Bihar Assembly has actually grown older — with the average MLA age rising to 53, according to data from the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).Bihar’s demographics set the stage for an assumed Gen Z breakthrough. The state is young: nearly 57–58% of the population is under 25 and Gen Z accounts for roughly 25% of registered voters.Yet the ballot did not produce a wholesale generational turnover. Voter turnout rose to 67.13%, the highest since 1951, but the assembly that emerges remains led by established figures.The paradox points to a deeper truth: youth ambitions are powerful as a narrative, but they need organisation, welfare credibility and cross-cutting alliances to translate into seats.Nitish Kumar’s appeal rested on delivery and familiarity. His long record including infrastructure, electrification, women-centred schemes and visible rural services have converted into voter trust, especially among families worried about daily survival and local governance.That credibility was amplified by BJP’s organisational muscle power and national messaging, producing a coalition that combined administrative reputation with ground-level reach.But this was not a victory of seniority alone. The NDA’s seat haul hinged on a deliberate fusion of styles: the steady administrative image of Nitish; BJP’s organisational discipline and PM Modi’s national appeal and the insurgent energy of newer coalition partners.Chirag Paswan’s description of himself as “sabji mein namak” captured the strategic role he played.The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) won 19 of the 29 seats it contested, a performance that materially pushed the NDA beyond the 200-seat threshold.More striking was the party’s ability to wrest seats from the Mahagathbandhan: LJP(RV) took 17 constituencies that had earlier been with the opposition, undercutting expectations about its limited reach.Chirag’s rise was not accidental. His bargaining power had roots in the 2024 Lok Sabha sweep, where his party performed strongly and in smart seat-sharing talks that gave LJP(RV) winnable contests.By winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested in assembly elections, LJP(RV)’s strike rate suggests that the party had converted local appeal into electoral returns and reasserted Chirag as a major NDA face in Bihar’s new political arithmetic.The BJP’s capture of Alinagar through Maithili Thakur underlined a different dynamic: cultural influence and youth appeal can convert into real votes when rooted in local identity and persistent outreach.The 25-year-old folk singer — a social media star and cultural ambassador for Mithilanchal has defeated RJD’s Binod Mishra and looked set to become the state’s youngest MLA.Her campaign blended grassroots outreach with a strong online following, demonstrating that youthful charisma, when allied to party structure and local ties, can win seats that long resisted the BJP. Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav aggressively pitched themselves as the voice of young India, placing job creation, caste-based census and economic justice front and centre.Rahul’s “Voter Adhikar Yatra” also saw him raise the issue of “vote chori”, warning young voters of manipulation and urging them to defend democracyBefore the first phase of voting in Bihar, in a video message, Rahul addressed his “Gen-Z brothers and sisters” in Bihar, saying: “Tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future … Stay alert to every conspiracy and manipulation at the booths … The future of Bihar is in your hands.”Tejashwi, in particular, sought to expand his connection with first-time voters through social media-heavy messaging and large rallies projecting himself as the future of Bihar.Yet, critics argued that assurance of results mattered more than rhetoric. Prashant Kishor , once an architect of JD(U)’s electoral strategies, did not miss the opportunity to take a swipe at both sides, calling them outdated in approach and disconnected from ground realities.Kishor questioned Rahul’s deep engagement with the state. He asked, “How much knowledge does Rahul Gandhi have here? Rahul Gandhi comes here, roams around, does a couple of show-bites and then he is gone.”“When the people of Bihar are not listening to him (Rahul Gandhi), then why would Gen Z listen to him? Gen Z is not a homogeneous group in Bihar who acts on someone’s call or on the basis of their assessment,” Kishor said.New and “youth-first” political experiments, including Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj aimed to target a niche of voters through their extensive door-to-door campaigning. However, the party struggled to convert enthusiasm into booth-level performance.Changing politics in Bihar requires patient groundwork: building cadres, stitching alliances and nurturing constituency-specific strategies. A single poll cycle rarely grants instant success.Another twist in Bihar’s electoral story comes from its women voters. This year, women recorded a turnout of 71.6%, significantly higher than the 62.8% turnout among men. This creates a clear gender advantage in the NDA’s favour.Women-centric welfare measures, particularly direct cash transfers and mobility-support initiatives, played a critical role.Nitish Kumar’s long-running focus on women’s empowerment, including the Rs 10,000 direct assistance scheme, strengthened trust and reinforced a dependable female vote bank.Bihar’s verdict shows that generational change in politics can be gradual rather than revolutionary.For the NDA, the 2025 win validates a coalition approach that pairs veteran governance with youthful faces. For the opposition, the message is stark: charisma must be matched by credible welfare offerings and grassroots architecture.Bihar’s politics will stay complicated. But the 2025 election offered a lesson that is both simple and hard to achieve: in a state as socially layered as Bihar, mixed leadership with combined experience, welfare credibility and new energy is not just desirable, it is essential.","Bihar’s demographics set the stage for an assumed Gen Z breakthrough.

Police bust international cybercrime gang siphoning bitcoins from americans through microsoft support scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-bust-international-cybercrime-gang-siphoning-bitcoins-from-americans-through-microsoft-support-scam/articleshow/125350116.cms,"-

BENGALURU: In what looks like a major syndicate of an international cybercrime network, a gang operating from the city targeted citizens in the USA and siphoned off money under the pretext of Microsoft Technical Support personnel handling the 'Federal Trade Commission'. The gang was busted. However, cops are yet to discover the number of victims and the amount lost by them.Acting on a tip-off, police teams from the special cell of the Cyber Command, along with sleuths from the Cyber Crime Police Station, Whitefield division, raided the office premises of Musk Communications located on the 6th Floor, Delta Building, Sigma Soft Tech Park, Whitefield Main Road, near Varthur Kodi. They seized computers, hard disks, laptops, mobile phones, and other electronic gadgets. Additionally, 21 staffers working in the office were arrested. They were produced before a court on Saturday evening and were taken into police custody for questioning. Equipped with a search warrant from a court, the raids were carried out on Friday and Saturday.The firm Musk Communications rented a spacious 4,500 square feet office premises from this August, police investigations revealed. “We have to question the building owner on some points.Also, the rent for this office premises runs into several lakhs for sure,” an investigating officer said.A senior police officer explained their modus operandi to STOI and said, “The miscreants deployed malicious Facebook advertisements to freeze victims’ computers, falsely claimed data compromise, and extorted money under the guise of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) violations. They ran targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns aimed at United States-based users, embedding malicious code disguised as genuine service links or security alerts,” he said, adding that “When an unsuspecting user clicked on the advertisement, the code executed and locked the system. A pop-up message then appeared, falsely claiming to be from Microsoft Global Technical Support and displaying a fake helpline number. Once victims contacted the number, the fraudsters impersonated technical support executives. They misled victims by claiming their computers were hacked, their IP addresses were compromised, and that their banking credentials and personal data were at high risk. Under the pretext of resolving the alleged hacking and 'FTC violations', the fraudsters falsely claimed that the Federal Trade Commission was involved. They coerced victims into paying for security fixes, compliance procedures, or immediate risk mitigation, collecting large sums from them,” he said.Director General of Police-Cyber Command Unit, Bengaluru, Pronab Mohanty, said they suspect miscreants of duping the victims of hundreds of crores in the form of bitcoins. According to Mohanty, they acted on a concrete tip-off about the company and its illegal activities.“The raids were carried out for two days. During the operation, 21 employees, who were actively involved in cheating foreign nationals by posing as Microsoft support technicians, were secured and arrested. Several computer systems, digital devices, mobile phones, and other electronic evidence used for committing the offence were seized. A large and detailed picture will come out in the near future as we question the suspects,” Mohanty said.","Cops are yet to discover the number of victims and the amount lost by them. 21 staffers working in the office were arrested.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday took a swipe at Tejashwi Yadav without naming him, recalling the RJD leader’s earlier remark on what would happen to the Waqf Amendment Act if the opposition Mahagathbandhan alliance came to power in Bihar.PM Modi’s comments came a day after the Mahagathbandhan suffered a heavy defeat in the Bihar assembly elections , with the ruling NDA sweeping the state. Tejashwi Yadav was the opposition alliance’s chief ministerial candidate.“In Bihar, public land was frequently encroached upon and converted into Waqf property. We have seen a similar situation in Tamil Nadu, where even centuries-old villages were declared as Waqf,” the prime minister said in Surat, in his home state of Gujarat, while addressing members of the Bihar community.He added that encroachments of public land by the Waqf Board were the reason the government introduced reforms to the Waqf law.“A leader who is now out on bail, along with his allies, would tear up copies of the law and claim they would never allow it in Bihar. But the people of Bihar rejected this communal poison completely and chose the path of development,” PM Modi said, referring to Tejashwi Yadav, who — along with members of his family — is out on bail in the alleged land-for-jobs money laundering case.At a public rally in the Muslim-dominated Katihar district on October 26, Yadav had vowed that if the Mahagathbandhan came to power, the Waqf Amendment Act would be “thrown into the dustbin.”The RJD leader's comments came a day after a controversy triggered by party MLA Qari Sohaib, who had declared that the legislation would be “torn apart” if Tejashwi became chief minister.The Waqf (Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament in April. While the government described the law as a step toward transparency and an instrument to empower backward Muslims and women in the community, the opposition argued that it infringes upon the rights of Muslims.On September 15, the Supreme Court, stayed a few key provisions of the law while upholding its constitutionality.",PM Modi's comments came a day after the Mahagathbandhan suffered a heavy defeat in the Bihar assembly elections.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed's elder brother, says family is in 'complete disbelief' Says family had not been in contact with her for past four years. Former husband Dr Zafar Hayat also expressed shock over her alleged role in case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125272443,imgsize-633640,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

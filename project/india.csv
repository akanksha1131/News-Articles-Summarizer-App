NEW DELHI: A huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee delivered her maiden speech.She was speaking on ' Empowerment of Women in Bengal and its Success', following an invitation from the institution.The chief minister was interrupted suddenly by a group of protesting students, who tried to disrupt her speech by raising the issue of post-poll violence and the RG Kar College rape-murder case .""Please speak clearly. You have the right to speak, this is a democracy,"" she responded.""Love you, brother. If you want to do politics, go tell your party in my state. I will send chocolate to you and your ideology,"" Mamata was heard telling the protesters.She also pulled out a black-and-white photograph from August 16, 1990, showing her injuries and bandages following a violent attack by CPM supporters at Kolkata's Hazra crossing.On RG Kar, the CM made it clear that the case was ""sub judice"" and the Centre (CBI) was now tasked with the probe.""This matter is not related to politics. This case is with the central government and is sub judice. Do not do politics here,"" she told the protesters.Another person asked the West Bengal chief minister whether she was ""anti-Hindu.""She replied, ""I work for everyone. I have been elected as an MP seven times and do not take a single rupee as pension from the government."" She further stated, ""Ultra-left and communal forces are making such allegations.""""Now, I will come twice each year to Oxford. You gave me strength and inspiration,"" she added.In her address, Mamata claimed that her governance model does not allow discrimination and that she prioritizes the welfare of all sections of society. She also stressed the importance of inclusive development and stated that division in society is counterproductive.""If I die, before my death, I want to see unity. Unity is our strength, and division leads to our fall. This was Swami Vivekananda's belief. Keeping unity is a difficult task, but dividing people takes only a moment. Do you think the world can sustain such a divisive ideology?"" she asked.""When I am in the chair, I cannot divide society. I have to look after the weaker sections and the poor. We have to work hard for them. At the same time, we must work for all religions, castes, and creeds together, move forward with them, and help them,"" she said.The Bharatiya Janata Party launched an attack on Mamata, labeling her a disgrace to the constitutional office she holds.In a social media post on X, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said, ""West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world’s largest economy… This is truly shameful.""""She is a disgrace to the constitutional office she holds. Who behaves like this on foreign soil?"" he added.Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress lauded Mamata and quoted Rabindranath Tagore's famous poem ""Chitto Jetha Bhoyshunyo"" , ""Where the mind is without fear, and the head is held high.""""She doesn’t flinch. She doesn’t falter. The more you heckle, the fiercer she roars. Smt.

House panel slams HAL 'inefficiencies',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-panel-slams-hal-inefficiencies/articleshow/119623426.cms,"Already facing flak for the huge delay in production of the indigenous Tejas fighters as well as the grounding of the over 330 Dhruv advanced light helicopters for safety checks since a crash on Jan 5, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) came under fresh ack-ack fire on Thursday in Parliament.The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed HAL for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “Systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder HAL’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh in recent weeks has publicly lashed out at HAL, noting that he was “just not confident” of the defence PSU, which was a “very wrong” thing to happen. The IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready, he said.The committee, on its part, stressed the “urgent need” for HAL to transition from a “reactive to a proactive R&D strategy”, ensuring that technological advancements align seamlessly with national defence objectives and market requirements.While recognizing HAL’s pivotal role in advancing the country’s defence and aerospace capabilities, contributing significantly to indigenous aircraft, helicopters and engine development, the committee said a CAG report of 2023 had highlighted “critical shortcomings” in its project planning, execution, procurement delays and cost overruns.“The committee firmly believes that rigorous adherence to pre-project processes, enhanced risk assessment mechanisms, and structured stakeholder engagements are essential for HAL to achieve global competitiveness in defence manufacturing,” it said.Strengthening financial oversight, establishing robust market research frameworks, and ensuring timely compliance with international certification standards is crucial for HAL to position itself as a leading aerospace powerhouse on the global stage.The committee urged the HAL and defence ministry to implement the recommendations in letter and spirit, ensuring that future projects are executed with greater efficiency, financial prudence, and strategic foresight.“The success of India’s defence modernization and indigenization efforts will depend not just on technological advancements but on the ability to integrate innovation with effective project management, accountability, and long-term vision. HAL’s progress in these areas will not only strengthen national security but also cement India’s position as a global leader in defence and aerospace manufacturing,” it said.","The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed HAL for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “Systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder HAL’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119623444,imgsize-24094,width-400,resizemode-4/119623444.jpg"

The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock. But they slipped away, triggering a manhunt across the region.The search entered its fourth day, with the Army, NSG, BSF, CRPF, and J&K police deploying advanced surveillance tools, bulletproof vehicles, UAVs, drones, and sniffer dogs.On Monday, search teams found four loaded magazines of an M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, and materials for making IEDs.

Resolution against Waqf Amendment Bill



'Clever political move'



NEW DELHI: Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are nearly a year away, but it seems chief minister MK Stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the polls by latching on to some of the key issues raised by the BJP When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, MK Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war.The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that. He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.""In the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states. Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number). Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled. This is a mater of Tamil Nadu's rights. All leaders and political parties should jointly speak across party lines on the issue,"" Stalin said raising the pitch.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I have an appeal! Try to develop India rather than Hindi. Sanskrit cannot be developed even if you spend thousands of crores. You will spend crores to develop a language that is not spoken by the people. Will you betray our Tamil language that is recognised in several countries and spoken by the people?"" he added.With the three-language policy an emotive issue in the state, even Stalin's political opponents were forced to attend his meeting.The Tamil Nadu chief minister later took the lead in mobilising other southern states and chaired a meeting on the issue of delimitation and its fallout on these states.Stalin followed up his language and delimitation offensive by raising the pitch against the Centre's Waqf Amendment Bill. The Tamil Nadu assembly passed a resolution against the proposed Waqf Bill in the assembly and insisted that the Union government recall the Bill as it would badly affect the minority Muslims.Piloting the resolution, Stalin said the bill is ""destroying the rights of Muslims. This is against the freedom of religion. This is hurting Muslim sentiments."" The Tamil Nadu CM further claimed the Bill was an assault on the constitutional rights of minorities and their institutions.While the BJP walked out, all other parties including the principal opposition AIADMK and NDA partner the PMK supported the resolution.""All parties in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly have unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to be brought by the Union BJP government! The BJP is working with the aim of crippling the functioning of the Waqf organisation by making several amendments at once, without any demand from Muslims,"" Stalin wrote on X.Senior journalist and political analyst Vijaya Sankar says chief minister Stalin has played a smart political game in the run up to the assembly elections next year.""It was a clever move on the part of the DMK chief. Instead of making it a party issue, Stalin made the language and delimitation issues a question of Tamil Nadu's pride and ensured the backing of even his political opponents,"" he says.""The resolution against the Waqf Bill in the state assembly will help the ruling DMK consolidate the Muslims who constitute around 12% of population,"" says Vijaya Sankar.The BJP and the AIADMK have accused Stalin of orchestrating ""political drama."" Their attacks notwithstanding, the fact is that Stalin has managed to set the narrative and has forced his political opponents to back him on these issues.One look at Stalin's response to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's attacks on language row and it sums up how Tamil Nadu chief minister has tried to turn the controversy over these issues into an advantage for his party.""Tamil Nadu's fair and firm voice on #TwoLanguagePolicy and #FairDelimitation is echoing nationwide--and the BJP is clearly rattled. Just watch their leaders' interviews. And now Hon'ble Yogi Adityanath wants to lecture us on hate? Spare us. This isn't irony--it's political black comedy at its darkest. We don't oppose any language; we oppose imposition and chauvinism. This isn't riot-for-votes politics. This is a battle for dignity and justice,"" Stalin posted on X.Stalin may now try to keep these issues alive as the state approaches next year’s assembly elections.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the assembly elections.

Kunal Kamra row: Maharashtra minister calls on police to 'arrest' comedian and not 'test party's patience',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kunal-kamra-row-maharashtra-minister-calls-on-police-to-arrest-comedian-and-not-test-partys-patience/articleshow/119604131.cms,"Maharashtra Minister and Shiv Sena leader Shambhuraj Desai calls for Kunal Kamra's arrest

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra tourism minister Shambhuraj Desai urged police on Thursday to promptly arrest comedian Kunal Kamra , cautioning against testing party workers' patience.This comes after Sena workers had vandalised a Mumbai studio on Sunday night where Kamra had recorded his show, expressing anger over his parody song criticising Maharashtra deputy Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Eknath Shinde ""We have been asked by Shinde to be observe restraint, that is why we are quiet. As Shiv Sena workers, we know how to drag him out from wherever he is hiding, but as ministers we have some restrictions,"" Desai told reporters. ""We want to tell the police, do not test our patience and nab him from wherever he is, put him in a tyre and give him 'prasad',"" he added. In Marathi, 'prasad' traditionally refers to a divine offering, whilst also serving as a subtle reference to punishment.This row erupted when, during his recent performance, Kamra performed a parody version of a popular song from ""Dil Toh Pagal Hai"", incorporating the term ""gaddar"" (traitor), apparently directed at Shinde.Following Sunday night's vandalism at the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar by Shinde-led Shiv Sena activists, several individuals were arrested and subsequently released on bail. The Khar police later filed a FIR against Kamra based on Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel's complaint regarding alleged defamatory statements about Shinde.",Shambhuraj Desai urges police to promptly arrest comedian Kunal Kamra.

Disagree Somewhat agree Strongly agree

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha on Tuesday raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha about India's position in artificial intelligence (AI), as the United States and China continue to advance in the field.He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru. Therefore, alongside 'Make in India,' India must also move forward with 'Make AI in India ,'"" the AAP MP said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, where he said AI could help improve sectors like health, agriculture, and education.",Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha raised concerns about India's position in artificial intelligence.

"Isro attempts & succeeds in 'rolling' SpaDeX satellites, learning key for future docking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-attempts-succeeds-in-rolling-spadex-satellites-learning-key-for-future-docking/articleshow/119613052.cms,"What was done

Why it’s important

BENGALURU: Isro, which recently undocked the two satellites part of its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on March 13, has successfully completed another experiment — the “rolling” or “rotating” experiment — which involved circumnavigation of one of the satellites and bringing it back to the same spot.This experiment, being likened to the Chandrayaan-3 “hop” experiment the space agency conducted on Moon in terms of learning it provides for future missions, would help Isro validate multiple softwares, ground station control and more.Isro chairman V Narayanan confirmed to TOI that the experiment was carried out last week, and said: “We’ve completed the rolling experiment. The satellites have a lot of propellant… I have only told [the teams] one thing, please do everything [on] simulation on ground [first]. Let us be very careful. Let us not make any mistakes as a wealth of data can be generated [through various experiments].So, what exactly did Isro do? Imagine you and your friend outside a coffee shop on Church Street (Bengaluru).After a long hug (docking), your friend has taken a few steps away (undocking) from you while still in your line of sight. Now, your friend either does a somersault or runs around making a circle, returning to her/his original position. That’s what happened with the satellite in the latest experiment.During the whole time, the satellite performing the experiment was in the line of vision of the other satellite. The experiment was to help Isro validate its control over satellite manoeuvring from ground — that means a slew of softwares, sensors, positioning tech etc. There is no immediate confirmation if the satellite did the circumnavigation (do the full circle) horizontally or vertically (somersault).As reported by TOI earlier, Isro’s first docking on Jan 16, was only the first step towards Isro mastering this technology that is critical for several future missions, including the Chandrayaan-4 sample return mission to the Moon and human spaceflight missions part of the extended Gaganyaan programme Isro will need to dock in various conditions, some of which will be attempted as part of the current mission. Isro will conduct more docking as part of SpaDeX. “The next slot is only next month. We are planning many things,” Narayanan said.Last week’s experiment will help Isro understand what it takes to bring an object to a desired spot from different orientations for docking. It will also help Isro learn whether docking could be done vertically and so on.With a lot of fuel left in the satellite, Isro is expected to carry out more experiments. Afterall, SpaDex is an experimental mission and Isro is hoping to make the most of it. Also, once the next docking is complete, there will be another attempt to do power transfer between the satellites, learning from which — some lessons have already been learnt from the first attempt — will be crucial for future mission design and development.",Isro chairman V Narayanan confirmed to TOI that the experiment was carried out last week.

Armed forces conduct massive integrated exercise in Arunachal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-conduct-massive-integrated-exercise-in-arunachal/articleshow/119613487.cms,"NEW DELHI: India-China diplomatic talks may now be taking a slightly “positive” trajectory but the armed forces continue to hone their high-altitude combat skills through intensive exercises, while the Army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders.‘Prachand Prahar (fierce attack)’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-Service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector of the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the last three days.“The exercise involved Army, IAF and the other combat elements in a synergised combat drill designed to simulate future warfare. It reinforces India’s resolve to deter and, if necessary, decisively respond to any emerging security challenge along its strategic frontiers,” a senior officer said.Towards the western sector of the LAC, which stretches from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, the headquarters of the new 72 Infantry Division is coming up at Pathankot under the Udhampur-based Northern Command. “There will be no fresh accretion of troops for the 72 Division. It’s part of the Army’s restructuring and reorganization plan that has been underway for some years,” a source told TOI.The new division is likely to eventually replace the “Uniform Force” of the Army’s specialized counter-insurgency Rashtriya Rifles (RR) that was rushed to eastern Ladakh after the multiple incursions by Chinese troops there in April 2020.In addition to the Panagarh-based 17 Mountain Strike Corps for the eastern sector, the Mathura-based 1 Strike Corps (each corps has 70,000-80,000 soldiers) was earlier also “rebalanced” to the LAC from its previous role on the western front with Pakistan, as was reported by TOI.There are as yet no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders as well as reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation.China has continued to strengthen its military positions and infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, with PLA troops continuing to be forward deployed with heavy weapon systems in large numbers.India, too, has maintained “mirror deployments”. In Arunachal, areas like Yangtse -- where the rival troops had clashed in Dec 2022 -- Asaphila and Subansiri river valley remain major flashpoints.During Prachand Prahar, long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, armed helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), loitering munitions, and space-based assets were employed to achieve total situational awareness and rapid target engagement.“Once simulated targets were identified, they were swiftly neutralised through coordinated strikes using fighter aircraft, long-range Pinaka rocket systems, medium artillery guns, swarm drones, kamikaze drones, and armed helicopters — all executed in an electronically contested environment that simulated modern battlefield conditions,” another officer said.This integrated tri-service exercise builds on the momentum of the `Poorvi Prahar’ exercise last Nov, which focused primarily on the integrated application of aviation assets. “Prachand Prahaar has now taken that concept further by validating a fully integrated approach to surveillance, command and control, and precision firepower across the three Services,” he said.","The Army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders. ‘Prachand Prahar (fierce attack)’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-Service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of Arunachal Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119613442,imgsize-904384,width-400,resizemode-4/119613442.jpg"

'BJP will not come into power in West Bengal in 100 years'

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah , while replying in the Lok Sabha on the Immigration and Foreigners Bill , 2025, on Thursday accused Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts by not providing land for fencing and showing mercy to infiltrators.He said, ""The fencing work of 450 km is pending because the West Bengal government is not giving land for it... Whenever the process of fencing is done, the ruling party workers indulge in hooliganism and religious sloganeering. The fencing work of 450 km of border has not been completed because the West Bengal government is showing mercy to the infiltrators.""Shah further accused the TMC government of aiding illegal immigrants by providing them with identity documents. ""Whether Bangladeshi infiltrators or Rohingyas, earlier they used to enter India through Assam when Congress was in power. Now they enter India through West Bengal where TMC is in power,"" he stated. ""Who issues them Aadhaar cards, citizenship?... All the Bangladeshis who have been caught have Aadhaar cards from 24 Parganas district. You (TMC) issue Aadhaar cards and they come to Delhi with voter cards... In 2026, the BJP government will be formed in West Bengal and we will put an end to this.""He also drew attention to the need for stricter immigration laws to safeguard national security and monitor foreign arrivals.Highlighting India's growing economic stature and the increasing influx of foreigners, Shah said, ""In the last ten years, India has become the fifth-largest economy. India has emerged as a bright spot among the world's largest economies. India has become a hub of manufacturing, and it is natural for people from all over the world to come to India.""However, he warned that infiltration for ulterior motives has also increased. ""The number of people taking refuge in India for personal gain and making the country unsafe has also increased... Be it Rohingyas or Bangladeshis, if they come to India to create unrest, strict action will be taken against them.""Defending the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, Shah said it was necessary for national security. ""Immigration is not an isolated issue. For the security of India, we must know who is entering our country, for how long, and for what reasons."" He added that the bill would introduce a structured system to monitor foreigners. ""With the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, we will establish a detailed and structured system to track every foreigner entering the country. This will help us develop the nation and monitor those coming for business. It will also allow us to keep a sharp eye on individuals who may pose a threat to our security.""Focusing on India's historical role in providing refuge, Shah said, ""India is a geo-cultural nation, not a geo-political nation. Persians came to India and are safe in the country today. The world's smallest minority community is safe only in India. Jews fled from Israel and stayed in India. During Prime Minister Modi's tenure, people from six oppressed communities from neighboring countries are taking refuge in the country through CAA.""Shah also made it clear that national security would remain a top priority. ""Those who pose a threat to national security will not be allowed to enter the nation. The nation is not a 'Dharamshala'... If someone comes to the nation to contribute to its development, they are always welcome.""Responding to Amit Shah's accusations against Mamata Banerjee, TMC MP Saugata Roy dismissed the claims as baseless. ""All the allegations of Union home minister Amit Shah are false,"" he said. Roy further criticized the central government for delays in installing border fencing, stating, ""They can't blame us for that."" He also asserted, ""BJP will not come into power in West Bengal in 100 years.""Following Shah's address, the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, was passed in the Lok Sabha.","Union home minister Amit Shah accused Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts.

Poll What is your primary concern regarding US visa appointment availability? Lack of transparency Fraudulent practices Reliability of agents Long wait times

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The US embassy in India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

"Healthy budgetary allocation must for infrastructure, health, education: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/healthy-budgetary-allocation-must-for-infrastructure-health-education-sc/articleshow/119623335.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday underlined the importance of healthy budgetary allocation by states for improving infrastructure, health and education and said mindless privatisation of these key sectors linked to human resource development would spell disaster.“It is high time for states to dedicate a part of their budget for development of infrastructure, health and education sectors. Otherwise, all these would be in private hands and commercially exploited. It will lead to the rich getting better amenities and the poor nothing,” a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said.The SC was also against selling state assets to fund development projects. “Selling assets to generate funds is not a solution. The political executive has a better understanding of the issues than us. So, they must take policy decisions in this regard,” the bench said. The court was hearing a dispute relating to 38 acres of prime land situated between Hyderabad and Secunderabad, which was purchased in 1964 by Kalyan Nagar Cooperative Society for construction of houses for its members. However, the land came to be encroached, and the society could never take possession of it.After hearing additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati for the Telangana govt, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy for the civic body and senior advocate Guru Krishna Kumar for the society, the bench found that most of the encroachers were slum-dwellers who had moved out after transferring their land to other people who had now built multi-storied houses there.The SC laid out the options to be weighed by the state: compensation to be paid by the authorities to society members at present market rate and recovery of the amount from the encroachers as regularisation and development fee; find alternative parcels of land for allotment to the society and to the encroachers and use the vacated land for commercial use or other projects that would get investment for the state.“Decision on this issue will require detailed deliberations on the suggested options. The state could also think of any better option,” the bench said.","The court was hearing a dispute relating to 38 acres of prime land situated between Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

The letter lamented that a deputy speaker has not been appointed since 2019, despite it being mandatory.It also criticised “intervention” by the Speaker’s office in the functioning of Parliamentary standing committees by “suggesting corrections in committee reports” — which compromises the autonomy of the panels. The letter said that opposition parties are not being consulted on the composition and chairmanship of Parliamentary committees panels and some “consultative committees” do not meet regularly. It slammed the denial of opportunity to Rahul Gandhi to speak in LS, in what appeared a reference to the Chair turning him down on Wednesday after the Speaker’s censure, and after PM Narendra Modi’s speech on Kumbh last week. “This breaks from past Parliamentary practices and diminishes the space for healthy debate in the House,” the letter said.Importantly, INDIA bloc said key ministries had been left out of budget discussions, “reducing Parliamentary oversight over financial decisions”. In an echo of its old grievance, the opposition said Rule 193, which allows debates on urgent public issues without voting, is rarely invoked now, “thereby avoiding accountability on pressing national matters”.",Joint opposition complains to Speaker Om Birla that leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was being repeatedly denied the opportunity to speak in contravention of parliamentary norms.

The two-time MLA contested the 2024 LS elections from prison and won the Baramulla seat in north Kashmir as an Independent, defeating heavyweights Omar Abdullah of National Conference and Sajad Gani Lone of People’s Conference.His plea in HC, filed Wednesday, challenges the financial burden imposed as a condition of his court-approved attendance in Parliament. Rashid’s counsel argued that the high cost was excessive and beyond his financial means.“Rashid is going to fulfil his constitutional duties and ought not to be prejudiced with such high costs,” according to the petition.HC had earlier granted Rashid permission to attend Lok Sabha session in custody until April 4, rejecting NIA’s concerns that he was a flight risk. However, the court mandated that he bear the costs of his transport and security.On March 26, the order allowing Rashid’s attendance was uploaded to court’s website. Later that evening, Tihar Jail authorities informed his legal team via email that he must pay Rs 1.45 lakh a day, amounting to Rs 8.74 lakh for six days.The matter was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela. The plea would be heard on Friday.Rashid has challenged a March 10 trial court order refusing him custody parole or interim bail to attend Lok Sabha proceedings. In Delhi HC, he withdrew his request for bail and instead sought permission to attend Parliament while remaining in custody.",Jailed Independent MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh from J&K has approached Delhi high court.

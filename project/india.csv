India plans to crank up Tejas production to stem IAF’s depletion in fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-crank-up-tejas-production-to-stem-iafs-depletion-in-fighters/articleshow/117967197.cms,"NEW DELHI: With US major General Electric promising the revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March onwards, India plans to progressively crank up production of the much-delayed indigenous light combat aircraft and stem the rapid depletion of fighter squadrons in IAF.Tejas-manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) already has three Tejas Mark-1A “ready in the flight line”, which will be fitted with the GE-F404 turbofan jet engines once they begin arriving in March. “HAL will have five Tejas Mark-1A jets and four trainers ready by March-April. If the GE engines begin coming, fitments can be done in a few days,” a top defence official told TOI.While integration of advanced electronic warfare systems and the Israeli radars on the Tejas Mark-1A has been completed, work is underway to soon also test-fire the indigenous Astra air-to-air missile from the single-engine jet, which undertook its first flight in March last year.The delivery of 99 GE-404 engines, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021 but has been delayed by almost two years, is all-important. GE has now promised to begin the delivery next month, with 12 engines to be delivered in 2026, and 20 every year thereafter, another official said.Depending on the supply of engines, HAL contends it can progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24 per year, with the third production line now functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru.“The first Tejas Mark-1A should roll out of the Nashik line in a month or two. HAL is also sub-contracting private companies to build wings, fuselages and the like. If they deliver, Tejas production can even go up to 30 per year,” he said.The wait, however, has been excruciating for IAF. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh just last month publicly expressed frustration at the huge delays in the 4th-generation Tejas fighters, while China recently displayed two new 6th-generation fighters.IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, will now hopefully be delivered in a couple of months. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.These 220 jets, along with 108 Tejas Mark-2 variants with more powerful engines, are critical for IAF, down to just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5 to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.HAL and GE, of course, are now conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.These engines, in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, will power Tejas Mark-2 fighters for a longer combat range and greater capacity to carry weapons than the existing fighters.In Aug 2022, the cabinet committee on security had cleared the development of Tejas Mark-2 with prototypes, flight testing and certification for over Rs 9,000 crore.While the long-delayed Tejas Mark-1 (13.5 tonne weight) was meant to replace obsolete MiG-21s, the Mark-2 variant (17.5 tonne) will succeed fighters like the Mirage-2000s, Jaguars and MiG-29s in IAF’s combat fleet.",General Electric has promised the revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March onwards. India plans to progressively crank up production of the much-delayed indigenous light combat aircraft and stem the rapid depletion of fighter squadrons in IAF.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117967178,imgsize-1214326,width-400,resizemode-4/117967178.jpg"
Delhi assembly elections: Hindu refugees from Pakistan vote for first time in capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-elections-hindu-refugees-from-pakistan-vote-for-first-time-in-capital/articleshow/117966460.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a polling booth in north Delhi's Majnu Ka Tilla, Reshma pressed the button on an electronic voting machine on Wednesday with a sense of pride as a smile spread across her face.For the first time in her life, the 50-year-old woman cast her vote - not just to choose a candidate, but for her family's future.Reshma is one of 186 Pakistani Hindu refugees who, after years of uncertainty, exercised their voting right for the first time in Delhi Assembly polls , marking a powerful moment in their journey from statelessness to citizenship.They all got Indian citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Dharamveer Solanki, president of Pakistani Hindu refugee community, expressed hope that their struggles would lessen.""Now, we won't have to constantly change our location. We will finally get permanent homes and a stable means of livelihood,"" he said.Solanki said that people from our community were so excited that they queued up outside the polling booth in Majnu Ka Tilla - a resettlement colony for the refugees.""I have lived here for 17 years but today, for the first time, I truly feel like I am part of Hindustan. Now I have hope that my children will get a better life,"" Chandrama said.For decades, thousands of Pakistani Hindus have sought refuge in India, fleeing religious persecution. Many settled in Delhi's Majnu Ka Tila, living in makeshift shelters, and taking up daily wage work. Yashoda, 27, was the first to receive Indian citizenship in her group.

But the voter participation is considered high as opposition parties AIADMK and BJP had boycotted the bypolls, leaving the field open to just two main contenders - DMK and NTK.The Milkipur bypolls were a political grudge match in UP's Hindutva heartland of Ayodhya, giving BJP a shot at redemption after a shock Lok Sabha defeat in Faizabad just over eight months ago and Samajwadi Party a chance to close the contest.The bypolls were necessitated by incumbent Awadhesh Prasad vacating the seat after being elected to Parliament from Faizabad, of which Milkipur is an assembly segment.

Delhi assembly polls: Freebies not enough to sway middle class?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-polls-freebies-not-enough-to-sway-middle-class/articleshow/117965708.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's ever-expanding middle class, instrumental in catapulting Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP party to power after Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement, forms the epicentre of a political tug-of-war that could give new shape to the city's political future. On Feb 8, when the votes are counted, it will become clear whether the middle class has distanced itself from Kejriwal or reaffirmed its support once again.The strategic importance of this voter segment was evident in both BJP and AAP making big overtures - from the central govt giving income tax benefits in the 2025 Union budget to AAP's distinct middle-class manifesto with a slew of measures for this section. While many middle-class residents appreciate AAP's contributions to education (via govt schools) and healthcare (through mohalla clinics) as well as its efforts to aid the underprivileged with free services, they also feel betrayed by unfulfilled promises, especially in delivering clean and efficient governance.""The middle class initially backed the Anna Hazare movement and then Kejriwal for his anti-corruption stance. We sought good governance, clean surroundings, decent roads and development, but witnessed nothing substantial,"" remarked Rakesh Kumar in Trilokpuri. ""What unfolded were scandals and ministers facing jail time. Free utilities might appeal to those living hand to mouth, but not to us.""Businessman Devendra Tyagi of Chhatarpur similarly lamented the decline in civic infrastructure. ""Development in our area occurred about 15 years ago under a proactive MLA. Now, the roads are deteriorating. Nothing new has been added. And the tug of war between Delhi and central govts only hurts the city.""Air quality is also a cause for distress for households. Orthopaedic Dr Rakesh, 56, of Dwarka was in a dilemma. ""There were only four voters in the queue before me and I still hadn't decided who to vote for,"" he said. ""Important issues like pollution, which affects my family directly, remain unaddressed by candidates. My son jokingly intends to vote for a candidate with a green chilli symbol.""Mahesh and Renuka Wanjare, residents of Kiran Garden, said no one addressed middle-class concerns. ""As an IT professional commuting to Noida, I face traffic problems. My wife, a homemaker, has her concerns about water supply,"" explained Mahesh. ""While the subsidies go to the poor, we struggle with high bills and living expenses, trapped in a cycle that politicians ignore."" Faizal, 42, an engineer, too talked of economic challenges. ""Inflation has made survival tough,"" he said.Raj Kumari, 60, voted in the hope that the incoming govt will create jobs for the young people. Harshvardhan Siddhartha, a dual degree holder seeking govt employment, too said, ""We need jobs to prevent skilled youth from suffering."" Vineet said in Seelampur that limited job opportunities weighed heavily on the community as did sanitation and roads.A group in C block in Krishna Nagar comprising Kuldeep Rai, 52, his wife Renu, 47, cousin Pavan Gupta, 48, Gupta's wife Dimple, 46, and their daughter Pratiksha, 24, had different electoral motivations. The women attributed their business downturn to BJP's policies, while the men held AAP accountable for the same. Nevertheless, they were equally dismayed by all parties shifting their focus to sops and freebies rather than paying attention to fundamental issues during campaigning.Sheerin Khaneja, an international NGO worker, considered intermittent water supply and broken roads while voting.","Delhi's ever-expanding middle class was instrumental in catapulting Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP party to power after Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement.

Return to bleak future

A family sat in mourning in Tahli village of Punjab's Hoshiarpur. Not for a life lost, but for a dream that died too soon. Kuljinder Kaur's voice quivered as she spoke of her husband Harwinder Singh, who was deported from US after risking everything to build a better life.""We paid Rs 42 lakh to an agent who promised safe passage,"" she said Wednesday, wiping away tears. ""We took the amount on loan, believing he would earn enough to repay it."" Harwinder is back, and the debt remained - a mountain impossible to scale. Villagers gathered around Kuljinder, offering comfort.Harwinder was not alone. Across Punjab's villages, families woke up to harsh reality of human trafficking networks operating in plain sight.In Darapur village, Prempal Singh Saini was reeling from the news that his son Sukhpal has been deported. Sukhpal, a hotel management graduate, had legally moved to Italy last year. But unknown to his family, he had attempted to reach US, only to be sent back.""I had no idea he was even on his way to the US,"" Prempal said. ""He must have thought he could earn more there. Now, he's back to nothing.""From Kapurthala to Hoshiarpur, eight families confronted similar fates. One of them, Lovepreet, a young mother, was deported with her 10-year-old son Prabhjot.The fallout from these deportations is more than just emotional - it is financial ruin. In Fatehgarh Sahib, Jeet Singh spoke of his son Jaswinder, who borrowed Rs 50 lakh to reach US. ""Now, with his return, we face nothing but debt,"" he said. ""We had sold land, borrowed from friends. How will we ever repay?""In Patiala, Ranjit Singh had similar hopes for his 18-year-old son Amrit. The family had five acres of land and a dream of a prosperous future. Now, after spending lakhs on a failed migration, Ranjit said: ""We will never think of sending him abroad again.""At Amritsar airport, the scene was a painful mix of relief and heartbreak. Swaran Singh stood among dozens of anxious relatives, waiting for his son Akashdeep, who had been deported. Akashdeep had first left for Dubai, where he worked as a truck driver. But, longing for a better future, he contacted an agent who promised him passage to US - for a staggering Rs 55 lakh. Singh sold almost all of his 2.5 acre to fund the journey.""My son never returned home from Dubai. He went to US,"" he said. ""Now, he's back, but we are left with nothing.""Nearby, a family waited for their daughter, who had attempted the same perilous journey. Her uncle, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared their story. ""She left for Spain in Jan, then moved to Mexico before trying to enter US. It was all arranged by the man she was to marry.""The groom's family had paid for her migration, expecting her to start a new life in America. ""But instead, she was sent back,"" the uncle rued.The heartbreak stretches beyond Punjab. In Gujarat, the dream of America has crumbled for the deportees, including Ketul Patel, a 40-year-old diamond worker from Patan.Five months ago, Ketul sold his house and borrowed Rs 50 lakh to take his family - his wife and two children - on a journey across borders. They arrived in US believing they had left their struggles behind. But US authorities had other plans.Back home, Ketul's mother Hiraba Patel struggled to accept the truth. ""We had already sold our farmland to buy a house in Surat,"" she said. ""Now, they have nothing left. What will they do?""In Mehsana, a Patel family awaits return of their son and his wife, who left in 2018. They believed their son's birth in US would ensure their safety. Instead, all three, husband, wife, and their American-born child, are being sent back. ""They took a Rs 75 lakh loan to get there,"" a relative said. ""They paid back some, but they still owe Rs 40 lakh. Now, they are broken, and keep talking about ending their lives.""(Inputs from IP Singh in Jalandhar, Bharat Khanna in Patiala, Vibhor Mohan & Yudhvir Rana in Amritsar, Ashish Chauhan in Ahmedabad)","Families across Punjab wake up to harsh reality of human trafficking networks.

NEW DELHI: Delhi on Wednesday votes for the assembly elections, with more than 1.5 crore eligible voters hitting the poll button to decide the national capital's politcal fate.A total of 699 candidates: 603 men, 95 women, and one third-gender candidate, are contesting for 70 assembly seats, after 2 weeks of intense campaigning.The polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.This high stake contest will witness the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) striving to retain its power in the region that it has dominated for the last two terms, against its rivals, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.Congress is also looking to achieve a strong comeback after a decade long exile from the capital.Many constituencies are set for fierce battles this time. AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal faces a tough challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both of whom are former MPs from different constituencies.Meanwhile, CM Atishi is up against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri, also a former MP, alongside Congress’s Alka Lamba.Aam Aadmi Party has pledged to expand its welfare schemes, offering free electricity and water, free bus travel for women, and improved education and healthcare, which it claims would save families around Rs 25,000 a month. It has also promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free medical treatment for senior citizens, and free bus travel for students.BJP, hoping to break its 30-year drought in Delhi assembly elections, has vowed to continue existing welfare schemes while introducing new ones, including a Rs 2,500 monthly stipend for women, increased pensions for senior citizens, Ayushman Bharat benefits, a monthly pension for small traders, paid internships for youth, and gas cylinders at Rs 500 for low-income households.Congress is attempting to reclaim a share of its traditional voter base from AAP and has promised Rs 8,500 per month for unemployed youth for a year, Rs 2,500 per month for women under the 'Pyari Didi Yojana,' an annual insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh, and zero electricity bills for consumers using up to 300 units.The Delhi election office has pledged to ensure a “free and fair” poll in the city. Delhi’s chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz informed that 1.1 civil officials- polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers, along with a pool of 60,000 security personnel have been deployed to achieve the purpose.Approximately 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 women will be casting their vote on Wednesday for whom 21,584 ballot units, more than 20,000 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been set up.Vas further added that all the voters standing in the queue at 6 pm would be allowed to cast their vote.Exit polls are surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations. They aim to predict the outcome of the elections before the official results are declared.However, the election commission has banned releasing exit polls till 6:30 pm on Wednesday, the day of voting. The ban applies to the Delhi elections and bypolls in Uttar Pradesh’s Milkipur constituency and Tamil Nadu’s Erode (East) seat. Citing Section 126A(1) of the R P Act, 1951, the notification stated, “The period between 7am and 6:30pm on 05.02.2025 (Wednesday) is hereby notified as the duration during which conducting, publishing, or publicising exit polls by any means, including print or electronic media, shall be prohibited.”According to the election commission, the exit poll results would be released after 6.30 pm on February 5.The exit poll predictions of 2025 Delhi assembly elections will be live streamed on different news channels, social media platforms, and YouTube channels.The result of the Delhi assembly elections would be announced on Satuday, 8th February.","Polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime.

US plane with illegal Indian migrants lands in Amritsar: Why Trump is using expensive military planes for deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-plane-with-illegal-indian-migrants-lands-in-amritsar-why-trump-is-using-expensive-military-planes-for-deportation/articleshow/117946953.cms,"Poll What Do You Think Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent Illegal Immigration? Address the Root Causes of Migration Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement

NEW DELHI: A US military aircraft transporting 104 alleged illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday. The flight, which originated from San Antonio, Texas, included 30 deportees from Punjab, 33 each from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh, as reported by news agency PTI citing sources.Footage showed a US military C-17 aircraft arriving at Shri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport around 1.30pm, shortly after which the deported Indian nationals disembarked.Th development comes as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up its aggressive stance on illegal immigration, with military planes now being used to deport illegal immigrants. The move, however, comes with a hefty price tag for American taxpayers.Military aircrafts, usually reserved for war zones and disaster relief, come with a significantly higher cost compared to the typical commercial charter flights used by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).According to Reuters, one of these military flights is estimated to cost at least $4,675 (Rs 4.07 lakh) per deportee, a figure that is more than five times the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial airline. In comparison, ICE deportation flights cost a far more affordable (Rs 55,000 per person).As per Reuters, Acting ICE director Tae Johnson told lawmakers during an April 2023 budget hearing that deportation flights cost $17,000 (about Rs 15 lakh) per flight hour for 135 deportees and typically lasted five hours.”A C-17 transport aircraft, which is used for these missions, costs an eye-watering $28,500 (Rs 24,90,559) per hour to operate, with the India-bound flight exceeding 12 hours in duration. This puts the total cost of one such mission into the millions of dollars, but as a US defense official pointed out, the exact cost is still being calculated.The official added that despite the high price, the priority is to act swiftly following Trump’s national emergency declaration on illegal immigration.Trump’s decision to use military planes has also sparked controversy abroad. Some countries, like Colombia and Mexico, have refused to let US military aircraft land to drop off deported migrants, with Mexico asserting its sovereignty and calling for coordination rather than unilateral action.While the deportation costs are steep, Trump’s tough rhetoric on immigration seems to be driving the use of military aircraft. As he stated in a recent speech, the use of such planes sends a strong message to illegal immigrants and the world: if you enter the US illegally, there will be serious consequences.“For the first time in history, we are locating and loading illegal aliens into military aircraft and flying them back to the places from which they came…We’re respected again, after years of laughing at us like we’re stupid people,” Trump had said.India, meanwhile, has time and again reiterated its stance against illegal immigration. The Ministry of External Affairs on Friday had stated it will facilitate the return of Indian nationals ""overstaying"" or residing without proper documentation in the United States or ""anywhere in the world.""","A US military aircraft transporting 104 alleged illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar.

400% surge in deportations from US



NEW DELHI: The US military plane carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon, marking the Donald Trump- administration's first crackdown on the country's migrants after assuming office. The official confirmation on the number of deportees are still awaited.A total of 30 deportees aboard the flight were residents of Punjab. Further, 33 deportees are each are from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh, PTI reporting citing sources. Earlier, there were reports of 205 illegal Indian immigrants being deported.The flight landed at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport amidst tight security from Punjab Police at 1.55pm.Amritsar airport director, deputy commissioner, commissioner of police, and CIF director had held a meeting and the police barricaded the cargo gate and another entry point at the airport as a part of the security measure.An official on Tuesday had confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India.This comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to the States, where he is also scheduled to meet Trump and hold talks with him.PM Modi and Trump had recently held a conversation where they discussed immigration among other matters of global peace and security.""Discussed immigration with Modi. India will do what is right when it comes to taking back illegal immigrants,"" Trump had said of the conversation.India had assured the US of cooperating in tackling illegal immigration by taking back the migrants who had entered America unlawfully.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians.

In 2024 alone, one Indian was deported every six hours as part of the US government's intensified immigration enforcement efforts.Bloomberg reported last month, citing sources, that both countries have identified around 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation. However, the actual number could be much higher, as the total remains uncertain.India contributes a small portion of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens accounting for approximately 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.","The flight landed at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport amidst tight security from Punjab Police at 1.55pm.

: After two consecutive terms, there may be signs of voter fatigue with AAP's governance. Criticisms regarding unfulfilled promises and governance challenges could lead some voters to seek change. Corruption allegations: Allegations of corruption against AAP leaders have surfaced frequently in recent months, potentially swaying undecided voters towards the BJP as they position themselves as a cleaner alternative.

Exit polls for the 2025 Delhi assembly elections on Wednesday predicted that the BJP will likely pull off a major upset and secure a majority in the legislative assembly. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will likely not get another term, predicted pollsters.The majority mark in the 70-seat Delhi assembly is 36 seats.The results of the elections will be declared on February 8.By 5pm, voter turnout was reported at 57.8% across Delhi's 70 constituencies, with expectations that the final turnout could be higher than the current figures, although it is anticipated to be lower than the 63% recorded in the previous assembly elections in 2020.High-profile campaigning by leaders from all major parties aimed to energise voters and encourage participation.The BJP organised numerous rallies and roadshows featuring prominent leaders, while AAP focused on its record of governance to appeal to its base.The Election Commission of India reported that polling took place across 13,766 stations, with nearly 699 candidates contesting for the assembly seats.The turnout is crucial as it can influence the final results; higher engagement often favors incumbent parties, while lower turnout can benefit opposition parties looking to capitalize on dissatisfaction.Since the emergence of AAP in 2013, exit polls have often struggled to accurately predict its performance.In past elections, pollsters underestimated AAP's strength significantly.For instance, in the 2020 elections, exit polls projected AAP to win around 54 seats, while it ultimately secured 62. Similarly, in 2015, predictions underestimated AAP's landslide victory when it won 67 out of 70 seats.The exit poll results for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections suggest a potentially transformative moment for Delhi's political landscape. If the BJP's predictions hold true, it would signify not only a return to power but also an end to AAP's dominance in the capital after a decade-long tenure.As counting day approaches on February 8, all eyes will be on how accurately these exit polls predict actual outcomes and what this means for future electoral contests.Several factors may have contributed to the predicted outcomes reflected in the exit polls:","BJP has built a formidable grassroots network that enabled effective voter outreach and mobilization.

Lifetime Pass (₹30,000) – Long-Term Savings Annual Pass (₹3,000) – More Flexible

NEW DELHI: In yet another relief to the middle class and private car owners who frequently use national highways , govt is likely to soon offer the option of purchasing an ‘ annual toll pass ’ with a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 for unlimited use. It will also offer car owners the option to purchase a ‘lifetime pass’ for 15 years with an upfront payment of Rs 30,000.Sources said the proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry . TOI has also learnt that the ministry is looking at the option of tweaking the base toll rate per km for private cars to give relief to highway users. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags.At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details. This pass is priced at Rs 340 per month, that works out to Rs 4,080 for a year. “So, the offer of Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel across NH network for the entire year is much less than what people pay for free travel at one plaza. This would be optional and detailed analysis has shown that this can be a preferred choice,” said a source.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said that his ministry is working on the plan to offer passes for car owners. Sources said the ministry is looking at it as one solution to several issues, including the growing resentment against toll plazas within municipal limits, toll gates at less than 60 km interval and violence at plazas.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 55,000 crore of 2023-24, private cars had a share of barely Rs 8,000 crore. The trend of toll transaction and collection also shows that while 53% of the transactions were for private cars, their share in toll collection is barely 21%. Moreover, while nearly 60% of traffic are private vehicles at toll plazas between 6 am to 10 pm, the distribution of commercial vehicles are almost even throughout day and night.Sources said there will be no loss of earning due to the passes over a period of few years, though initially the NHAI has to forgo some revenue.","The proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry.

The majority mark in the 70-member Delhi assembly is 36.Bharatiya Janata Party celebrated the exit polls predictions and claimed that the ""exact"" results on February 8 will be even better.Reacting to the predictions, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said, ""The exit polls I saw right now, I feel like our exact polls (results) are going to be better than exit polls...the reaction we saw among people, BJP is coming to power (in Delhi). It is BJP's homecoming. I thank the people of Delhi.""BJP candidate from New Delhi assembly seat Parvesh Verma also hailed the predictions and said, ""It is certain that Lotus will bloom on February 8. We will give good governance, clean Yamuna and employment in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal is confident that he is losing.""Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva also reacted to the predictions and said that the voters wanted change and a corruption-free government.""People of Delhi have made up their minds, and they want change and a corruption-free government. Our workers have fought with full dedication against this corrupt government. I'm sure that 'AAP-da' is going, and the BJP is coming to power in Delhi.""On the other hand, AAP rejected the exit poll results for the Delhi assembly election and said that the pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance, while the BJP termed the predictions an assertion of people's urge for change.AAP's national spokesperson Reena Gupta claimed that exit polls have historically underestimated the Arvind Kejriwal-led party but in actual results, the party gained several times more than these projections.""You look at any exit poll -- whether in 2013, 2015 or 2020 -- the AAP was always shown getting a smaller number of seats. But it got a greater number of seats in the actual results,"" Gupta said.She claimed that the people of Delhi have voted for the AAP in large numbers and asserted that the party is going to register a ""historic"" victory, with Kejriwal becoming the chief minister for a fourth time.Meanwhile, Congress refrained from reacting to the predictions and said that it would wait for the results.Candidate from the New Delhi constituency, Sandeep Dikshit, said, ""Let's wait for the February 8. We fought well.""According to the People's Insight exit poll, the NDA is likely to get 40 to 44 seats, the AAP 25 to 29 seats, and the Congress 0-1 seats.The P-Marq exit poll predicted 39-49 seats for the BJP and its allies, 21-31 seats for AAP and 0-1 for the Congress.The JVC exit poll said the BJP and allies would get 39-45, the AAP 22-31 seats and the Congress 0-2.Similarly, the Poll Diary predicted 42-50 seats for the BJP and allies, while giving the AAP 18-25 seats, 0-2 for the Congress and 0-1 for others.Matrize exit poll predicted a close contest, giving the BJP-led NDA 35-40 seats, while the AAP was said to get 32 to 37 seats. The survey gave Congress 0-1 seats.The DV Research exit polls predicted 26-34 seats for the AAP, and 36-44 for the BJP and allies, giving zero seats to the Congress.In the 70-member Delhi assembly, 36 is the majority mark. The AAP currently has 62 MLAs, the BJP has eight, and the Congress none.The Delhi assembly results will be declared on February 8.

"Delhi elections exit polls: Poll of polls predict shock AAP exit, return of BJP to Delhi after 27 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-exit-polls-poll-of-polls-predict-shock-aap-exit-return-of-bjp-to-delhi-after-27-years/articleshow/117953759.cms,"Several exit polls conducted on Wednesday forecasted a win for the BJP over the ruling AAP in the Delhi assembly elections, while Congress was expected to gain little compared to previous elections. However, two exit polls indicated a potential victory for AAP, with several others suggesting a tight race favouring the BJP.A poll of polls suggests that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will regain power after 27 years, with predictions suggesting it may secure around 40 seats in the 70-member assembly. This would allow them to surpass the majority mark of 36 seats required to form a government.In contrast, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has held power for two consecutive full terms, is forecasted to win approximately 30 seats. Meanwhile, the Congress party is expected to struggle significantly, with projections indicating they may secure only 0 to 1 seat.The Election Commission will release official results following the counting on February 8. Exit polls are predictions made by election survey agencies based on voter interviews immediately after they cast their votes, but they can differ significantly from actual outcomes. In the 2020 Delhi elections, many exit polls miscalculated their forecasts.Among those predicting a BJP victory, People's Pulse estimated that the NDA could secure between 51 and 60 seats, while AAP might obtain 10-19 seats, with Congress failing to win any. People's Insight suggested the NDA would get 40-44 seats, AAP 25-29 seats, and Congress 0-1 seat. The P-Marq poll projected 39-49 seats for BJP and allies, 21-31 for AAP, and 0-1 for Congress. JVC's exit poll indicated BJP and allies would achieve 39-45 seats, AAP 22-31 seats, and Congress 0-2. Poll Diary anticipated 42-50 seats for BJP and allies, while assigning AAP 18-25 seats and Congress 0-2. Chanakya Strategies forecasted BJP and allies at 39-44 seats, AAP at 25-28, and Congress at 2-3.Two surveys predicted AAP's success: Wee Preside estimated AAP at 46-52 seats against BJP's 18-23 and Congress's 0-1; Mind Brink Media projected AAP at 44-49 seats with BJP at 21-25 and Congress at 0-1.Matrize suggested a close contest with BJP-led NDA at 35-40 seats and AAP at 32-37, giving Congress 0-1 seats.DV Research anticipated AAP would secure between 26-34 seats while BJP and allies would get 36-44, again predicting zero for Congress.In the Delhi assembly of 70 members, a majority requires 36 seats. Currently, AAP holds 62 MLAs, BJP has eight, and Congress has none. The assembly elections took place on Wednesday, with results due on February 8. Approximately 58% of Delhi's 1.55 crore voters participated by 5pm on Wednesday.Several AAP leaders dismissed the exit polls' predictions, while BJP officials expressed confidence in their anticipated victory.The political dynamics in Delhi have shifted dramatically since the rise of AAP in 2013, which disrupted Congress's long-standing dominance in the region. The last two elections saw AAP winning decisively, with substantial majorities. However, recent trends suggest that voter sentiment may be changing, possibly influenced by various factors including governance issues and allegations of corruption against AAP leaders.Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy in predicting outcomes in Delhi elections. For instance, while they correctly anticipated AAP's victories in previous elections, they often underestimated the scale of those wins. In 2015 and 2020, exit polls projected closer contests than what ultimately transpired.","Several exit polls conducted on Wednesday forecasted a win for the BJP over the ruling AAP in the Delhi assembly elections.

US Deports 200+ Illegal Indian Migrants Using Military Aircraft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-illegal-indian-migrants-in-military-aircraft/articleshow/117925897.cms,"Poll What Do You Think Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent Illegal Immigration? Address the Root Causes of Migration Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement

NEW DELHI: In the first such operation of its kind involving India since the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India. Anonymous US officials were quoted as saying dozens had been deported, and unconfirmed reports put the number of deportees north of 200, but there was no confirmation about the same by either country.In fact, there was no official acknowledgement at all of the flight by Indian authorities till late in the evening. The American embassy here, without sharing any details about the flight, said the US is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. “These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,” said the spokesperson.Official sources here said India’s position on illegal migration had not changed and it will continue to accept those who illegally entered the US, after verifying their Indian origin. The people who are returning, all verified Indian nationals, are among the thousands of Indians identified for deportation under the Biden administration.An early morning report by Reuters from Washington said the C-17 aircraft had departed for India with migrants aboard but would not arrive for at least 24 hours. The Punjab government was preparing for its landing in Amritsar on Wednesday morning. The Indian government did not confirm if the plane was going to land there but American journalists quoted US officials as saying that the aircraft was on its way to the Indian border city after a stop in Guam.The development also comes days ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US for his first bilateral meeting with Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. Trump had raised the issue of illegal migration with Modi and later said the India PM would do what’s right on the issue.While India has been accepting illegal migrants from the US for years, including under the first Trump administration, it has rarely, if ever, used a military aircraft to deport Indian nationals to India. The last time US authorities deported a significant number of illegals to India was in October last year but that was carried out through a large frame charter flight. Colombia recently turned away 2 US military deportation aircraft, saying the US was treating its nationals like criminals, but quickly backed down after Trump threatened to retaliate with punitive trade tariffs.While India is unlikely to be as sensitive as some of the Leftist Latin American leaders about receiving citizens in a military aircraft from the US, a country it has robust defence cooperation with, the Indian government will closely follow how Indian nationals returning are handled by American authorities in deportation flights. This is also the farthest that a US deportation plane has travelled since Trump’s return as such flights were limited till now to central and South American countries. Many of these illegal migrants were reported to have landed in their respective countries in handcuffs. While Mexico has insisted on accepting its citizens only in civilian planes, Brazil complained about “flagrant disregard’’ of human rights in US deportation flights.A New York Times report on January 3, quoting defence officials, said military planes have rarely been used in the past by the US for deportation. Most deportations in the past couple of weeks have been through nonmilitary planes and only 6 military flights have been used for the same till the end of Trump’s second week in office. Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Peru are the only countries to have received military flights till the end of the last week.","The US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India.

"Delhi assembly elections 2025: As turnout dips, all eyes on Saturday score; votes cast lowest since 2008",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-elections-2025-as-turnout-dips-all-eyes-on-saturday-score-votes-cast-lowest-since-2008/articleshow/117964440.cms,"(PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The fate of three major political players and 699 candidates is now sealed with over 60.42% (data updated at 11.30pm) of the 1.56 crore voters of Delhi coming out to cast their votes on Wednesday for electing their representatives for the 70-member assembly in the capital.The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes. Nearly 66% of the total electorate exercised their franchise in 2013 while in the subsequent election in 2015, a record high voting of 67.5% was witnessed.The 2020 polls, however, saw a dip of nearly five percentage points with 62.8% exercising their franchise.The turnout this time is 1.8 percentage points more than that of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections – 58.6% – conducted during the peak of summer in May.The Election Commission has, however, said the turnout figures are provisional and will be updated in the next couple of days.ECI director Anuj Chandak said in press statement that near the close of polling, officials have to prepare several statutory and non-statutory forms, seal the EVMs, give copies of VTR (voter turnout) data in Form 17C to the polling agents and then move the EVMs to the designated centres under security.""Thereafter, updated VTR starts continuously reflecting on the VTR APP again from 7pm, as and when the data is updated by ROs (returning officers) when these polling parties return from the polling stations,"" he added.Chandak explained that at times some polling parties fail to submit their documents on poll day which may lead to further update of the turnout numbers after scrutiny of statutory papers and consideration of a repoll, if any.The relatively poor turnout went against the general perception that the city's aware electorate sets an example for the rest of the country. A senior Delhi election official accepted that the turnout was indeed less than expected but added that one should wait for the final turnout figures before looking for reasons. Accepting that the voter turnout was less than what they had expected, election officials said it was too early to look for reasons.""There are several factors that determine voter turnout, and on most occasions those are political. Let's wait for the final numbers before making a comment on it,"" Singh said. It was a triangular contest with AAP, BJP and Congress running an intense campaign in the run-up to the polls.Seeking a third consecutive term, AAP showcased the work done in health, education, water and other sectors besides providing free power and water to frugal consumers and free ride to women in public transport. It promised more welfare schemes for women, senior citizens and other sections of society.BJP, which has been out of office for nearly 26 years, promised to continue the welfare schemes already being run in the capital and also proposed several new free initiatives for various sections of society. With its govt at the Centre, it promised better development projects with a double-engine govt.Congress, while reminding people of the developmental work done by the Sheila Dikshit-led govt in 1998-2013 came out with a manifesto which mentioned various free schemes and plans for all sections.Going by the interim data, Muslim-dominated Mustafabad recorded the highest turnout at 69%, which was more than what was recorded in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls when 66.8% people had cast their votes. However, the constituency recorded a turnout nearly 1.8% less than the 2020 assembly polls, which had witnessed 70.8% voting.Seelampur recorded the second-highest turnout of 68.7%, followed by the reserved constituency of Seemapuri where 65.3% votes were cast. Mehrauli witnessed the lowest turnout of 53% followed by Model Town at 53.4%. The polling started at 7am and the first two hours witnessed a decent turnout of 8.1%. By 11am, almost 20% voting had occurred. That increased to 33.3% at 1pm and 46.5% at 3pm. As per the ECI's voter turnout mobile app, 57.7% turnout was recorded by 5pm with one more hour to go.While the polling booths were largely empty during the first two hours of the day when the air was nippy, officials said queues had started forming by 9am. Several polling booths, especially in the outer Delhi areas, saw queues in the evening, indicating that the final voting percentage may increase by a few more points.""Those who reached the polling stations before the official time of voting to end were given a paper slip.All such voters were allowed to vote,"" said an official.Among the prominent candidates who contested the polls were chief minister Atishi; AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal; former deputy CM Manish Sisodia; ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj, Imran Hussain, Mukesh Ahlawat and Raghuvinder Shokeen; BJP's Vijender Gupta; former MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma; former ministers Kailash Gahlot, Raaj Kumar Anand, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Rajkumar Chauhan; Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav; Sandeep Dikshit; and Haroon Yusuf.The votes will be counted on Feb 8, and if a political party gets a clear majority, the govt will be formed by Feb 11.Election Commission officials claimed that voting remained peaceful across the city and no cases of violence were reported from anywhere.""All 70 assembly constituencies of the National Capital Territory of Delhi went to polls today in a peaceful and festive atmosphere. Voters were delighted with the seamless polling process and facilities at the polling stations,"" Chandak said.""Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, along with election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, maintained a thorough and exhaustive oversight of the ongoing elections ahead of and during the polling day to ensure seamless, smooth and peaceful elections,"" he added.","The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes.

Delhi assembly elections: BJP hopes 27-year exile coming to an end as exit polls give it edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-elections-bjp-hopes-27-year-exile-coming-to-an-end-as-exit-polls-give-it-edge/articleshow/117964410.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two exit polls released on Wednesday gave BJP an edge over AAP in the Delhi assembly polls, one of the four analysed here gave the incumbent a third consecutive decisive mandate and another gave BJP an even clearer win. If the BJP does win, it will end a near three-decade drought - 27 years, to be precise - for the saffron party in the state.The Matrize poll estimated that BJP would likely cross the majority mark, but only just, with a projected range of 35-40 seats in the 70-member House. P-Marq gave the saffron party a somewhat better range of 39-44 seats while People's Pulse put the figure at 51-60, a sweep nearly as comprehensive as AAP's in the last two assembly polls in 2015 and 2020.In contrast, WeePreside predicted AAP would win 46-52 seats, with BJP at best getting 23 seats. All four polls put the Congress tally at no more than one seat and even that was not a sure shot. For Congress, which was in office in Delhi for 15 years before AAP unseated it, that would mean its hopes of a significant revival in the national capital would once again be dashed.For AAP, a defeat at this stage where its most prominent leaders are facing cases, would be a body blow. If, on the other hand, BJP were to lose again, it will feel it missed out on a real opportunity to regain office in a small but politically high-profile territory.A few established pollsters like Axis My India, CVoter and Today's Chanakya, some of which have at various points in the recent past acquired a reputation for being accurate in their predictions, did not release any exit poll results on Wednesday. TOI learns that they are likely to reveal findings of exit polls or post-poll surveys in the next day or two.","Two exit polls released on Wednesday gave BJP an edge over AAP in the Delhi assembly polls.

While the campaign material was seized, police rejected the allegations of cash distribution and charges of fake voting.In the morning, senior AAP functionary Manish Sisodia alleged that money was being distributed from a house in Jangpura. He also shared a video of the purported act on X. DCP (South East) Ravi Kumar Singh, however, said a flying surveillance team was called to the spot to verify the allegations, but nothing was found.""We received a complaint... the FST team also responded to it and the allegation was verified, nothing of this kind was found,"" he said.AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh alleged that a leader of the Valmiki community, Harish, was ""arrested"" at South Avenue police station. He also claimed that a former chaupal head of the Valmiki community, Uday Gill, was also kept at the police station without any reason. ""Nobody is ready to tell us the reason for the same.... I have spoken with the election observer, DCP and SHO. But Uday Gill has not been released yet,"" he added.Police, however, claimed Harish was detained on a complaint of ""distributing freebies and transporting voters to polling booths"".

Chaos erupted at Angelic Convent School in Maujpur after a voter, Poonam, claimed someone cast a vote in her name.

People have been brought in from UP's Loni to vote in large numbers without proper photo verification. There are women in burqas whose identities aren't being checked,"" a BJP worker alleged.Police denied the charges, pointing to security deployed in the area. Additional police and paramilitary forces were also deployed, it said.Saurabh Bharadwaj, AAP candidate from Greater Kailash, claimed police barricaded Chirag Dilli area, preventing people from voting. He shared a video on X showing a woman sitting alone in an auto- near a barricade, alleging the obstruction was placed to prevent access to the polling station. DCP (South) Ankit Chauhan said only the elderly and those who can't walk were allowed to go to booths in vehicles while others were stopped 200 metres before the polling station.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva alleged that AAP had stooped to ""fake voting"" as it was rattled by its ""imminent defeat"". He urged people to be wary of AAP's ""manipulations"".The New Delhi district election office said in a post on X that some alleged instances of relievers of polling agents not being allowed inside polling booths were reported by political parties. ""On-ground verification revealed that polling agents inside were unwilling to come out.

AMRITSAR/CHANDIGARH: A US military C-17 Globemaster aircraft landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians , grounding their 'American dream' that led them to stake their all in its pursuit.The Union govt didn't rule out more deportation flights from the US, saying all repatriated citizens whose antecedents had been verified - like in the past under the Biden administration and during Donald Trump's previous stint as President - would be ""accepted back"".Sources said this was the first known instance of the US deploying a military aircraft to send deported immigrants from India back home. On why a C17 was used, a US embassy spokesperson only said the military was supporting the new Trump administration's efforts to expedite the removal of illegal migrants globally. When illegal Indian immigrants were last deported in Oct 2024, US authorities had used a charter flight.The arrivals in Amritsar included 25 women and 13 children. Although no official data was put out, the state-wise break-up based on multiple reports is: Haryana 35, Gujarat 33, Punjab 31, three from UP and 2 from Maharashtra.On speculation about the deportees being handcuffed, a Punjab govt official said, ""Some of them said barring the kids, they were made to wear handcuffs during the flight. I can't confirm it, though."" The military aircraft, which took off from San Antonio in Texas arrived in Amritsar at 1.55pm and returned around 5.15pm.Several of the deportees told a government official at the airport that they were picked up ""at the US-Mexico border about 10 days ago"". Some said they travelled to the US from the UK.Sources involved in the clearance process at the airport said deportees from Punjab and Haryana were sent home by road. Those from Gujarat and other states were scheduled to take flights late Wednesday. A senior police officer said investigators would look into who helped the deportees reach the US and how much money they paid to these illegal immigration agents.""They feel betrayed by whomever they gave money to. A Gujarati family claims to have paid Rs 1 crore to reach the US,"" another official said. An uncle of a youth from a border village of Amritsar said the family sold one-and-a-half acres of land and spent a little over Rs 42 lakh to send his nephew abroad. ""He reached the US via Mexico only a few months ago,"" he said.Charanjit Singh, a retired police inspector in Punjab, was at the airport to receive his grandson Ajaydeep Singh, a resident of Amritsar Cantt. He said the young man was living in a camp before being deported. On whether families of all the deportees were aware about the circumstances of their return, an official said, ""Some requested us not to inform their families.""Special counters had been set up at the airport to process formalities for the deportees. Several police vehicles and buses were sent to the cargo terminal and used to transport the deportees back to their hometowns.","104 deported Indians landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians.

Is India losing the spring in its step?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-india-losing-the-spring-in-its-step/articleshow/117963287.cms,"DEHRADUN: As Jan gave way to Feb, India found itself in what meteorologists describe as an ""early spring-like"" phase, the product of prolonged dry weather and unseasonably high temperatures.According to IMD, Jan 2024 was the third-warmest on record, with average mean temperature of 18.9°C, and the fourth-driest since 1901, making it one of the most arid winter months in recent history.Traditionally, March and April fell into the spring season, but as Feb unfolds with temperatures that feel more like April, data collated by global weather-watching agencies suggest that what was once a predictable passage from winter to summer is increasingly being rewritten by the forces of climate change . This trend, experts say, is more than an anomaly - it is indicative of a gradual but fundamental shift in India's climate, one that could soon render the country's traditional spring season obsolete.Professor Anjal Prakash, research director at Bharti Institute of Public Policy at Indian School of Business (Hyderabad) and an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Cimate Change, a UN body) author, warned of the wider implications of a disappearing spring. ""With shifting climate patterns, it is becoming increasingly evident that the cherished spring season, once a hallmark of renewal and agricultural vitality, is under threat,"" he said.Prakash added that these changes are disrupting traditional weather cycles, shortening spring, and altering its characteristic temperate conditions. ""The impact extends beyond climate-agriculture, biodiversity, and cultural practices deeply rooted in seasonal transitions are at risk. Addressing this requires immediate, coordinated action to mitigate these effects and preserve the rhythm of our seasons,"" he cautioned.IMD's outlook for this month predicts below-normal rainfall across the country, particularly in northern India, while both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain above average. ""We may see an early or even no spring season at all,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet. ""Weak Western Disturbances in Dec and Jan led to less snowfall and fewer winter rains. Additionally, humid and warm winds from the southwest and southeast blocked cold northerly winds, pushing minimum temperatures higher than usual.""The Himalayan region has been particularly affected, with historically low snowfall. Mukhtar Ahmed, director of the regional meteorological centre in Srinagar, J&K, said winters are shrinking rapidly. ""There is no snowfall here, and maximum temperatures have been 6-8°C above normal for three weeks. Winters, which traditionally lasted from Oct to March, are now confined to just Dec and Jan,"" he said.European think tank Climate Central has also highlighted a long-term trend - Feb warming rates have risen significantly in recent decades, causing a sudden shift from winter to summer. World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has already confirmed 2024 as the warmest year on record, with temperatures about 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. In northern India, winter is giving way to summer abruptly, eliminating the gradual transition of spring.This winter season has seen severe precipitation deficits across the Himalayas. Since Jan 1, Uttarakhand recorded an 86% shortfall, followed by J&K (80%), Himachal Pradesh (73%) and Sikkim (82%). IMD data shows northwest and eastern India - barring eastern Rajasthan - recorded deficient to significantly deficient rainfall, while central India saw a 96% rainfall deficit in Jan.","As Jan gave way to Feb, India found itself in what meteorologists describe as an ""early spring-like"" phase. This is the product of prolonged dry weather and unseasonably high temperatures. Jan 2024 was the third-warmest on record, with average mean temperature of 18.9°C.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117963611,imgsize-1129258,width-400,resizemode-4/117963611.jpg"

Handcuffed and humiliated': Congress

NEW DELHI: The US military plane carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon, marking the Donald Trump-administration's first crackdown on the country's migrants after assuming office.The deportees from Punjab and Haryana were taken to their respective hometowns in police vehicles after completion of all formalities.After reaching his home town, one of the deported Indian immigrants, Jaspal Singh said, ""We were handcuffed and legs were chained. These were opened at the Amritsar airport.""He recounted that, at first, they were unaware they were being taken to India. ""We thought we were being taken to another camp. Then a police officer told us that we were being taken to India. We were handcuffed and our legs were chained. The handcuffs and chains were taken off at the Amritsar airport,"" he added.He also claimed he was deceived by a travel agent who had promised him legal entry into the US. ""I had asked the agent to send me after getting a proper US visa. But he deceived me,"" he said, adding that the deal with the agent was finalised at Rs 30 lakh.Jaspal claimed that he reached Brazil by air in July last year. He said he was promised that the next leg of journey, to the US, would be by air too. However, he was ""cheated"" by his agent, who forced him to cross the border illegally.After staying for six months in Brazil, he crossed the border to the US, but was arrested by the US Border Patrol. He was kept there in custody for 11 days and then sent back home, said Jaspal.Earlier, Jaspal's cousin Jasbir Singh said, ""We came to know about his deportation through the media on Wednesday morning"".Jaspal said he was shattered with deportation. ""A huge sum was spent. The money was borrowed.""About the deportations, he said, ""These are issues of governments. When we go abroad for work, we have big dreams for a better future for our families. Those have now been shattered.""Earlier in the day, senior Congress leader Pawan Khera questioned Modi government citing images of Indian nationals in handcuffs facing deportation from the USOn the social media platform X, Khera drew parallels to a 2013 incident during the UPA government's tenure, when Indian diplomat Devyani Kobragade faced handcuffing and strip-searching in the US.His X post read, ""Looking at the pictures of Indians getting handcuffed and humiliated while being deported from the US saddens me as an Indian. I remember in December of 2013, an Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade was handcuffed and strip searched in America. Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh registered a strong protest with US Ambassador Nancy Powell.""""The UPA govt retaliated sharply. Leaders like Ms Meira Kumar, Sushil Kumar Shinde & Rahul Gandhi refused to meet the US Congressional delegation (George Holding, Pete Olson, David Schweikert, Rob Woodalland Madeleine Bordallo) that was visiting India at that time. Dr Manmohan Singh termed the US action 'deplorable'. Govt of India withdrew several perks given to the US embassy, including imports of food and alcohol at concessional rates by embassy staff.

: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Washington a week from now to meet a US President consumed with grand geo-political ideas and theater, with little bandwidth for the small stuff and minor details. While mollifying Trump on trade issues by reducing tariffs and buying more US products will be part of the Indian approach, Trump's tectonic shake-out proposals in the middle-east suggest he's ready for bold, even outrageous, geo-political gambles, something that sits uneasily with an Indian establishment that is very cautious and circumspect in this regard.Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House after he assumed office for a second term on January 20, a stark reminder of the MAGA-infused President alliance and partnership priorities. Although not a formal treaty ally -- not that he values any alliance -- India is a key piece in Trump's scheme of things. Officials previewing the visit say big ticket announcements on military purchases, energy (including nuclear) supplies, and artificial intelligence collaboration are on the cards in keeping with the new expectations.Visiting Indian PMs typically place great emphasis on engaging the US Congress during such visits, but American lawmakers have been reduced to supine bystanders in the imperial Trump II regime. Instead, the most important interlocutor in Washington DC after the US President is his unelected tech surrogate Elon Musk, who also happens to be a long-time Modi supporter. Sources said an ""El-Mo"" meeting has not been pencilled in yet during the one-day (February 13) visit, but it is very much on the cards given their long engagement going back to 2015, when Modi first visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.The schedule for Modi's visit is still being worked out but sources said he is expected to arrive in Washington DC late on February 12 and depart early on February 14, with all of February 13 committed to bilateral meetings at the White House, with a possible dinner to be hosted by the US President. Musk, who is literally camping out at the Old Executive Office Building next door, will almost certainly be present at the meetings or call on Modi at the Willard Hotel on the other side of the White House.Trump will have most of his cabinet nominees confirmed by the time Modi arrives, along with Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel, both with strong ties to the Modi dispensation that is expected to spur cooperation in intelligence field. The only missing piece will be a new US ambassador to India, which Trump has been unable to fill given that many fat cat donors and MAGA principals are said to have given New Delhi a pass because of pollution issues.Scuttlebutt in the US capital that Trump daughter Ivanka was interested in the job has no basis, sources said, given that she has three young children. Trump has named Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner as the US ambassador to France and another in-law, Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, as Middle East advisor.","Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House.

NEW DELHI: Learning from the “rutting” (permanent depressions) at several portions of the Mumbai Expressway’s Sohna-Dausa section last year, which attracted huge criticism, the NHAI has directed detailed testing of the stone mastic asphalt (SMA) material used in other highway projects.Deficiency in the quality of SMA used on this section was identified as one the major reasons for the expressway getting damaged less than two years after its inauguration. Several projects, including the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway , have been constructed or are being constructed using 50 mm SMA — a gap-graded hot mix asphalt that contains a large percentage of coarse aggregate (over 70%) and bitumen filler mastic.This is used since it is strong, durable, and resistant to deformation. The investigation into the Sohna-Dausa stretch had found that the highway builder had used SMA having 13 mm aggregate, while 19 mm aggregate was preferable.The probe also found that rutting mostly developed during the summer when the temperature of the pavement was more than 70 degrees Celsius. An expert panel had observed that the grade of bitumen used could not sustain high temperatures and recommended use of higher-grade bitumen. It recommended the removal of the SMA layers in stretches where the average rut depth was more than 10 mm, and re-lay the stretch with 50 mm SMA, having 19 mm aggregate with higher quality bitumen.Officials said the work has been completed. “Since this incident came to our notice, we are carrying out tests across all other stretches where SMA has been used to detect if there are similar issues,” said an official.In a circular, the NHAI has said “some incidences” have been reported regarding the “deficiency in quality of SMA” on completed projects”. It added that agencies must ensure that technology (SMA) is implemented in a right manner so that it can survive.In case, SMA or DBM, which is often used as a base course for roads, fails in compliance or has a tendency of premature distress or rutting, then more samples from other locations will be sent for testing. Subsequently, the rectification will be carried out in consultation with domain experts.","The NHAI has directed detailed testing of the stone mastic asphalt (SMA) material used in other highway projects.

Agents charged over 40 lakhs per person to send the children via this route. Now, if the children are deported, the families will be ruined.Talking to TOI, Suresh Kumar, a retired army personnel and a native of Khark Bhura village in Uchana town of Jind district, is at a loss for words after his son Rohit Sharma (21), was deported in first batch.""My son went to the UK on January 20, 2024, after completing his graduation.

I haven’t been in touch with my son for the past 15 days, and I don’t know what has happened to him. I am unable to do anything at the moment, but I take solace in knowing that he is coming back alive. Once he returns, I will speak to him and advise him to settle his life in India,"" he said.Gurudev Singh, a resident of Jind, shared that his son went to England two years ago, but after insisting, he requested money and somehow made his way to the USA. They spent nearly 50 lakhs to send him. Now, due to Trump's actions, everyone is worried. The whole family can't sleep at night. Everyone is concerned about what will happen next. ""I have only one son, but out of his persistence, I sent him to the US. Now, children being sent back in handcuffs, it is devastating, and the family is worried about how they will recover the money they invested,"" Singh said.Singh explained that unemployment in Haryana is at its peak, and young people can't find jobs. They are hopeless and disheartened. That's why they want to go abroad. ""If the government ensures good employment opportunities and industries create new jobs in India, the youth will not go abroad.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday lauded the appointment of over 2800 youths in Tripura government, noting how the Manik Saha regime in state is providing jobs with full transparency and without any discrimination or corruption, unlike the earlier Left govt that only provided employment to communist “party cadres”.Addressing the programme for distribution of over 2800 appointment letters in Tripura govt through video conference, Shah said Saha govt has ensured a new beginning in the lives of 2,807 youths of the state by offering them 2,437 multi-tasking staff positions and 370 health department positions on Wednesday. With their appointment letter, he said, the 2,807 beneficiaries had become part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign for a developed Tripura and India.Highlighting the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to keep the entire northeast on the path of development, Shah said thanks to initiatives taken in the region over the past 10 years, the northeast once known for insurgency, infiltration, blockades, drugs, arms smuggling, corruption, and ethnic tensions “is now known for development, connectivity, infrastructure, education, investment, and the growth of agricultural activities”.Mentioning the peace initiatives taken in Tripura – three agreements signed in the last 10 years – the home minister recalled how the lives of Bru-Reang tribes have changed for the better with sops like permanent residency, education, healthcare, and job opportunitiesHe added that all the insurgent groups in Tripura have been eliminated, surrendered or become part of the mainstream. Shah said that Tripura is moving ahead on the path of participation instead of distraction, speed instead of obstruction, and welfare instead of delay.Underlining how development has picked up in the last seven years, Shah said the policies of Modi government have transformed Tripura from a landlocked state to a land-linked state. He said that airport, roads, water harvesting and irrigation have been taken up by the Government of India and Tripura for the all-round development of the state.","Home minister Amit Shah lauded the appointment of over 2800 youths in Tripura government.

We had issued a detailed statement on this issue on Aug 24, 2024,” Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh said on X.Referring to the glacial lake outburst-linked flash floods that destroyed the Teesta-III project in Oct 2023, Congress had last year alleged that hydel projects in ecologically fragile regions had been coming up over the past few years “without giving adequate thought to their cumulative environmental impacts”.“Dams on the Teesta are the prime, but not the only, example of how - in the name of development - ecology is being fundamentally altered, with grave consequences for this and future generations,” it said. The party had also flagged that a spate of hydro projects on the Teesta had caused the river to become more flood-prone, washing away sections of National Highway-10, the lifeline of Kalimpong in West Bengal and Sikkim.BJP Sikkim president D R Thapa on Feb 2 wrote to Modi, urging him to direct immediate withholding of the green panel’snod for the Teesta-III project until all necessary scientific reviews, including the revised Probable Maximum Flood study, are completed and independently validated.Thapa also urged the PM to order a fresh and comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) to incorporate recent climate data, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risks, and the state’s evolving ecological challenges before final decision.The expert panel had on Jan 10 given its conditional nod to certain amendments in the green clearance to resume construction of the 1,200 MW Teesta-III project. Redesigning the dam and replacing the earlier ‘concrete faced rockfill dam’ with a ‘concrete gravity dam’ is one of the amendments.The panel, however, put a condition, saying “all necessary permissions from Central Electricity Authority (CEA)/Central Water Commission (CWC) or any other agency with respect to project design and other safety parameters shall be obtained before starting the project construction work”.","Congress too opposed the approval, claiming the move was a “thoughtless clearance’ The threat of disaster continued to persist at the dam site, Congress said.

Amit Shah's strategy for zero infiltration and terrorism elimination in Jammu and Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shahs-strategy-for-zero-infiltration-and-terrorism-elimination-in-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/117955618.cms,"NEW DELHI: Directing the security forces and agencies to counter infiltration and acts of terror in Jammu and Kashmir with a ruthless approach, home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asked them to set their sights on achieving two key goals -- ‘zero infiltration’ and ‘uprooting the existence of terrorists’ in the Union territory.Chairing a high-level review meeting on the security scenario in J&K here, Shah flagged the role of narcotics proceeds in funding terror and facilitating infiltrators and stressed on the need to take prompt action against this trend with “alacrity and rigour”.The meeting on Wednesday was attended by J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, chief secretary and DGP, apart from Intelligence Bureau director and senior officials of the ministry of home affairs and J&K govt. The review was in continuation of the meeting chaired by Shah on Tuesday, in which the Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi, was present, among others.The back-to-back meetings by Shah came close on the heels of a terror attack in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, which had killed ex-serviceman Manzoor Ahmad Wagay, apart from injuring his wife and another relative.Stating that the Narendra Modi government is committed to completely wiping out terrorism from J&K, Shah said the sustained and coordinated efforts in this direction over the past 10 years have significantly weakened the terrorism ecosystem. He exhorted the security agencies to stay focused on taking stringent action against infiltrators and terrorists, including those engaged in terror financing . “Our goal should be to uproot the existence of terrorists,” Shah told the meeting.The home minister directed the agencies to make new appointments in the posts of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in view of the timely implementation of the new criminal laws.Recalling the Modi government's ‘policy of zero tolerance against terrorism’ to achieve the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu and Kashmir, Shah directed all security agencies to remain vigilant and continue to work in synergy to eliminate terrorism from the UT.“The Union home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies for significant improvement in all parameters of the security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir,” said a release issued by the home ministry after Wednesday’s review.","Home minister Amit Shah flagged the role of narcotics proceeds in funding terror and facilitating infiltrators.

PATNA: Bihar deputy chief minister Vijay Sinha on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal , claiming that the AAP chief brought in an ""era of fraudism"" in Delhi.""If anyone has brought the era of fraudism, then his name is Arvind Kejriwal. He does not believe in the constitution nor does he believe in constitutional institutions,"" Bihar deputy CM said.Adding that Kejriwal flip-flops between ""arrogance"" and ""discrediting constitutional institutions."" Deputy CM Sinha said, ""When this person (Arvind Kejriwal) wins the election. So he will sing his celebratory song in his arrogance. When he loses, he will stigmatize and discredit the constitutional institution and such people are not friendly to the nation. Punjab is an example of this.""His remarks come amidst Kejriwal's alleging on February 4 that the election commission and the Delhi Police are supporting hooliganism against AAP and protecting the BJP 's wrongdoing.Kejriwal took to social media to express his outrage, stating that the ECI and Delhi Police are working together to disrupt the electoral process and favour the BJP and claimed that their primary focus is to engage in hooliganism, protect the interests of BJP and distribute liquor and money.Meanwhile, voting in the Delhi Assembly elections concluded on Wednesday at 6 pm in all 11 districts of the national capital territory.The Bihar deputy CM also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , while Gandhi is on a visit to Patna.Deputy CM Sinha claimed that just like Congress is being ""wiped out"" from the country, they will be defeated in the upcoming Bihar Assembly election too.""Today was Rahul Gandhi's visit. They (Congress) are being wiped from all over the country. In Bihar too, they are afraid...they discredited the word Bihari and abused the word Bihari with the same group of people. They cannot provoke the people of Bihar,"" Sinha said.During his visit to Patna, Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of tokenism in Dalit representation .He claimed that while Dalits are being given representation, they are being denied any real power in decision-making processes.""In India's power structure today, whether it is education, health, corporate, business, judiciary, how much is your participation?... Dalits have been given representation but it means nothing if there is no participation in the power structure. Making you sit on the stage has no meaning if the decisions are made from behind the stage. Today, it has become a fashion to give tickets to people from different castes, PM Modi also did this,"" Rahul Gandhi said during his programme in Patna, on the occasion of Jaglal Choudhary Jayanti.But then, you (PM Modi) snatched the powers of the MLAs. Even the Lok Sabha MPs have no power to make any decisions. You made ministers but the officer on special duty (OSD) is from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The question is about control and participation...,"" the Congress leader added.","Bihar deputy chief minister Vijay Sinha launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal.

"Pledges of financial aid 'mere poll promises'; Delhi women say voted for education, safety",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pledges-of-financial-aid-mere-poll-promises-delhi-women-say-voted-for-education-safety/articleshow/117953397.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Labelling the announcements for financial assistance by political parties as ""mere poll promises"", a section of women in Delhi said they voted for better education and safety. A woman voter in Dilshad Garden said announcing a financial aid was just a poll promise.""We don't need this ... We want those that would improve a common person's life. I have been working as a government schoolteacher on a contract for eight years. I want the government to make my job permanent,"" she said.The BJP, AAP and the Congress have each promised financial assistance for women, a demographic that constitutes 46.2 per cent of Delhi's electorate. The national capital has 72.36 lakh women voters.The saffron party has proposed a monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 for all women while the ruling AAP, under the Mahila Samman Yojana, has pledged Rs 2,100 per month. The Congress has promised Rs 2,500 per month to every woman under the Pyari Didi Yojana, similar to initiatives implemented in other states governed by it.Gole Market resident Madhu said, ""Everyone is trying to buy votes. After one party announced a monthly allowance for women, all other parties did the same. Why didn't they do it earlier?""""I voted for development and better opportunities for the future generation, not fake allowances,"" she added.Priya Sharma, a 35-year-old voter in Southeast Delhi, said that, as a woman, she was looking for a government that truly understood and addressed her needs.Okhla resident Ayesha Khan (27) called the election a chance to choose a government that would support women's rights, education, health care, and safety.""We are seeking a government that will prioritise our safety, health and empowerment. This election is our chance to have a say in shaping a better future for women,"" she said.Emphasising that the parties knew women's voices mattered, she said she expected a government that didn't just use women for elections with promises of monthly allowances or free bus rides.Women voters in Delhi's northeast and east said the pre-election promises of monthly allowances were not a matter of concern for them.Shazia, a homemaker in Babarpur, said employment was a major issue.""The election is one of hope. Apart from getting free electricity and water supply, we also want jobs for everyone. Everything is becoming expensive. We hope the party that forms the government will look into this issue,"" she said.Mustafabad resident Gulshan said she wanted the government to fulfil women's basic needs as well as ensuring their security.Rabia Khan, a homemaker in Jafrabad, said she wanted the incoming government to focus on addressing inflation.""We want a government which focuses on inflation and provides us with a better and affordable environment for living. The promise of financial assistance is not in our minds,"" she said.On the other end of the spectrum, 37-year-old house help Meena Kumari ,who lives in Amrit Puri Garhi, said the government allowance would help her immensely.""I work as a maid and get between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 for cleaning one house. If the government provides an allowance, it will help me financially,"" she said.""I consider it a good move. Many other states are already doing this and, hopefully, the Delhi government will stand by its promise,"" she added.Polling to decide the fate of 699 candidates across the national capital's 70 assembly constituencies were held on Wednesday.While AAP is eyeing a third consecutive term, the BJP is looking to return to office for the first time since 1998. The Congress, which drew a blank in the last two elections, is eyeing a comeback.The votes will be counted on Saturday.","The BJP, AAP and the Congress have each promised financial assistance for women.

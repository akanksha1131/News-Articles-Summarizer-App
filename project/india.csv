NEW DELHI: It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives. On Thursday, officials said that debris, including the aircraft’s damaged tail fin, still remains at the crash site as investigators continue to search for clues to determine the exact cause of the accident.The debris, including the tail fin, is still lying at the site. There are no orders yet to move the rubble elsewhere,” Ahmedabad's additional chief fire officer, Jayesh Khadia said.Inspector DB Basiya of Meghaninagar police station confirmed that the AAIB will decide the fate of the plane wreckage.“The police’s role is limited to securing the area. AAIB will determine what to do with the remains, which may later be moved to another location for further examination,” he said.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is leading an investigation to understand the cause of one of the worst air disasters in recent times. AAIB officials have been making regular visits to the crash site as part of the ongoing probe.Local fire personnel are assisting forensic and aviation experts with site operations.On June 12, the London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 people, crashed into a hostel building of BJ Medical College in Meghaninagar just minutes after taking off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1.39 pm.After the crash, the aircraft’s tail fin got stuck at the top of the damaged building and was brought down using cranes on June 14, two days after the incident.Days after the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, investigators also located the Cockpit Voice Recorder on June 16. Officials said this crucial discovery could help in understanding the cause of the crash.Officials confirmed the recovery of black boxes to PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who inspected the site on Sunday.While the AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols, as the crashed aircraft was American-made, according to an official release.","It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives.

Operation Sindoor: Deputy PM admits Pakistan asked for ceasefire after India struck 2 airbases - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-deputy-pm-admits-pak-asked-for-ceasefire-after-india-struck-2-airbases-watch/articleshow/121957791.cms,"Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar

'Insult To India': Political Uproar Over Trump's Credit to PM Modi, Pak Army Chief For Ceasefire

Nur Khan airbase

Rafiqui airbase

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

Israel-Iran war: Trump weighs US strike; Netanyahu cites 'personal cost',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-war-trump-weighs-us-strike-netanyahu-cites-personal-cost-10-key-points/articleshow/121964961.cms,"Here are 10 key developments:

Trump: Decision on US strike in 'next two weeks'

IRGC intel chief among those targeted by Israel

Cluster bomb used in strike on Israeli hospital

' Khamenei should not continue to exist,' Says Israel Katz



US military aircraft no longer visible in Qatar: Satellite images

Netanyahu reveals 'personal cost' of war with Iran

Geneva diplomatic talks offer glimmer of hope

Internet blackout in Iran obscures situation

US-Israel alignment under scrutiny

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.In the midst of this turmoil, President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.Although Trump and Netanyahu share strategic goals, including deterring Iran’s nuclear development, they appear to diverge tactically. Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Ayatollah Khamenei and has been cautious about direct involvement. However, Netanyahu has said he trusts Trump “to do what’s best for America” and credited Washington for already offering substantial support. The current phase of the conflict may test U.S. -Israeli coordination like never before, especially if diplomacy fails.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

Woman deboarded after alert from flight captain





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, 36, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.

Yashwant Varma : Probe panel junks both theories offered by Varma in his defence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-panel-junks-both-theories-offered-by-varma-in-his-defence/articleshow/121961327.cms,"Yashwant Varma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges. It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy.

Mattias Ekholm ’s wife praises Oilers Nation with raw, emotional letter after crushing Stanley Cup loss



The Edmonton Oilers' dream of clinching the Stanley Cup came to a devastating end yet again, this time in Game 6 against the Florida Panthers. With a 5-1 loss sealing a 4-2 series defeat, the heartbreak ran deep — not just among players and fans, but also within the families who’ve stood by through every exhausting moment.Amid the emotional wreckage, one voice quietly stood out — not from the locker room, but from the sidelines. Ida Björnstad, wife of Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm and a respected Swedish sports journalist, took to Instagram to deliver a deeply moving message that resonated far beyond the final score.“As you might know, I’m a writer, and I love to put my thoughts into sentences and stories,” Ida began, in a post that felt more like a journal entry than a public statement. “Most of my texts stay with me. This time, though, I would like to share some words with you.”Her post was more than a show of support; it was a heartfelt window into the emotional toll a Stanley Cup run takes on not only players but also their families. Ida’s perspective came not as a reporter, but as a partner who’s been living the ups and downs of the season behind closed doors.“I know how much hockey means to the Canadian people, and I understand that the people in Edmonton are heartbroken today, including our family,” she wrote, capturing the collective disappointment that enveloped the city after the Oilers fell short again.She went on to highlight the intense mental and physical demands that playoff hockey imposes: “Throughout the playoffs, many things are happening behind the scenes. Boundaries are being pushed in the most demanding way, both physically and mentally. For the players and their families, everything is about maximizing the chances of winning.”Despite flashes of brilliance from Edmonton — including two hard-fought overtime wins — the Panthers controlled much of the series. Edmonton was behind for a record-setting 255 minutes and 49 seconds and was outscored 28-17 overall. Game 6 saw Florida dominate early, with the Oilers unable to find their rhythm again.Still, Ida chose to focus on the positives. “For two years in a row, we have made it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers are the second-best hockey team in the world, and we have fans who support this team in both good times and bad. There is so much to be proud of and thankful for.”And in her final thought, she reminded everyone of the bigger picture: “As much as it hurts when you lose, this is a journey we will look back on one day, reflecting on the highs and lows and understanding that everything made sense.”As the Oilers now prepare for a pivotal offseason, Ida’s message offers something rare — a sense of grace and perspective in the face of loss, reminding fans why they fell in love with this team in the first place.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky loved Panthers' Cup win over Oilers but also admits one part didn’t sit right","Edmonton Oilers' dream of clinching the Stanley Cup came to a devastating end yet again.

Panthers' Stanley Cup celebration hits a sour note as Wayne Gretzky reveals one major complaint



The Florida Panthers sealed their second consecutive Stanley Cup in spectacular fashion, and Sam Reinhart’s unforgettable performance in Game 6 became the night’s defining moment. With four goals to his name, Reinhart powered the Panthers to a 5-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers and etched his name alongside hockey royalty.Reinhart's scoring spree not only clinched the Cup but also tied Wayne Gretzky’s iconic 1985 record of seven goals in a single Final series. But in typical Gretzky fashion, the hockey legend met the moment with charm and humor rather than disappointment.“My records this year are dropping like flies, Eddie O,” Gretzky quipped during the postgame broadcast to analyst Eddie Olczyk. His remark, filled with playful sarcasm, was met with a laugh as Olczyk assured him, “You still got another 40 or 50, Gretz. You’re OK.”While Gretzky’s record may have taken a hit, his admiration for Reinhart was clear. The Panthers’ forward accomplished this milestone while pushing through a Grade 2 MCL tear, an injury he sustained in the Eastern Conference Final. “I can’t really put into words what it means,” Reinhart reflected.“It’s something you never really think about... this one was even harder to overcome and be here at the end.”Two of Reinhart’s goals came on empty nets, but the impact of his performance was undeniable. It was a statement game, one that cemented Florida's dominance and placed Reinhart among the elite.The victory made Florida the first team since the Tampa Bay Lightning’s 2020–21 run to repeat as champions. But it was Reinhart’s tenacity and historical achievement that stood out.As confetti fell and Florida celebrated on home ice, hockey fans witnessed a rare bridging of eras—where a modern-day warrior matched the mark of a hockey legend, and that legend, with a wink, tipped his cap. The 2025 Stanley Cup Final didn’t just end with a trophy; it added a new chapter to the sport’s most storied history.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky’s workout fit has fans raising eyebrows","Florida Panthers beat Edmonton Oilers 5-1 to win the Stanley Cup.

Paulina Gretzky’s viral post for Wayne Gretzky fuels talk as Dustin Johnson battles golf struggles

Paulina Gretzky celebrates Wayne Gretzky with moving message

Golf fans are talking again. Dustin Johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch. Missing important cuts has raised red flags. Meanwhile, his wife, Paulina Gretzky , honoured her father, hockey great Wayne Gretzky, in a heartfelt social post. This family moment shines, even as Dustin battles form and tough odds.Dustin Johnson, aged 40, was once a top golf star with major wins like the U.S. Open in 2016 and the Masters in 2020. But lately, he has not had the same edge on the LIV Golf tour. In the 2025 season, he missed the cut at both the Masters and PGA Championship. Reports say he shot 10-over in just 36 holes at Oakmont, a venue where he had previous success.These results have fans and analysts worried. Golf is a sport of form and confidence, two things that now seem in short supply for Dustin. His swing speed has dropped, and errors are up. Sources within LIV Golf suggest that he may change his training or work with a new coach. But no official plan has been shared yet.Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson's wife and daughter of legendary hockey player Wayne Gretzky, uploaded an Instagram homage to her father on Father's Day, June 16, 2025.She showed a picture of the two of them and said how much she appreciates his guidance and support throughout the years.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s Daughter Paulina Gretzky Filmed In Awkward Moment At 2016 U.S. Open By Oakmont Cameraman Fans lauded the letter as ""genuine love"" and ""honest respect.” Paulina also disclosed a family narrative: Wayne first met Dustin at a pro‑am event in 2009. Wayne was the one who nudged Paulina to know Dustin. That recommendation led them to wed in 2022 and get married in 2013.Adding to their close family relationship, the pair has two boys. Wayne provided unity and support through his presence at events both on and off the golf course.Now as Dustin works to rebuild his game, many believe having Paulina and Wayne by his side could help him find his way again. With his game faltering, Dustin Johnson faces a crucial crossroads. Yet, with Paulina Gretzky and Wayne Gretzky’s steadfast support, fans remain hopeful he can reclaim his winning form and confidence.","Dustin Johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch.

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL GOAT took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching.

Stephen A. Smith’s daughter Samantha Smith ’s confident cameo stuns ESPN crew



In a surprising twist during ESPN’s pregame coverage of Game 6 of the NBA Finals, it wasn’t Stephen A. Smith’s booming voice or passionate takes that stole the show like his usual style. This time, it was his 17-year-old daughter, Samantha who appeared on camera with her father. While the veteran broadcaster was on air from Gainbridge Fieldhouse, ready to dissect the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers showdown, viewers instead got a rare, lighthearted peek into Smith’s personal life as his daughter made an impromptu on-camera appearance that quickly became the highlight of the night.As Stephen A. Smith and Elle Duncan were warming up the broadcast on the court, Duncan playfully invited Samantha over, joking that it was “Bring your daughter to work day.” Smith, visibly uncomfortable but trying to roll with it, instructed her, “Say hi.” Samantha seized the moment without hesitation: “Hi guys, I’m Samantha.” When her dad pulled the mic away, she clapped back effortlessly, “I’m talking here.”It didn’t stop there.“I’m Stephen’s daughter. I’m so happy to be here, I’ve made so many friends. This is really…” she began, only for her father to interject, “You just got here five minutes ago.” Samantha didn’t blink. “This is a really great experience. This is a really great experience and I feel really grateful to be here, you guys,” she continued confidently, leaving the panel and viewers, and of course, his ESPN colleague in awe.Later, NBA Countdown host Malika Andrews brought Samantha back on-air for her game pick. Going against her father, she declared, “I’m going OKC. I think they’re just going to end it tonight. I think Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] has been killing it all season and he won MVP for a reason. So I think we’re just going to finish it out now.”Smith, after having the candid father-daughter moment, looked both amused and defeated as his colleagues teased, “We much prefer her pick over yours.” He questioned, “You’re going against your daddy on live television?” to which Samantha shrugged and replied, “I think he knows I’m right.” Eventually, he admitted, “She usually beats me on predictions.”Also Read: ""He's miserable"": Fans slam Stephen A.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver













The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option.

“Stepping into psychological warfare”: NFL legend warns Bill Belichick as he is risking UNC career for ‘inappropriate’ relationship with Jordon Hudson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stepping-into-psychological-warfare-nfl-legend-warns-bill-belichick-as-he-is-risking-unc-career-for-inappropriate-relationship-with-jordon-hudson/articleshow/121922951.cms,"Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is sparking concerns about his potential involvement UNC (Getty Images)

Bill Belichick’s romance could trigger ‘psychological warfare’ at UNC

Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program, specifically . Former NFL player Shawne Merriman warned this situation could lead to ""psychological warfare,"" potentially jeopardizing Belichick's reputation and a team's focus due to off-field distractions.The whispers surrounding celebrated NFL coach Bill Belichick and his purported connection with former cheerleader Jordon Hudson are now casting a shadow over his prospective engagement with a university athletic program, particularly at the University of North Carolina.The spotlight intensified considerably after Shawne Merriman, a former NFL linebacker and an ACC icon, issued a stark caution: if Belichick isn't careful, this personal situation could very well devolve into ""psychological warfare.""Merriman's commentary on the Belichick-Hudson situation was unambiguous during a recent podcast appearance. The former San Diego Chargers standout articulated clearly what he believes is at stake: ""He's stepping into psychological warfare now, man. That's going to cost him dearly. That's not a win.""Shawne Merriman’s warning exceeds mere media sensationalism. With Belichick being considered for future advisory or mentorship roles at the collegiate level, especially at UNC where his ties run deep, such personal narratives could become significant impediments, affecting recruitment, team concentration, and his standing with younger athletes and staff.At 72, Belichick holds an esteemed position in NFL history, celebrated for his precise approach and unwavering commitment to football fundamentals. However, his name has recently graced headlines of a vastly different nature. His alleged romantic involvement with Jordon Hudson—a woman nearly five decades his junior—has ignited a flurry of tabloid speculation and widespread social media discourse.For a coach aspiring to transition into a new capacity within college football, potentially as a consultant or executive, such personal entanglements risk overshadowing his distinguished professional legacy. Universities, especially high-profile programs like UNC, generally prefer to maintain pristine reputations when enlisting prominent figures to guide young athletes or contribute to team development.Whether Belichick ultimately aligns with UNC or another collegiate program remains uncertain. Yet, as Merriman’s comments imply, the mere presence of personal controversy, even if unconfirmed, can be potent enough to create significant hurdles in the fiercely competitive realm of college athletics.Bill Belichick may have stepped away from the NFL sidelines for the moment, but if his ambition is to forge a new path at the collegiate level, adeptly navigating public perception will prove just as crucial as his mastery of Xs and Os.Also Read: “Biggest killer”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen faced backlash after risking their baby’s life in reckless ATV joyride with no helmet Only time will tell if Belichick can successfully navigate these personal waters while building a new chapter in his legendary coaching career at the collegiate level.","Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program.

'Not asking for US green light': Netanyahu says Israel will hit all nuclear sites in Iran; quiet on eliminating Khamenei,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/not-asking-for-us-green-light-netanyahu-says-israel-will-hit-all-nuclear-sites-in-iran-eliminating-khamenei/articleshow/121964429.cms,"



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will not wait for a US green light to continue its military campaign against Iran and is fully committed to hitting all Iranian nuclear sites — including the heavily fortified Fordo facility.""We will achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear facilities. We have the capability to do that,"" Netanyahu declared in a rare Hebrew-language interview with the Kan public broadcaster, underscoring Israel’s determination to act decisively and independently.The comment came hours after US President Donald Trump said he will decide whether to join Israel's strikes on Iran within the next two weeks as there is still a ""substantial"" chance of talks to end the conflict. ""Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,"" Trump had said in a statement.Netanyahu emphasised that Israel is proceeding with its campaign regardless of whether the United States decides to join the offensive. “Whether US President Donald Trump wants to join or not — that’s entirely his decision,” he said.“He’ll do what’s good for the United States, and I’ll do what’s good for the State of Israel.” The prime minister stressed that Israel is not asking for permission or a “green light” from any foreign power.“Either way, we’re going to do this, because we have no choice. We will not allow 3,500 years of Jewish history to come to an end because of this deranged ayatollah,” Netanyahu declared, referencing Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Netanyahu outlined Israel’s comprehensive strategy to neutralise Iran’s nuclear threat by targeting every nuclear facility, including the underground Fordo site, which is widely considered one of the most secure and difficult to strike.“We have the capability to do that,” he said confidently, signaling Israel’s readiness to deploy advanced military assets to destroy even the most heavily fortified targets.The prime minister reported that Israel is “ahead of schedule” in its campaign, having already destroyed at least half of Iran’s missile launchers and eliminated key military leaders. He highlighted ongoing strikes against paramilitary forces such as the Basij militia, which plays a critical role in suppressing dissent within Iran. Netanyahu also noted that Israel has inflicted “heavy damage” on the regime’s internal security apparatus and will continue to target symbols of the Iranian government.While Israel is prepared to act independently, Netanyahu acknowledged the importance of US support.He revealed that he speaks with President Trump almost daily and described their conversations as “very good.”However, he declined to disclose details, saying, “Let’s not call on the historical archive to release itself just yet.”Netanyahu praised Trump’s recognition of Israel’s right to self-defense, contrasting it with former President Joe Biden’s attempts to restrict Israeli operations against Iranian proxies.On the question of regime change, Netanyahu reiterated that it is ultimately up to the Iranian people.“The issue of regime change or the downfall of this administration primarily concerns the Iranian populace,” he said.Nonetheless, he emphasized that Israel is striking government targets and symbols of the regime and that “there’s more to come.” Netanyahu described Iran’s Supreme Leader as a “deranged ayatollah” threatening the future of the Jewish people and stressed that Israel will do “everything necessary” to neutralize the existential threat posed by Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Asked whether Khamenei is a dead man walking, he replied: ""I gave instructions that no one is immune. I prefer not to deal with [making] headlines and to let actions speak for themselves.""“During a war words have to be chosen with care, and actions with precision,"" he said adding that he expects this “from my ministers as well"", an implied criticism of defense minister Israel Katz, who has been publicly threatening Khamenei.",Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not wait for a US green light to continue its military campaign against Iran.

Israel reportedly floated such plans to the Obama administration years ago. Air supremacy tactics: With Israel having temporarily gained air dominance over large swathes of Iran, it could loiter over Fordow and disrupt activities, although this wouldn't eliminate the facility.

Would the US step in?



Why the stakes are so high







As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, a chilling question arises: Could this spiral into a nuclear crisis? In the past five days, the situation has worsened, with Israel reportedly targeting nuclear sites in Tehran. Experts warn that any further escalation could be catastrophic. At the heart of these rising tensions lies Iran’s most secretive and fortified nuclear facility, Fordow.Tucked deep beneath a mountain near Qom, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is one of Iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites. Its underground design—80 to 90 meters below the surface—makes it virtually impenetrable to aerial strikes, even with the most advanced bunker-buster bombs in Israel’s arsenal. Originally exposed in 2009 through Western intelligence, Fordow was built in secrecy and designed for survivability, especially in the face of potential military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.What makes Fordow particularly alarming to global powers is its capacity to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade. According to the IAEA, the site now houses 2,700 centrifuges and has been enriching uranium to 60%—a short technical step away from the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), uranium enriched to 83.7% purity was found at the site in 2023, dangerously close to the 90% enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.Experts warn that Iran could produce enough material for multiple bombs in just weeks if it chooses to weaponize its stockpile. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility, raising the stakes of any military or diplomatic attempt to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster—that might reach its buried core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes. For Iran, Fordow is a nuclear insurance policy. For the world, it is a red line—and possibly a countdown.""The Iranians fully understood that the Israelis would try to get inside their programs, and they built Fordo inside of a mountain a long time ago to take care of the post-Iraq problem,"" said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.Only one known weapon could potentially take out Fordow: the US-made 30,000-pound bomb. This bomb, also called ""bunker buster,"" is capable of burrowing through rock and steel before detonating.But there's a catch: Israel doesn't have it. The United States has consistently denied Israeli requests for the bomb, citing fears that its use could provoke a full-scale regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said general Joseph Votel, former head of US central command.While Israel lacks the bunker buster or a heavy bomber to deliver it, it hasn't given up on options:""The Israelis have sprung a lot of clandestine operations lately,"" said general Kenneth McKenzie Jr, former commander of US central command. ""But the physics of the problem remain the same.""While the US has moved aircraft and refuelling tankers into the region, there's no indication yet that US President Donald Trump is prepared to shift long-standing US policy and provide Israel with the bomb. Officials warn that deploying it would involve complex coordination and risk significant collateral and geopolitical fallout.""If we use the bunker buster, there could be nuclear contamination,"" general Votel said. ""I think there would also certainly be fallout internationally over the idea that the United States joined Israel in what would be viewed as an illegal attack on the sovereignty of Iran,"" he added.Fordow is not just a physical challenge—it is a political one. An Israeli strike on the site, especially with US involvement, could trigger Iranian retaliation against American assets across the Middle East and plunge the region into another war.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But with enrichment levels rising and regional threats mounting, international anxiety over Fordow continues to grow.Fordow symbolises the nuclear stalemate between Iran and its adversaries. For Israel, it represents the limits of its conventional reach. For the US, it is a geopolitical tripwire. And for Iran, it remains a testament to strategic foresight in the face of existential threats. As the Middle East teeters on the edge of a broader conflict, what happens—or does n't—at Fordow could shape the course of history.","Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster that might reach the core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121909319,imgsize-1036760,width-400,resizemode-4/121909319.jpg"

Huge FIREBALL As Iranian Missile Dodges Iron Dome, Explodes In Between Tel Aviv Skyscrapers

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile, marking one of the most direct attacks on Israel's economic infrastructure since hostilities erupted.The strike was part of a wider Iranian missile barrage that targeted multiple locations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva, as per Al Jazeera and local media reports.The attack marks a significant escalation on the seventh day of direct conflict between the two long-time rivals.“This morning, Iran's terrorist dictators fired missiles at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and at civilians in the centre of the country,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X. “We will make the tyrants in Tehran pay a heavy price,” he added, condemning the strikes on civilian infrastructure, including the hospital and the stock exchange.According to Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service, at least 47 people were injured during the attacks, with 18 more hurt while rushing to bomb shelters.Soroka Hospital in Be’er Sheva suffered a direct hit. The hospital director confirmed “several wards were completely demolished and there is extensive damage across the medical centre,” reported AFP.Iran, on its part, said its missiles were aimed at Israeli military and intelligence installations. Iranian state media reported the operation was part of “True Promise 3,” launched in retaliation for Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion”—a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets that began on June 13. On Thursday, Israel responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated and that “there is no radiation danger whatsoever. ”The strikes on Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva came as tensions reached a boiling point following Israel’s repeated attacks on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, including recent airstrikes on over 20 military and nuclear sites across Tehran, Natanz, and Arak.According to CNN, the Israeli Air Force deployed 60 fighter jets to strike centrifuge production and R&D sites linked to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.The missile that hit the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange comes as both countries continue to exchange daily barrages. An Israeli military official, quoted by AFP, said that since the conflict began, Iran has launched around 400 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones. Of these, around 20 missiles have landed in civilian areas of Israel, the official said.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has hinted at possible intervention but stopped short of confirming any military action. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he told reporters. “I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due, because things change. Especially with war.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has dismissed US demands, saying: “This nation will never surrender,” and warned of “irreparable damage” if the US intervenes.Both nations continue to count mounting casualties. As of the last official update, at least 24 Israelis had been killed and hundreds wounded, according to Netanyahu’s office. Iran said over 220 people, including military commanders and civilians, had died from Israeli strikes, though neither side has released updated figures since.","The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile.

Iran's Nuclear Ambitions





While President Donald J. Trump was issuing fresh warnings from the White House — “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple.” — a more peculiar nuclear mystery was unfolding online. This one wasn’t about centrifuges spinning in Fordo or uranium stockpiles in Natanz. It was about Jeff.Specifically, a bar chart from CNN titled “World’s Nuclear Arsenals” listed the usual powers: Russia, the United States, France, China, the UK, and so on. But tucked away near the bottom, with fewer than 10 warheads, was an unexpected entrant: Jeff. No flag. No footnote. Just the name — as if he were a rogue microstate with a doomsday arsenal.So who is Jeff? To the casual viewer, Jeff might sound like a rogue nuclear actor. A breakaway republic? A tech billionaire with a uranium hobby? A bulky think tank guy?The answer is disappointingly rational. JEFF stands for the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion File, a nuclear data library maintained by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). It is not a country and does not possess weapons. It compiles nuclear reaction data for civilian applications — including power generation, reactor safety, and medical isotopes.The latest dataset, JEFF-3.3, released in 2017, is widely used across Europe.What likely happened is a labelling error: a dataset meant to be cited as the source of nuclear information was mistakenly interpreted as an entity with nuclear weapons. This misrepresentation, noted in a 2024 IFLScience article, shows how easily public understanding of complex topics can be distorted — especially when visualised without context.While social media turned Jeff into a fictional arms dealer, the real nuclear issue — Iran — continues to escalate. Trump’s administration, now back in office, has repeatedly stated that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is non-negotiable.Iran’s nuclear programme began under the Shah in the 1950s, with US support through President Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor was built with American assistance. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the programme was briefly suspended but revived in the 1980s with help from Pakistan, Russia, and China — this time without Western oversight.By the early 2000s, Iran’s nuclear activities drew intense scrutiny. In 2002, dissident groups revealed secret enrichment facilities at Natanz and Arak, prompting IAEA investigations. Iran maintained that its goals were peaceful — energy independence and medical research — but limited inspector access and evidence of weaponisation work raised alarms.This led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to restrict uranium enrichment and submit to international inspections in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, Trump withdrew from the deal, citing weak enforcement and sunset clauses.Since then, Iran has significantly expanded its enrichment activities. As of 2025, it is enriching uranium to 60% purity — just shy of weapons-grade — and is believed to have enough material for a bomb within weeks, if it chooses to proceed, according to IAEA assessments.Trump has responded with blunt consistency: “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Not as a slogan, but as a foreign policy red line.","A bar chart from CNN titled ‘World’s Nuclear Arsenals’ listed the usual powers: Russia, the United States, France, China, the UK, and so on. tucked away near the bottom, with fewer than 10 warheads, was an unexpected entrant: Jeff.

Ime Udoka’s rise in Houston Rockets just triggered one of the boldest moves this offseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/ime-udokas-rise-in-houston-rockets-just-triggered-one-of-the-boldest-moves-this-offseason/articleshow/121960473.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

The linchpin behind Houston’s transformation in just two seasons

Ime Udoka has turned the Houston Rockets from an afterthought into a serious contender. After a dismal 22-win season, he pushed them to a 52–30 record and a No. 2 seed in the West. His gritty, defense-first mindset reshaped everything. Now, with an eight-figure extension and full backing from the front office, Udoka stands as the face of a rising powerhouse built for the long haul.When Ime Udoka came on board in April 2023, the Rockets were still recovering their head after a historic worst streak in the franchise history, where the last season recorded only 22 victories out of 82 matches. And under his leadership they were able to reverse it and complete 41-41 in the first year of his directing of the team, and then they really began to soar in 2024-25 achieving 52-30 and earning the number two slot. Udoka’s philosophy, rooted in his experience with Gregg Popovich, emphasized a defense-first approach. The result was a squad that ranked fifth in defensive efficiency and was recognized as one of the toughest teams to face in the league.Even though the financial specifics are kept secret, ESPN’s Shams Charania has confirmed that Udoka’s new deal is long-term, placing him among the NBA’s highest earners with a salary in the eight figures per season.The Houston front office didn’t waste any time, reportedly stopping the Knicks from interviewing Udoka during their coaching transition. This level of confidence shows just how important he is to the Rockets’ resurgence.Udoka’s extension isn’t just a single headline—it’s a crucial element of a wider rebuild. The Rockets have also secured veteran center Steven Adams with a three-year, $39 million deal, are looking to sort out Fred VanVleet’s $44.9 million team option, and continue to be involved in trade talks regarding Kevin Durant. Under Udoka’s guidance, young stars like Alperen Şengün (an All-Star) and Amen Thompson (All-Defense) have blossomed, strengthening Houston’s future core.Also Read: LeBron James Pushes Back on NBA’s 'Ring Culture,' Says Team Titles Shouldn’t Define Individual Greatness Udoka’s extension isn’t merely a headline—it’s a key part of a larger rebuild.

Strong backstage support for LA Knight’s brand switch



His feuds are already on both shows



Seth Rollins and company lay waste to LA Knight: SmackDown highlights, June 6, 2025

LA Knight could be getting a big change in his WWE career. Reports say that WWE is thinking about moving him from SmackDown to RAW. Many people backstage believe he could do well on RAW, especially now that WWE shows are streaming on Netflix. This move could help him become an even bigger star.Knight is one of the most popular superstars in WWE right now. He has become a fan favorite without needing a title to prove it. On SmackDown, he has been in big storylines and even competed in three Money in the Bank matches. But now, there is news that his time on the blue brand might be ending.According to WrestleVotes, several people inside WWE are pushing for LA Knight to move to RAW. They believe he would bring something new and exciting to Monday nights. RAW is known for its long storylines and character development, which could be great for someone like Knight.“According to those within the company, more than a handful of people are advocating for LA Knight to be moved to the #WWERAW brand in the near future as his presence on Netflix could be viewed as something of a refreshing change.”Knight has not wrestled much on RAW in the past.He has only had two matches on the show, one in March 2023 against Cody Rhodes and one in February 2024 against Ivar. But recently, he has been making surprise appearances on RAW, and that has led many to believe that a full-time move could be near.“LA Knight has been signed with the company since February of 2021 and has two Raw matches under his belt. He’s been appearing on Raw over the last two weeks, very, very briefly. However, there are more than a handful of people like we just said that want to see him on Monday Night Raw each and every week.”Knight’s recent storylines have involved superstars from both RAW and SmackDown. After Seth Rollins beat him in the Money in the Bank match, Rollins attacked Knight on SmackDown.Then, Knight got his revenge on RAW by costing Bron Breakker a match. Later, Knight was attacked again during his own match. This back-and-forth has made fans excited and shows that he fits in well on both brands.Moving him to RAW would open up fresh rivalries and give him more screen time. It would also help RAW feel new and excited if someone as popular as LA Knight showed up every week.Also Read: SmackDown chaos: Aleister Black goes after Seth Rollins, Bron Breakker strikes","LA Knight could be getting a big change in his WWE career.

Is Offset playing games or just caught in a messy love web?

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs stay above the fray amid quiet soft-launch romance

The hip-hop and NFL worlds are colliding again—and not for a remix. This time, it’s Offset making headlines after being spotted at the same nightclub as Sky Marlene, the ex-girlfriend of NFL star Stefon Diggs. What adds fuel to the fire? Stefon Diggs just so happens to be Cardi B’s rumored new man, while she’s still legally married to Offset. Coincidence? Fans aren’t buying it.According to Rain Drops Media, Sky was seen at the club where Offset performed, and while the two didn’t exchange any overtly flirty glances—or numbers—just their simultaneous presence has the internet convinced that this was anything but accidental. Twitter, as usual, erupted.“Going after the ex of your ex-wife’s boyfriend as a way to get back at her is some pathetic bitter loser shit,” one user tweeted, capturing the sentiment shared by many. Another added, “This just lets you know these hoes be living aimless lives,” as the drama played out like a crossover episode of Love & Hip Hop and Hard Knocks.While there’s no official confirmation that Offset and Sky Marlene have any romantic connection, the fact that she appeared at a club where he was performing on the same night Cardi B’s relationship with Diggs dominates headlines? That’s either next-level pettiness or cosmic coincidence.Meanwhile, Cardi B and Stefon Diggs seem perfectly content playing it cool. They’ve been spotted together on yachts and in cozy settings, but neither has addressed the romance publicly. “When you’re busy building an empire and still collecting checks from your soon-to-be ex-husband’s royalties, you don’t have time for the ex of your man’s ex,” one fan wrote, summing up Cardi’s mood perfectly.Diggs, now with the New England Patriots, continues his silent vibe-only PR strategy—no comments, no confirmations, just touchdowns and tranquility.Also Read: “I still didn’t win”: Josh Allen calls MVP award worthless—says it means nothing without a ring Whether Offset and Sky Marlene’s club cameo was a carefully orchestrated revenge play or a harmless coincidence, one thing is clear: in celebrity circles, even a passing moment can spiral into headline-making chaos.","Offset was spotted at the same nightclub as Sky Marlene, the ex-girlfriend of NFL star Stefon Diggs.

The liver is the largest internal organ in your body. It plays a key role in digesting food, storing energy, and eliminating toxins.Liver health implies the overall well-being and proper functioning of the liver, a vital organ responsible for over 500 essential functions in the body. These functions include filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile for digestion, storing glucose, and metabolizing nutrients. Maintaining liver health is crucial for overall well-being, as a healthy liver ensures efficient detoxification, nutrient processing, and other vital processes.Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver. There are two primary types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease, also known as alcoholic steatohepatitis.Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population. Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).Often termed the ""silent epidemic,"" NAFLD can progress to more severe conditions like cirrhosis soon, if left unchecked. While many symptoms manifest during the day, certain warning signs become more pronounced at night.Recognizing these nocturnal symptoms is crucial for early detection and management.Individuals with fatty liver disease often report difficulty falling or staying asleep . The discomfort from liver inflammation or the body's struggle to process toxins can lead to restless nights. Moreover, the liver's reduced ability to store and release glycogen can cause blood sugar imbalances, further disrupting sleep patterns.A common symptom of fatty liver disease is discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This sensation can worsen at night, making it hard to get a good night's sleep. People may feel a sense of fullness or pressure, which can be quite concerning.Though not typically a symptom seen during night time, a decrease in appetite, particularly at night, may signify fatty liver disease. Individuals may find they have less interest in food, especially during dinner, which could eventually lead to weight loss and nutritional problems.As fatty liver disease progresses, the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream can affect brain function. This may lead to symptoms like confusion, poor memory, or trouble focusing on any task, commonly referred to as ""brain fog.""Fatigue is a hallmark of fatty liver disease. However, when the liver's detoxification processes are compromised, individuals may experience overwhelming tiredness during the night. This isn't just typical tiredness; it's an overpowering fatigue that can interfere with daily life.While swelling can occur at any time, it may become more noticeable at night. Fluid retention due to liver dysfunction can lead to swelling in the legs and feet, causing discomfort and affecting sleep quality.Fatty liver disease can cause itchy skin, especially if liver damage affects bile flow. When bile salts build up under the skin, it can cause irritation and itching, even if there is no visible rash.Unexplained weight loss can be an early indicator of fatty liver disease.

Poll Have you heard of meningococcal septicemia before reading this article? Yes, I was aware No, I had never heard of it

What exactly is it?



How does someone catch it?

NB: This information is based on internet research and is intended for general knowledge only. It should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection, and now doctors are warning others to be aware of the symptoms.William Hand, a recent 8th-grade graduate from Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, started feeling really unwell early on June 8. He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, ""Everything snowballed and God called him home."" He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with ""flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire,"" saying, ""I will see you again, son. ""Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat, and is usually fatal.Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference. It’s one of those “better safe than sorry” situations where awareness really can save lives. So donot dismiss the signs.","A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection.

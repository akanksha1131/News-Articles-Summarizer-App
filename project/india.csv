Jemimah, dropped from the match against England, returned to script history against Australia. Shafali, not even in the original squad, was called in at the last minute — and herin the final turned the impossible into triumph. Those once sidelined became the ones who conquered.That same undaunted spirit lives beyond the boundaries of sport.In my field, of public speaking, I once traced the story of the.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya Janata Party accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

'Stray dogs not to be released back to site from where they are picked up'





Also read:

NEW DELHI: Noting that India continues to report one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates and there has been an alarming increase in dog-bite incidents, making public places unsafe, Supreme Court Friday directed that stray dogs be removed from premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands and depots, and railway stations. The court made it clear the authority concerned will face consequences for non-compliance.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria said the ""menace of dog bites"", particularly in public and private institutions that serve as spaces of learning, healing and recreation, is a matter of human safety, and govts are under an obligation to protect life and health of citizens.In its order, the bench mentioned incidents of dog bites which grabbed headlines recently, including a Welsh entrepreneur being bitten during a morning run in Bengaluru and two coaches (from Kenya and Japan) being bitten in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Similar incidents in educational institutions, railway stations and hospitals were highlighted, including at Kannur railway station, where a rabid stray reportedly bit 18 people on a platform.It shall be the responsibility of the jurisdictional municipal body/authority to forthwith remove every stray dog found within the premises of an educational institution, hospital (public or private), sports complex, bus stand/depot (including inter-state bus terminals) or railway station, and to shift such animal/s to a designated shelter, after due sterilisation and vaccination, in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023,"" the bench said.""Stray dogs so picked up shall not be released back to the same location from which they were picked up. We have consciously directed the non-release of such stray dogs to the same location from which they were picked up, as permitting the same would frustrate the very effect of the directions issued to liberate such institutional areas from the presence of stray dogs,"" it said.No sooner had the bench read out the operating part of its order in open court than animal activists and dog lovers urged it not to sign the judgment and requested it to grant them a hearing. However, the bench turned down the request.It directed that the management or administrator of such institutions shall designate a nodal officer for the upkeep and cleanliness of premises, and ensuring that stray dogs do not enter or inhabit the campus. ""The recurrence of such incidents, particularly within institutional spaces meant for learning, healing and recreation, reflects not only administrative apathy but also a systemic failure to secure these premises from preventable hazards,"" the bench said.The situation calls for immediate judicial intervention to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens, especially children, students, patients and sportspersons, it said.The directions, SC said, are being issued in continuation of and in furtherance of its order, dated Aug 22, to ensure that the menace of stray dog attacks within institutional areas is curbed through effective preventive and administrative mechanisms. ""The primary objective is to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens...while ensuring compliance with the principles embodied in the ABC Rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,"" it said.It also directed chief secretaries of states and UTs to implement its direction and file status reports after eight weeks. The Animal Welfare Board has been directed to file a report on the nationwide status of sterilisation and vaccination drives as well as formulation of uniform standard operating procedures for prevention of dog-bite incidents. ""Any reported non-compliance of any of the above directions shall be viewed very seriously and may invite penalties/consequences including but not limited to the initiation of suo motu contempt proceedings against erring officials,"" the bench said.It said the administrative heads of these institutions shall through their respective local or municipal authorities, under the overall supervision of the district magistrate, ensure that premises are secured by fencing, boundary walls, gates and other such structures, or administrative measures as may be necessary to prevent the ingress of stray dogs.","India has one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates.

India inks $1 billion deal for 113 Tejas engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-inks-1-billion-deal-for-113-tejas-engines/articleshow/125171071.cms,"HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: India on Friday inked an over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) deal with US major General Electric (GE) for another 113 jet engines to power the much-delayed indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which may to some extent assuage the Trump administration amid the still raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The delivery of the 113 new GE-F404 engines to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe, which will add to the ongoing but also delayed supply of 99 such engines ordered under a Rs 5,375 crore deal inked in Aug 2021.With the new engine deal being inked in Bengaluru, HAL chief D K Sunil exuded confidence about the delivery of single-engine Tejas Mark-1A fighters finally beginning to the IAF. “We have 11 Tejas aircraft ready, including four fitted with the new GE engines. We are moving towards certification, and the aim is to deliver the first 10 jets to IAF by the end of March next year,” he told TOI.While the delay in the supply of the initial 99 engines was one of major reasons that hit the Tejas Mark-1A production, the jets have also been hobbled by pending trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles (ASRAAM) and laser-guided bombs as well as their integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. Down to just 29 fighter squadrons (each with 18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised, the force is banking upon the 180 `improved’ fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters to shore up its depleting numbers.Pakistan already has 25 fighter squadrons and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, in turn, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.The first contract for 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore, while another 97 were ordered for Rs 66,500 crore on Sept 25 this year. Deliveries of the initial 83 jets, however, are yet to begin.“Engines have the most lead time. Keeping that in mind this time, we started negotiations for the 113 new engines with GE even before we inked the 97 Tejas contract with IAF. So, we were able to close this deal so early,” Sunil said.As for the Tejas weapon trials, the HAL chief said, “Results of the data from the trials involving Astra and ASRAAMs are being analysed. Next, during Nov and Dec, we plan to begin the bombing trials. If GE delivers 10 engines in time, we don’t see any reason for delay in handing over 10 aircraft to the IAF by the end of this fiscal.”At present, HAL has four of the initial 99 engines, with the fifth slated to come later this month. As the supply stabilises, GE has promised to deliver 20 engines every year.HAL, in turn, has stated it will scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.Parallelly, HAL is negotiating the co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion, for the Tejas Mark-2 fighter.“Six rounds of talks on the technical terms and conditions with GE have taken place till now, which will be followed by the commercial negotiations. HAL hopes to conclude all negotiations by March 2026,” a defence ministry official said.","The delivery of the 113 new GE-F404 engines to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Tagore himself wanted it, hits back Congress, demands apology





‘Anthem of Independence’, mantra for Tagore, Gandhi, Savarkar: PM





NEW DELHI: PM Modi alleged Friday that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of ' Vande Mataram ' were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's Partition"", in what was seen as an attack on Congress in the midst of the Bihar elections and months before Bengal goes to the polls.Launching year-long celebrations to mark 150 years of the national song, where he recited all six stanzas, PM Modi warned that the ""same divisive mindset"" remained a challenge to the nation. ""The spirit of 'Vande Mataram' illuminated the entire nation during the freedom struggle. But unfortunately, in 1937, crucial verses of 'Vande Mataram', a part of its soul, were severed. 'Vande Mataram' was broken, torn into pieces,"" the PM said without naming anyone.""Why was this great mantra of nation-building treated with such injustice? This is crucial for today's generation to understand, because that same divisive thinking remains a challenge for the country even today,"" PM Modi said.Citing a letter from Rabindranath Tagore to Jawaharlal Nehru, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh claimed ""Gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song, and said PM Modi should apologise to the nation for calling the act a ""divisive ideology"".""It is a shameful statement from a man whose lies and distortions have no limits,"" he said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was the ""proud flagbearer"" of the song, which became the rallying cry for the freedom struggle. He alleged RSS never accepted the song and has stuck to its ""Namaste Sada Vatsale"". He added, ""Sangh Parivar supported the British against Indians, abused the Constitution, burned effigies of Bapu and Babasaheb Ambedkar.""Ramesh said Sabyasachi Bhattacharya's biography of 'Vande Mataram' gives the background to the CWC resolution of Oct 29, 1937, which adopted the song.PM Modi said the ""anthem of Independence"" was the mantra for Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Savarkar and Aurobindo, and the national flag designed by Bhikaji Cama had 'Vande Mataram' written on it.""In 1896, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore sang 'Vande Mataram' at the (Congress) Calcutta session. The partition of Bengal took place in 1905. This was a dangerous experiment by the British to divide the country. However, 'Vande Mataram' stood as a rock against those plans. There was only one voice on the streets protesting against the partition of Bengal: 'Vande Mataram',"" PM Modi saidReflecting on the relevance of the national song as a guiding force even today and the message it holds, the PM said, ""When the enemy dared to attack India's security and honour through terrorism, the entire world saw that India also knows how to become Durga to destroy terror"". The comments were seen as a reference to Operation Sindoor.Noting that Nov 7 also marked 11 years since the implementation of 'one rank one pension' for defence personnel, PM Modi said, ""When our armed forces crush the nefarious designs of the enemy, when terrorism, Naxalism, and Maoist insurgency are decisively defeated, our security forces are inspired by a single mantra - 'Vande Mataram'.""""For those who consider the nation as a geopolitical entity, the idea of considering the nation as a mother may be surprising. However, India is different. In India, a mother is both a mother and a nurturer. If a child faces a crisis, she is also a destroyer,"" PM said and pointed out how 'Vande Mataram' highlighted the immense power of 'Bharat Ma'.PM Modi said during the colonial era, the British sought to justify their rule by portraying India as inferior and backward. He emphasised that the very first line of 'Vande Mataram' powerfully dismantled this propaganda.Therefore, 'Vande Mataram' was not merely a song of freedom - it also presented to millions of Indians a vision of what a free India could be: the dream of a 'Sujalam Sufalam Bharat', he said.","PM Modi alleges that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of'Vande Mataram'were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's Partition"" Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh claimed ""Gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song.

Probe suggests SI Kumar died of head injury, say police



HISAR: A police officer was beaten to death allegedly by hooligans outside his home in Haryana's Hisar late Thursday. Sub-inspector Ramesh Kumar, 57, tried to stop the assailants from creating a ruckus in the neighbourhood but was allegedly battered with bricks and sticks. The officer's nephew was also injured in the attack. Police have arrested five suspects.Kumar was posted in the office of ADGP, Hisar range, and lived with his family. Around 11 pm, a group of men parked themselves on the street outside his home and began drinking and using abusive language.The sub-inspector asked the hooligans not to create a nuisance in a residential area. The group dispersed but returned 20 minutes later with a few more men and began creating a ruckus again. When SI Ramesh Kumar stepped out to confront the men, they set upon him and allegedly bludgeoned him with bricks and construction debris. The SI's nephew Amit Kumar rushed out to protect him but he too was attacked by the hooligans.When some neighbours stepped out after hearing their screams, the attackers fled, leaving behind a car and a couple of two-wheelers on which they had arrived. Both victims were rushed to Hisar general hospital, where doctors declared Ramesh dead on arrival.Amit is under treatment. Word quickly spread that a cop had been murdered. Additional director general of police KK Rao and SP Shashank Kumar Sawan rushed to the spot and inspected the scene.Multiple teams were sent after the accused. Five of them - Mahendra alias Gabbar, 54, his son Subhash alias Sahil, 20, Narendra, 28, Praveen alias Lalla, 33, and Jatin, 33 - were tracked down and caught. They tried to break free but were overpowered and arrested. Police said Narendra and Subhash suffered leg fractures while fleeing and Mahendra suffered a hand injury. Teams are out looking for at least five other suspects they have identified.Preliminary investigation suggests Ramesh died of a head injury, said SP Sawan. ""The accused and deceased's families are distantly related and live in the same locality.""Based on Amit's complaint, police registered a case against 10 people and several unidentified men for murder. Kumar is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.","Sub-inspector Ramesh Kumar, 57, tried to stop the assailants from creating a ruckus in the neighbourhood.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

Caste arithmetic in Gaura Bauram



Total electorate:

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

It only refers to the conversation between the two pilots of the plane, the top court said.""The scope of the AAIB investigation is not to blame but to suggest preventive measures to avoid future tragedies. If necessary, we will clarify that the pilot cannot be blamed,"" the bench said.The Supreme Court listed the matter for further hearing on November 10.Last month, the father of Pushkaraj Sabharwal Federation of Indian Pilots filed a petition demanding for a court-monitored inquiry headed by a former apex court judge.The 91-year-old demanded a ""fair, transparent and technically robust"" investigation into the incident.""An incomplete and prejudiced inquiry, without identification of the exact cause of the accident, endangers the lives of future passengers and undermines aviation safety at large, causing a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,"" his plea said.","Supreme Court says no one can blame the pilot-in-command of the Air India Boeing Dreamliner that crashed moments after taking off in Ahmedabad.

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.","Attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Observing that sale or purchase of immovable property is a distressing and traumatic task fraught with risk of fraud as it is still regulated by colonial laws, Supreme Court on Friday said the time has come to reform the procedure to make it simpler, transparent and fraud free by use of technology and making property registration a conclusive proof of ownership.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said property laws have long witnessed dichotomy between registration and ownership as registration does not confer ownership and this leads to massive litigation, which is 66 per cent of all civil disputes in the country. It said the problem could be addressed by achieving convergence of conclusive titling with registration, which is now possible due to technological advancement.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Narasimha said more than a century has passed and the country must dare to think and look for alternatives. The efficiency and transparency with which immovable property is bought and sold is demonstrative of a nation’s institutional maturity and a testament of the confidence and trust its citizens repose in the integrity of its legal framework, he said. The judgement can be a turning point in bringing much needed reform in transaction of real estate propertiesSC passed the order while quashing the Bihar govt’s decision to make ‘jamabandi’ — holding allotment — of a land mandatory before its transfer or sale.The court appreciated the intention of the state to synchronise the registrable document with real-time land holding but said the process of mutation and the process of survey and settlement are nowhere near completion.“Under these circumstances and considering the nascent stage at which the empirical data is translated as mutation into the relevant records, and the fact that for this purpose survey and settlement are to be conducted, interlinking and restraining registration till jamabandi is effected would be illegal, as it has a direct impact on the right and freedom to purchase and sale property,"" the bench said.SC said the present legal framework for purchase and sale of immovable properties suffers from several systemic deficiencies that undermine reliability, transparency and efficiency. It asked the Centre and the Law Commission to examine use of technology such as Blockchain in sale or purchase of property as it would address the problems related to fake and fraudulent property documents, land encroachments, role of intermediaries etc.“Fortunately, due to technological advancement this process is duly and more accurately achievable. We have incorporated emerging technologies as instruments of institutional reform. Blockchain technology has garnered particular attention for its potential to transform land registration into a more secure, transparent and tamper-proof system,” the bench said.“It is suggested that adoption of the technology would ensure immutability, transparency and traceability, thereby minimising fraud and unauthorised alterations. The technology is said to offer an alternative paradigm by encoding land titles, ownership histories, encumbrances, and by recording transfers on a ‘Distributed Ledger’ in an immutable and time stamped form,” it said.SC said each entry, once validated into the ‘Distributed Ledger, becomes part of a cryptographically linked chain of information that cannot be retroactively altered without detection, and this cryptographic immutability could perhaps address the structural fragility of the Indian record keeping system. “The Blockchain design could integrate cadastral maps, survey data and revenue records into a single verifiable framework, which, while maintaining a transparent audit trail, is accessible to multiple departments and the public,” it said.","Supreme Court says time has come to reform the procedure to make it simpler, transparent and fraud free by use of technology. Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said property laws have long witnessed dichotomy between registration and ownership as registration does not confer ownership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125167691,imgsize-530906,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"
'Up and functional': Airports Authority's update on technical glitch in Delhi; flight operations to be normal soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-300-flights-hit-technical-snag-triggers-chaos-at-delhi-airport-key-developments/articleshow/125157720.cms,"Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

What failed: AMSS breakdown and impact on flight-plan distribution

Scale of disruption: Number of flights delayed and average wait times

From automated to manual

Restoration efforts and status updates

Airlines update passenger advisories

The Airports Authority of India said that the air traffic control messaging system (AMSS) at Delhi airport was ""up and functional"", after a technical glitch disrupted over 800 flights. However, it said that due to ""some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations"".""The AMSS systems are up and functional now. Due to some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations, but the situation will be normal soon,"" it said in a post on X.Chaos erupted at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Friday after a glitch in the AMSS system caused over 800 flight delays, PTI reported citing sources. At least 20 flights have been cancelled, according to the report. The Mumbai airport also issued a statement announcing that its air traffic was impacted due to the malfunction.The glitch occurred in the AMSS system that prompted the ATC to abandon automation and switch to manual procedures. The slowdown began showing network-wide effects from Thursday afternoon.As India’s busiest hub, IGIA typically manages about 1,500 aircraft movements a day with peak rates near 60–70 per hour in normal conditions, leaving little slack when automation falters.The problem started at the Automatic Message Switching System, a system responsible for transferring the flight plan data to the air traffic controllers' screens, which crashed. This caused the controllers to process each data manually, significantly delaying the arrival and departure process. The disruption that began to impact the operations since Thursday 3pm, had been occurring since Wednesday evening.The technical failure has affected more than 100 flight operations as per PTI. The glitch has largely increased the wait times for all the passengers at the airport. The airport officials have assured the passengers that resolution efforts are under way.Air traffic control oversees aircraft movements in the sky and on the ground, keeping safe separation and efficient air traffic flow. The system that ingests flight plans, tracks positions, and streams real-time data to controllers’ consoles is automated. The Auto Track System presents this live picture to controllers for sequencing departures, arrivals, and taxi movements, while the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) relays high-volume flight plans, weather, and operational notices between ATC and airlines each day.Since these automated layers went down with technical failures, controllers were forced to shift to manual methods—noting flight details by hand, calculating separation standards, and coordinating via voice circuits—which preserves safety but greatly reduces throughput and creates operational choke points compared with normal automated rates.Announcing the expected delays due to manual processing, Airport Authority of India shared a post on their X on Friday stating, ""Flight operations at Delhi Airport are experiencing delays due to a technical issue in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS), which supports Air Traffic Control data. Controllers are processing flight plans manually, leading to some delays. Technical teams are working to restore the system at the earliest. ""Delhi Airport also shared the announcement on its Instagram. It assured the passengers of addressing the matter on a priority basis and asked them to stay in touch with their respective airlines for further advisories. ""We regret the disruption being experienced at IGIA due to a technical issue at ATC that is affecting flight operations. This matter is being addressed on priority with close coordination among ATC, DIAL, and other stakeholders. Passengers are requested to follow updates from their airlines regarding revised schedules. Thank you for your cooperation,"" it wrote.Following the disruptions, various airlines issued advisories for their respective flyers. IndiGo announced that the AMSS system is being resolved and shared a link for the passengers to check the latest flight status before flying. ""Customers with upcoming departures are advised to check the latest flight status before starting their journey and to arrive at the airport a little earlier than usual to allow additional time for travel formalities,"" IndiGo wrote.SpiceJet assured its flyers that, amidst the delay chaos, its ground staff is present at the airport to assist the passengers. ""Our crew and ground teams are assisting passengers and working closely with the authorities to minimise the impact and resume normal operations as soon as possible,"" they wrote further, asking the passengers to keep checking the flight status.Air India, while regretting for the delay, also asked the passengers to keep in touch with the updates about their flights so that they could efficiently manage their travel time. ""Our cabin crew and on-ground staff at the airport are extending immediate assistance to reduce passenger inconvenience,"" they wrote, ""We request you to check your flight status before heading to the airport.""Akasa Air announced the longer wait times at the airport for the passengers as the situation was beyond their control. ""This may lead to longer wait times at the airport and delays for some of our flights. While this situation is beyond our control, we sincerely regret the inconvenience to your travel plans and seek your understanding during these times,"" read its post on X.Air India Express also shared a notice asking for patience and advising passengers to check the flight status before heading to the airport. ""Our Cabin Crew and Airport Services teams are doing their best to assist you,"" the notice read, ""Before heading to the airport, please check your flight status.""The delays for departing flights, as reflected on Flightradar24.com, showed around 50 minutes from the Delhi airport.","A technical glitch at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport caused over 800 flight delays.

BUDGAM: J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday attacked the PDP , accusing it of betraying people’s trust in 2014 by joining hands with the BJP after the assembly polls to form the govt in the state.He was addressing a gathering in Budgam, the assembly constituency going to vote in the bypoll on November 11. Omar had vacated the seat he won in last year’s assembly polls in the state along with his traditional seat of Ganderbal.“This seat will have no impact on the NC government, but we cannot overlook its significance. This election can send out several important messages,” he said.“A year ago, my colleagues and I asked you to vote for me so that we could keep the BJP out of power and form our own government. The people accepted that appeal and gave us their mandate, and we have remained steadfast in our principles, staying away from the BJP,” he said.“Earlier, another party also sought votes on the same slogan,” Omar said. “In 2014 our rival PDP asked people to vote for them to keep the BJP out. And from Qazigund to Kupwara, people did so. But they betrayed that trust. The very next day, PDP joined hands with BJP and formed the govt.”The CM blamed the PDP-BJP alliance of 2014-2015 for the political changes that followed in J&K, including the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and downgrading of J&K from a state to a union territory.“What happened in 2019 and after was because of that alliance,” Omar said.The CM said that had the NC, like PDP, formed a governmentt with BJP after last year’s elections, Jammu and Kashmir could have become a state. “But I was not ready to deceive my mandate,” he said.Despite being a UT CM, Omar said, his govt has carried out developmental works in the region. “I vacated the Budgam seat because the law does not allow holding two constituencies. But I have continued to work for Budgam,” he said, announcing that Budgam would be developed as a model assembly constituency and that a university would be established here.There are three main contestants in Budgam — NC’s Aga Syed Mehmood, PDP’s Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, and BJP’s Aga Syed Mohsin. With NC MP Aga Ruhullah, a former MLA from Budgam, staying away from the party’s campaign and accusing the leadership of abandoning the struggle for the restoration of Article 370, the NC is pushing hard to win the seat to send a message to both the PDP and its own dissenting MP that it remains popular among the people.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah accuses PDP of betraying people's trust in 2014.

Sprinkling being done across city to suppress dust: Sirsa

NEW DELHI: As smog thickens in Delhi and people complain of burning eyes, scratchy throats and breathing problems, are the official air quality monitors accurately reflecting the capital's air quality? A ground check by TOI at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.At Anand Vihar - a pollution hot spot - the area around the monitoring unit was being repeatedly doused with water using high-pressure hoses. The practice, officials on site said, was part of routine dust suppression. Experts said such measures can distort readings.At Dilshad Garden, the AQI was in 'poor' zone but better than most other spots in the afternoon. The station is deep in a forested patch of a medical institute - covered by trees and away from the city dust and traffic.Similarly, the Mandir Marg station stood within a green belt and remained largely inaccessible, while at ITO, the monitor was located next to a regularly sprinkled stretch.At Lodhi Road, two stations barely a few blocks from each other, gave readings that differed by as much as 80 points at the same time.These observations raise serious questions over the credibility and representativeness of the capital's air quality network.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, defended the data. ""How would we suppress the dust? It's natural, through sprinkling. It is being done throughout the city, including around stations. We are successfully able to control pollution,"" he said. Experts, meanwhile, warned that excessive sprinkling near stations is ""unethical"" and could mislead both policymakers and the public.""These are state-of-the-art stations approved by all relevant agencies, designed to capture air quality over a two to three kilometre radius,"" said M P George, former additional director, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). ""They measure a well-mixed air package, so cleaning one small patch doesn't change the bigger picture."" He added that while there's no concrete study linking water sprinkling to altered AQI readings, such actions increase humidity and are more cosmetic than corrective. ""In fact, they can be counterproductive - higher humidity promotes secondary particulate formation. Sprinkling near monitors serves no scientific purpose.""Manoj Kumar from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) agreed that sprinkling may briefly lower particulate levels near sensors but said it doesn't change overall air quality. ""The worst pollution peaks occur in early morning and late evening, when sprinkling doesn't happen. So, while readings may look cleaner for a few hours, overall exposure remains hazardous,"" he said.Sunil Dahiya, founder of Envirocatalysts, said there was no evidence of post-collection data tampering but the choice of locations - often inside green or shielded areas - and nearby sprinkling clearly influence results. ""Such practices give a false sense of safety and prevent citizens, especially vulnerable groups, from taking precautions. They also distort forecasting and policy responses.""Environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari went a step further, calling it a case of ""cleaning data, not air."" ""These sensors measure pollution through light scattering. When mist or water is sprayed nearby, it suppresses dust and alters humidity, creating an artificially 'clean' AQI that may appear 50-90% better for a few hours. It's detectable - sudden humidity spikes and abrupt PM2.5 drops are red flags. When this happens under official watch, it's data distortion, not management,"" she said.Lawyer and environmentalist Akash Vashishtha said air pollution control must be rooted in accuracy, not optics. ""Prevention, control and abatement can only work when data is truthful. Hiding reality doesn't bring relief - it delays real solutions. The govt must ensure monitors are placed in representative, high-footfall and industrial areas, not in pockets of greenery,"" he said.",A ground check by TOI at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee fell victim to cyber fraud , with around Rs 56 lakh siphoned off from his bank account using another 'dormant' account linked to him.The bank has filed a complaint with Kolkata Police's cybercrime unit, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. Between 2001 and 2006, when Banerjee was the MLA from Asansol South, an account was opened in his name, along with other legislators, at a public sector bank's legislative assembly sub-branch, which is under the high court branch. All his allowances as an MLA were deposited into this account.Banerjee, who is now an MP from Serampore, stated that there were no transactions in this old account for a long time, rendering it a 'dormant' account.

Banerjee said the manager of the HC branch called him up on Thursday to inform him about the fraud.Police suspect that using the MP's photo and mobile number, Rs 56 lakh was transferred from his Kalighat branch account to the 'dormant' account, and subsequently, the entire amount was withdrawn. ""The fraudster forged a PAN and Aadhaar card by superimposing a different image on the apparently genuine documents.

Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

Flights & security nods managed manually; delays affect arrivals too





NEW DELHI: Delhi airport's aging air traffic control (ATC) software crashed Friday after a glitch the previous evening remained unresolved, delaying 800-odd departures and arrivals at India's busiest civil aviation facility by up to two hours. The ripple effect forced carriers to cancel around 100 flights across routes through the day.Airports Authority of India, accused of going slow on the software upgrade necessary for operations at the scale of Delhi airport, said late Friday that the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) system was back to being fully functional. ""Due to some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations, but the situation will be normal soon,"" it said.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered a probe into the AMSS glitch. Officials ruled out the possibility of a cyber attack triggering the chaos. Several airlines warned that some of their flights scheduled for the weekend could feel the after-effect of Friday's mayhem.With aircraft unable to land on time in Delhi, operations were affected in many other airports, including Mumbai.AMSS is used by airlines to file flight plans 24 hours in advance for arrivals and departures from Delhi as well as for aircraft overflying Delhi airspace.With the automated system going on the blink, all flight plan information had to be fed manually into the database. A new Air Traffic Services Message Handling System (ATSMHS) is being installed.Delhi airport currently handles about 1,550 flights daily and hundreds of aircraft overfly Delhi airspace. Manual processing of data, which isn't immune to errors, takes four times longer. For the better part of Friday, tracking site Flightradar24 showed Delhi as the most disrupted airport in terms of delayed flights.AAI wrote on X Friday night that the AMSS issue was detected on Thursday. ""Immediately, a review meeting was conducted and necessary directions were given to address the issues. The original equipment manufacturer was engaged and additional staff deployed to manually process flight plans for ATC system to ensure uninterrupted and safe air traffic operations...We regret the inconvenience caused to airlines and passengers,"" it said.Amid the chaos, IndiGo advised passengers travelling to and from Delhi to check ""the latest flight status and arrive a little earlier than usual to allow additional time at the airport"". Air India warned of ""delays and longer wait times at the airport and onboard aircraft"". Representatives of multiple airlines said the Delhi AMSS system had a history of glitches.""We have been hearing about the new AHMS system, but it is taking too long to install. In India, we need to file flight plans with different flight information regions (FIRs) - Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai - according to the region where a flight is operating.

Will coordinate with organisations & depts for shelter maintenance: MCD



NEW DELHI: Following the Supreme Court order on removal of strays from public spaces, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) said the primary responsibility for restricting their entry into such premises will rest with the heads of the institutions, reports Vibha Sharma.An MCD official said Supreme Court categorically instructed in-charges of these establishments to ensure fencing and prevent feeding or entry of stray dogs on the premises. ""In case strays are found, MCD will arrange for their immediate capture and transfer to shelters. A direction is expected soon from Delhi govt to all departments and institutions,"" the official added.The MCD currently operates 20 Animal Birth Control (ABC) centres through 13 NGOs, each deploying a vehicle per zone for catching stray dogs, in addition to the vehicles provided by the corporation itself. However, councillors have flagged that 2-3 centres, including those in Timarpur and Rohini, remain non-functional, increasing the workload on others. Officials said notice has been issued to the NGOs concerned to restart full-fledged operations or risk their sites being re-allotted to other agencies.Mayor Sardar Raja Iqbal Singh said, ""MCD will enhance coordination with animal welfare organisations and departments concerned to ensure the establishment and maintenance of shelters across the city.The goal is to keep Delhi a safe, compassionate, and well-organised city, where the welfare of both citizens and animals is ensured.""Residents, meanwhile, alleged that the Delhi govt has been ""merely filing affidavits and replies in court is happening on the ground"".Saurabh Gandhi, resident of Rana Pratap Bagh and general secretary of the United Residents of Delhi (URD), said, ""In our colony, 2 dogs dangerously attacked several elderly residents and children last month. We repeatedly complained to the MCD veterinary department to comply with the SC order. After much delay, they picked up an attacking dog on Oct 22 but released it back on Oct 29. Out of desperation, we have now filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. ""In line with earlier SC directions to establish designated feeding spots for stray dogs, MCD said it has identified 292 locations across 80 wards, where signboards are being installed. To accommodate aggressive or biting dogs, MCD's veterinary department has earmarked a 2.5-acre plot in Dwarka Sector 23 for constructing a dedicated shelter home. Although budgetary provisions were made, work has been pending for a long time. ""A meeting may soon be convened with the Commissioner to issue fresh directions to the engineering wing to accelerate the project,"" an official said.MCD has yet to release this year's budget for sterilisation and immunisation of stray dogs for the ongoing financial year (2025-26). The civic body reimburses NGOs and veterinary professionals Rs 1,000 per dog for sterilisation and vaccination, with payments released after a joint inspection team verifies the procedures - typically within 2-3 months.Former Union minister Vijay Goel welcomed the court's intervention as ""a step in the right direction"". ""When two foreign coaches were bitten by stray dogs at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, India's image was damaged. Stray dogs should be removed not only from public places but also from residential colonies, parks, tourist spots, airports, court premises, and other public areas. I appeal to dog lovers to adopt or feed them at shelter homes so that society remains both safe and sensitive,"" he said.","MCD says responsibility for restricting entry into such premises will rest with heads of institutions.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

A 'mix' no one asked for

Borewells to plug gap

Hidden toll on health

Scores of plaints, one reply

NOIDA: Every winter, as toxic smog shrouds Delhi-NCR, air pollution dominates headlines and dinner-table conversations. Masks return, air purifiers hum and social media fills with outrage. But in Sector 7x, a cluster of 43 high-rise societies home to over one lakh residents, another crisis unfolds quietly, every day of the year. One that doesn't cloud the horizon, but flows from the tap.Residents say the high level of total dissolved solids (TDS)-a measure of soluble hydrogen carbonate ions, chloride salts, sulphates, magnesium, etc-in the tap water supplied by Noida Authority leaves skin dry and dull, damages appliances, causes stomach ailments and forces them to spend thousands of rupees on water cans and filters.Across multiple societies, water samples have shown TDS readings between 1,000 and 3,500 mg/L - and in at least one case, more than 6,500 mg/L. The safe and acceptable limit for drinking water, as set by the Bureau of Indian Standards, is 500 mg/L.""We talk about clean air every winter as if it's the only environmental crisis,"" Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, said. ""For us, water is the bigger emergency.It has been for nearly a decade.""Sector 7x was marketed as a premium residential area with gleaming towers, landscaped parks and wide roads. Developers promised 24x7 Ganga water that draws from the Upper Ganga Canal. Residents say what they got instead is a concoction of groundwater blended with 30% Ganga water.""The groundwater here is naturally high in minerals. Combined with inadequate treatment, the result is hard, salty, undrinkable water. RO filters clog and turn black within one or two months, requiring frequent replacements. I end up spending Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 every year just to keep the RO systems functioning,"" VK Gupta of Supertech Capetown in Sector 74 said.RO-filtered bottled water costs Rs 30-Rs 90 for a 20-litre can. For large families, that adds up to several thousand rupees a month.Fed up with the apathy, Civitech Stadia (Sector 79) residents last month commissioned a private laboratory, Amlo Laboratories Pvt Ltd in Sector 10, to test the water. The report, dated Oct 27, found TDS was 6,538 mg/L, a level experts classify as unfit for drinking without industrial-grade purification.A similar test of water samples at Prateek Wisteria by Evergreen Enviro Testing LLP, based out of Surajpur Site B, in Aug recorded the TDS level at 1,711 mg/L.Each test report, shared with the Noida Authority and reviewed by TOI, tells a version of the same story: excessively hard water, above permissible limits, unsuitable even for daily chores.In an open letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Gupta argued that officials were deflecting blame by suggesting societies were choosing to use borewells over piped water supplied by Noida Authority. ""Why would anyone voluntarily use borewell water when it has such high TDS?"" he wrote. ""We don't choose it. We are forced into it.""Gupta claimed the Authority is mandated to supply Ganga water for six hours a day. ""Yet most societies receive three to four hours at best, which is inadequate to meet the needs of the families.""Low water pressure and supply shortage too leave several societies on the brink. At Antriksh Golf View 2 in Sector 78, residents say they have ordered 20-25 private tankers a day for nearly three months at a staggering expense. A single tanker of 20,000 litres costs between Rs 1,350 and Rs 2,000.""The dream of living in a high-rise comes with an asterisk here: buy your own water,"" Ranjan Samantaray of Antriksh told TOI.While the social media debates focus on particulate matter, doctors warn that prolonged consumption of high-TDS water can contribute to kidney strain, gastric irritation and mineral imbalance. Hard water can cause dry skin, dandruff and hair fall.Rajesh Yadav, a resident of Civitech Stadia, says complaints of stomach-related illnesses are routine. ""We use RO water even for cooking. We don't trust what comes from the tap,"" he said. ""People in Delhi-NCR worry about what they breathe. We also worry about what we drink.""Some have taken to posting photographs of brownish tap water on resident WhatsApp groups - water that stains clothes, scales geysers, corrodes bathroom fittings and clogs washing machines.""The symptoms of contaminated water show up at the dermatologist's clinic or kitchens lined with empty water cans. Hair fall is so common in these parts of the city. So many families have had to install water softeners for bathroom showers and kitchen sinks.

CJI questions renewal clause in tribunal law



NEW DELHI: Attorney general R Venkataramani apologised on Friday to Supreme Court following CJI B R Gavai deploring the Centre's plea for referring to a five-judge bench midway through hearing on challenges to the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act and two days later excoriating a request for adjourning a scheduled hearing.Venkataramani appeared before the bench through video conference and said, ""I am tendering a volley of apologies for inconveniencing the court. I will appear before the bench in person on Monday and present my submissions on the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act.""The AG said, ""I will explain why the government has taken a particular stand. However, the concerns raised by the petitioners who have challenged the validity of certain provisions can be taken into consideration and, if possible, ironing out of creases can be done. The Supreme Court can tell us the creases...""The bench of the CJI and Justice K Vinod Chandran said on Thursday itself it had told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that it would accommodate Attorney general R Venkataramani's request for absence on Friday and that he could present his arguments on Monday.""But, on Monday either you (the AG) leave international arbitration or entrust Bhati to argue the case,"" the chief justice said, clarifying that no further request for adjournment would be entertained.The tribunal reforms law prescribes uniform tenures of four years for the members and chairpersons of various tribunals, including NCLT, NCLAT, CAT, CESTAT, APTEL, TDSAT, ITAT, and DRT. One of the major grievances of the petitioners, as articulated by senior advocate Arvind Datar, was that because of the short tenure of appointments, the tribunals which discharge important adjudicatory functions do not attract youngsters and only retired persons apply for the posts.He said the promise of renewal of tenure would destroy the independence of tribunals and pleaded that a robust independent tribunal system is needed. CJI Gavai agreed with the view and asked, ""If the tribunal members and chairperson are dependent on the government for the renewal of their tenures, then would it not impinge upon the independence of judicial functions of the tribunals?""",Attorney general R Venkataramani apologised on Friday to Supreme Court.

Opposition protests against SIR, including Rahul Gandhi's 'voter adhikaar' yatra, also ensured the Bihar poll campaign began early. ""The sharp divisions over SIR created a high level of contestation, generating public interest and encouraging electors to vote,"" said an officer.Interestingly, the difference between Bihar's Phase 1 turnout and its 2024 Lok Sabha turnout-8.4 percentage points-nearly matches the 8.7% deletions from the June 2025 roll that listed 7.9 crore electors.Officials said it's hard to assess how much SIR deletions contributed to higher turnout. ""SIR eliminated bogus entries - of dead, shifted or ineligible - which earlier enabled impersonation,"" said an EC officer.They added that EC's resolve in conducting SIR exercise amid criticism, and high media scrutiny motivated voters to turn up in large numbers.","The net deletion of around 47 lakh electors from Bihar's rolls during the special intensive revision (SIR) is among factors that may have pushed up Phase 1 polling percentage to record levels.

NEW DELHI: Murder case of a Nationalist Congress Party functionary of Chhattisgarh will again haunt Amit Jogi, son of former chief minister Ajit Jogi, as Supreme Court on Thursday revived the case against him, 18 years after his acquittal.The murder of NCP's Ramavatar Jaggi took place in 2003 and it was alleged that the conspiracy was hatched at the CM's residence as his father was governing the state at that time. The case was transferred to CBI and trial court acquitted him in 2007 while convicting 20 other accused. The state, thereafter, filed the appeal in HC. CBI also moved HC but after a delay of almost 1,400 days, challenging his acquittal.But HC rejected the plea of state govt as well as CBI on different grounds, virtually bringing the case against Jogi to an end. Rejecting the appeal of state, HC had said that the case was being probed by the central agency and the state had no locus in appeal. It also said that the appeal by CBI was filed by inordinate delay of 1,373 days and refused to condone the delay. The state and CBI thereafter moved SC.Allowing the plea of CBI, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the case was sensitive and HC should have taken a more liberal and pragmatic approach in dealing with CBI's applicatio.Court condoned the delay, paving way for HC to examine appeal against Jogi's acquittal in 2007.CBI urged that the delay was bona fide; and as it was under an impression that the state had filed an appeal against the acquittal and it was not considered necessary for CBI to challenge the acquittal. It said the agency moved the HC when locus of the state to file the leave to appeal was questioned.Allowing CBI's plea, the bench said, ""Though CBI filed an application seeking leave to appeal after a significant delay of 1,373 days, it is equally true that the charges against the respondent, Amit Jogi, were grave, involving conspiracy to murder a member of a rival political party. The judgment of acquittal was under challenge at the instance of the state govt and the de-facto complainant and thus, the proceedings were still alive. Therefore, we are of the opinion that HC ought to have adopted a more liberal and pragmatic approach in dealing with CBI's application seeking condonation of delay and should have examined application seeking leave to appeal applicable on its merits"".""We may hasten to add that we are not giving any imprimatur to the explanation offered by CBI in its application for condonation of delay, but our objective is to ensure that the case involving such grave allegations should not be thrown out on mere technicalities,"" it said. The court remitted the matter to HC for fresh consideration of the application for grant of leave to appeal filed by CBI, on merit.","Court condoned the delay, paving way for HC to examine appeal against Jogi's acquittal in 2007.

Donald Trump Calls PM Modi A 'Great Friend', Says India Visit 'Could Be' Next Year Amid Talks

Trade talks with India have progressed, says Trump





NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has said he may travel to India next year, adding that PM Modi ""wants"" him to visit.""He's a friend of mine, and we speak... He wants me to go there. We will figure that out. I will go. I will have a great trip there with Prime Minister Modi, he's a great man. And I'll be going,"" Trump said Thursday in response to a question. Asked if the visit could happen next year, Trump said, ""It could be, yeah.""India is due to host the next Quad summit with leaders from Australia, Japan, and US, after the 2024 meeting in Delaware. However, dates are yet to be announced. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in New Delhi declined to comment on the visit. ""I will let you know when I have (information),"" Jaiswal said.On trade, Donald Trump claimed progress in talks with India and repeated his assertion that India had reduced oil imports from Russia. ""It's great, going good. He (PM Modi) stopped... Largely, he stopped buying oil from Russia,"" he said.Trump had imposed 25% reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25% levy on purchases of Russian oil, taking total levy to 50%.India had called the measures ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"".Trump also revisited an oft-repeated claim: that he stopped a war between India and Pakistan using tariffs. ""Of the eight wars I ended, five or six were ended because of tariffs,"" he said. ""If you take a look at India and Pakistan, they started to fight - they are two nuclear nations... And I said, 'Listen, if you guys are going to fight, I'm gonna put tariffs on you.' Within 24 hours, I settled the war. If I didn't have tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to settle that war. "" Trump called tariffs a ""great national defence.""On May 10, he announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington. He has since repeated that claim more than 60 times.","US President Donald Trump has said he may travel to India next year, adding that PM Modi ""wants"" him to visit.

MOHALI: After an eight-year-hunt, Mohali police have arrested Gaurav Kumar, wanted for the double murder of senior journalist KJ Singh and his mother, Gurcharan Kaur. Kumar was arrested in Noida Thursday.Kumar frequently changed cities and jobs to avoid detection and had managed to build a new identity for himself, say police. His employers were stunned to learn that he was an absconder in a high-profile murder case.The ""model worker"" had been promoted from security guard to manager at a construction firm in the last few years and had married. But police stayed on his trail. The chase turned into a sprint in the last 10 days when tips from elders in his village turned the cold trail hot. Kumar was taken completely by surprise when a team from Mohali police's ""Proclaimed Offenders Staff"" surrounded him. He has been brought to Mohali and will be produced in court.The Singhs were found murdered at their home in Mohali during the intervening night of September 22-23, 2017. The killings sent shockwaves across Punjab.SSP Harmandeep Singh Hans said sustained surveillance and intelligence inputs finally led to the accused.""The motive of murder was spontaneous. KJ Singh saw this man sitting near the boundary wall of his house and asked him to go away. The other man got offended and entered his house to kill him and his mother,"" Hans said.Police identified Kumar as the suspect and registered a case at Mataur police station on September 23, 2017. But Kumar was nowhere to be found. He was declared a proclaimed offender in 2022.DSP Naveen Pal Singh said that when the case was handed to him, he and his team began ""connecting evidence"" and went to Kumar's native village. With the help of sarpanches and panches, police traced him to Noida, where he was caught. Singh said, ""He was traced to a construction site in Noida. He joined the firm as a security guard and was elevated to supervisor before being made manager of the project. According to his employer, his conduct was very good. ..

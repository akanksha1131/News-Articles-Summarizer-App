NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma Taking to X after India's decisive victory against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following backlash over her comments, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to respond, taking a dig at the Congress party's electoral failures. ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A.

NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India. ""Sukhvinder, CEO and founder of Vuenow Group is 'mastermind' of the scam who in connivance with his close aides orchestrated the 'Cloud Particle Scam',"" ED said.","Sukhvinder and Dimple Kharour masterminded multi-level marketing fraud.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing concerns over unity of opposition INDIA bloc in the wake of BJP's political victories, a push from a section that it should revive its sense of purpose as during 2024 Lok Sabha elections is meeting with strong roadblocks. The main hurdle in getting the alliance together to convey a joint resolve is said to be the coming elections which will see INDIA bloc parties take on each other as rivals. Congress sources said while there is no view against an INDIA bloc meeting, there is no agenda at hand to hold one either, while coordination between the allies in Parliament is going well, as witnessed during the last two sessions. ""If any immediate agenda crops up, there can be a get together, but presently there is none,"" sources said.However, sources in non-Congress alliance parties said three elections lined up in 2026 and 2027, for which preparations have started, are creating complications, and political dissonance among allies will only get shriller with time. ""They have made the situation complex for greater show of unity and purpose,"" an INDIA bloc member said.Assembly elections in Bengal are scheduled for early 2026, followed by those in Kerala in mid-2026, and in Punjab in early 2027. If an alliance does not fructify between TMC and Congress in Bengal, the state battle will have three allies, including Left, fighting against each other. It was Congress and Left which contested as a marginal bloc against TMC in 2021, while TMC and BJP slugged it out as the main players.Besides, Congress and AAP will be main opponents in AAP-governed Punjab, continuing the face-off between the two in the Delhi elections in Feb, which BJP won. Then, Congress and Left will be the main rivals in Left-ruled Kerala.While Congress, CPM-led Left and TMC faced-off against each other in Lok Sabha polls too, AAP had tied up with Congress. Many believe holding a joint political show at this moment will undercut their posturing as fierce rivals on their home turfs. ""It is the reason why I feel it would be difficult to hold an INDIA meeting,"" an opposition member said.The opposition platform, cobbled ahead of Lok Sabha polls, came together seamlessly and ensured a state-wise seat-sharing formula that helped the allies challenge BJP and perform better than expected in the polarisation-propelled contest.But the bloc has since lost its unity, with allies sparring politically, and also fighting against each other in elections, as was the case in Haryana and Maharashtra polls. Renewed BJP upsurge has led to many opposition parties emphasising the need to bring about fresh cohesion in INDIA bloc.",There are growing concerns over unity of opposition INDIA bloc in the wake of BJP's political victories.

NEW DELHI: In a significant blow to international drug cartels , Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) secured convictions in a dozen cases across country in first two months of the year.The convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday.In a post on X, Shah said, ""Modi government is unsparing in punishing drug traffickers who drag our youth into the dark abyss of addiction for the greed of money. As a result of a foolproof investigation with a bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom strategy, 29 drug traffickers have been convicted by the court in 12 different cases across India. We pledge to continue combating the drug menace with ruthless and meticulous investigations to build a drug-free Bharat.""The convictions happened in Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Dehradun, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata and Lucknow between Jan and Feb.Convictions under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are challenging to secure due to stringent requirements of proof and need to establish culpability beyond reasonable doubt. "" NDPS Act mandates that prosecution prove the accused's guilt through credible search and seizures besides clear links, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in cases where the accused may have taken steps to conceal their involvement,"" an officer said. Further, the Act's emphasis on need for corroborative evidence, such as witness testimony or forensic analysis, makes it harder to secure convictions.The cases where convictions happened involved seizure of narcotics, including charas, ganja, heroin and opium. The convicted individuals were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment ranging from one to 15 years, along with fines.According to NCB, in Ahmedabad, three individuals were convicted and sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh each for possessing 23.8kg charas. In Bhopal, four individuals were convicted and sentenced to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2 lakh each for trafficking 123kg ganja.In Chandigarh, two individuals were convicted and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000 each for attempting to transport 438g opium to Canada. A Zimbabwean national was convicted and sentenced to 11 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3 lakh for possessing 2.9kg heroin in Kochi.","Convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty.

The complainant invoked various IPC offences and the Prevention of Corruption Act for suspected offences of criminal misconduct by public servants and illegal gratification.The February 1 order by Special Judge S E Bangar said, “There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe.”Sebi, in a statement on Sunday, said it would be initiating appropriate legal steps to challenge this order and remains committed to ensuring due regulatory compliance in all matters.The court order was in response to a private complaint filed by one Sapan Shrivastava . He said he is a media person and was seeking directions for the registration of an FIR and probe against Buch, 60, and others. The others include Ashwani Bhatia, Ananth Narayan, Kamlesh Varshney—all three whole time members of Sebi, and Pramd Agarwal, Chairman and Public Interest Director (BSE), and Sundararaman Ramamurthy, MD and CEO, BSE.The court said it would monitor the investigation.On Sunday, Sebi also stated, “Even though these officials were not holding their respective positions at the relevant point of time, the court allowed the application without issuing any notice or granting any opportunity to Sebi to place the facts on record.”The application before the court sought probe into “alleged offences committed by the proposed accused involving large-scale financial fraud, regulatory violations, and corruption.” The court noted that the allegations pertain to the fraudulent listing of a company on the stock exchange with the active connivance of regulatory authorities, particularly Sebi, without compliance under the Sebi Act, 1992, and rules and regulations thereunder.The complainant alleged that Sebi officials failed in their statutory duty, facilitated market manipulation, and enabled corporate fraud by allowing the listing of a company that did not meet the prescribed norms.Shrivastava, a Dombivali resident, arguing in person, said despite approaching the police station and regulatory bodies “on multiple occasions no action has been taken, necessitating judicial intervention under Section 156(3) CrPC (criminal procedure code).” The section empowers the court to direct police to take action if a cognizable offence is made out.The order noted that the “allegations disclose a cognizable offence, necessitating an investigation.”The court said the complaint alleged “procedural lapses and noncompliance in the IPO process, leading to an irregular listing of the company” and cited documents, also “placed on record,” “Regulatory filings and stock market reports indicating artificial inflation of share prices and market manipulation.”The special court analysed the law and referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 2015, which set out that a private application must be supported by an affidavit ensuring due diligence and the “Magistrate must be satisfied that a prima facie case exists before directing an investigation.” The court, on reviewing the material before it, also observed that the “inaction by law enforcement and Sebi necessitates judicial intervention.”The Judge said, “Considering the gravity of allegations, applicable laws, and settled legal precedents, this court deems it appropriate to direct an investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC.”The court said thus, “The concerned Anti Corruption Bureau, Worli, Mumbai Region, Mumbai is directed to register an FIR under the relevant provisions of IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, Sebi Act, and other applicable laws.”The BSE in a statement on Sunday evening said it is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps after seeing the special court order.The statement issued by BSE said the company mentioned in the order is ""Cals Refineries Ltd.'' listed in 1994 when officials named in the plea were ""not in their respective positions...and were not connected with the company at all.'' BSE said, ""The application is frivolous and vexatious.''Like Sebi, BSE too said no notice was issued to it nor was it given an opportunity to place facts on record.It said, ""BSE is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps in this regard. As a responsible market institution, BSE remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance and ensuring transparency''",A special Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court in Mumbai on Saturday directed the agency to file a first information report (FIR) against former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch. The order is for a probe into alleged irregularities in granting listing permission to a company on the Bombay Stock Exchange.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118663756,imgsize-775875,width-400,resizemode-4/118663756.jpg"

Their families were informed only hours before their journey to Jordan on Feb 5. The two remained in contact until Feb 9, after which they attempted to cross into Israel through a mountainous valley on Feb 10.

NEW DELHI: The ISRO will resume experiments on the SpaDeX mission in mid-March by trying to separate the two satellites – Chaser and Target – and re-dock them again as it attempts to master the technologies for future projects. The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30 last year when it placed in orbit two satellites – SDX01 and SDX02 – to demonstrate the docking experiment in space. After several attempts, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was successful in docking the two satellites on January 16.""Currently, the unified satellite is in an elliptical orbit. So, we get a 10-15 days window once in two months to conduct various experiments,"" ISRO Chairman V Narayanan told PTI on the sidelines of the National Science Day celebrations here.He said the window for carrying out experiments on the SpaDeX satellites will be available from March 15.""Right now, we are doing simulation experiments for separation of satellites and re-docking them. We have charted out a plan and will start the actual experiments from March 15,"" Narayanan said.Ahead of the mission's launch, the ISRO had said after successful docking and rigidization, it planned to demonstrate electrical power transfer between the two satellites before undocking and separation.""We want to do multiple experiments. There is a lot of propellant onboard. We also have experiments lined up for the third slot that would be available after two months,"" Narayanan said.He said the SpaDeX mission is a fore-runner for several future projects such as the Chandrayaan-4, building of the Bharat Antariksha Station which will involve use of docking technologies.Earlier, Union Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh flagged off the e-Tractor and e-Tiller developed by CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur.","The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30 last year when it placed in orbit two satellites – SDX01 and SDX02 – to demonstrate the docking experiment in space.

Karnataka to see 'rotational CM'? MLA claims Shivakumar will take over in December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-to-see-rotational-cm-mla-claims-shivakumar-will-take-over-in-december/articleshow/118665774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MLA Basavaraju V Shivaganga on Sunday claimed that deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar will ascend to the position of chief minister by December. He predicted that Shivakumar would continue as chief minister for 7.5 years from December, anticipating the party's success in forthcoming Assembly elections.""Write it down, it will happen by December. I can also write and give it to you in blood if you want, that he (Shivakumar) will become CM by December. If he takes charge in December, he will run the administration, including the next five-year term too, so by and large, he will be CM for 7.5 years,"" Shivaganga said.When questioned about a potential power-sharing agreement, the Channagiri MLA highlighted Shivakumar's party contributions, noting his role in improving the party's performance in both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.""He (Shivakumar) has made history. He has organised the party, invested his resources, and sacrificed a lot for it. His silence or composure should not be mistaken for weakness. The high command is aware of everything, and I am a hundred per cent sure he will be CM by December,"" he said.Discussions within Karnataka's political circles, particularly in the ruling Congress, suggest a possible leadership transition later this year under a ""rotational chief minister"" arrangement.Shivakumar, currently serving as Karnataka Congress president, has openly expressed his aspirations for the chief minister's position.Shivaganga declared his steadfast support for Shivakumar, committing to back any decision the leader makes.""If he (Shivakumar) doesn't get justice, then being in the Congress party is pointless. It is because of his organisational efforts that 75-80 of us were newly elected. He is essential for the party, and we are confident that the high command will make him CM,"" he added.The MLA assured that Shivakumar's elevation to CM would occur through Congress' own strength. ""It is our right. We will demand it, and the high command will recognise his efforts,"" he maintained.After Congress' victory in May 2023 Assembly elections, Siddaramaiah secured the CM position while Shivakumar accepted the deputy chief minister role, following intense competition between them.Although reports indicated a ""rotational chief minister"" arrangement where Shivakumar would take over after two-and-a-half years, the party has not officially confirmed this agreement.Shivaganga requested the high command to control cooperation minister K N Rajanna's public criticism of Shivakumar. ""He is causing embarrassment to the party and the government. I urge the high command to take action against Rajanna,"" he remarked.Rajanna, aligned with Siddaramaiah's faction, maintains that the current CM will complete the full five-year term.","Congress MLA Basavaraju V Shivaganga claims D K Shivakumar will ascend to the position of chief minister by December.

Private medical colleges are saving crores of rupees by either not paying stipends to MBBS interns and resident doctors or paying them a fraction of what government medical colleges pay. According to the National Medical Commission (NMC), the data on stipend payment submitted by colleges showed that 60 (33 govt colleges and 27 private ones) were not paying MBBS interns any stipend.Most private colleges have not even submitted the information on how much stipend is being paid. After initially threatening to take action, in the face of colleges not even submitting data sought from them, the apex regulator, the NMC, has passed the buck to state authorities.Thousands of MBBS students doing clinical duties during the final year internship are being paid less than the national floor minimum wage of Rs 5,300 per month according to the data submitted to Supreme Court by NMC. Data from 20 private colleges shows that they pay Rs 5,000 or less. Many colleges have admitted that they do not pay any stipend. Though this information was available to NMC in July last year, no action has been taken against any college.The NMC’s PG Medical Education Regulation 2023 stipulate that private colleges have to pay a stipend equivalent to what government colleges of the state pay resident doctors. However, the NMC (Compulsory Rotating Medical Internship) Regulations, 2021 are vague about how much MBBS interns should be paid. They state that ""all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate authority applicable to the institution/University or State"". Taking advantage of this, many private colleges pay MBBS interns a pittance.“I had alerted the health ministry to the vague wording in the clause regarding stipend for MBBS interns in 2022, when the draft was put up for comments from the public, and later raised objections when the suggestion was not incorporated. I had requested them to amend the clause to make it mandatory for all colleges to pay stipend at par with government medical colleges of the particular state. Neither the health ministry nor the NMC has done anything about it,” said Dr KV Babu, an RTI activist who has been pursuing the issue over five years.The stipend paid by some private colleges is as low as Rs 2,000 per month though they take several lakhs as fees per year. For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, government colleges pay MBBS interns Rs 22,500 per month. However, many private colleges are paying just Rs 2,000-5,000 as stipend per month. The tuition fee alone for the MBBS course in these private colleges is Rs 65 lakh for management quota students and over Rs 1.2 crore for NRI quota students. Most of these colleges with about 150 seats each would have had to spend roughly Rs 4 crore per year if they paid stipend equal to what government colleges are paying. By paying the interns a pittance, a college could save over Rs 2 crore or more each year, even as they collect around Rs 50 crore just from tuition fees.Similarly, in Karnataka, MBBS interns in state government colleges are paid a stipend of Rs 30,000 per month. But many private colleges are paying just Rs 10,000-12,000, while their annual tuition fees for management and NRI seats could be as much as Rs 25 lakh to Rs 45 lakh per year. In Pondicherry, while government colleges pay Rs 20,000 as stipend, a deemed university medical college with 250 seats, where annual tuition fees are Rs 25 lakh, pays just Rs 5,000. The college earns over 1.2 crore from each MBBS student, but spends less than one lakh rupees on stipend for each student.There is wide variation even in the stipend paid in government colleges from about Rs 35,000 in Assam to just Rs 12,000 in Uttar Pradesh. This is despite a long-standing demand of MBBS students for the amount to be centrally fixed and made mandatory for all colleges whether government or private. NMC was not even acting on the issue of non-payment of stipend till the Supreme Court categorically stated that paying stipend was mandatory. The case drags on as NMC claims to be struggling to get data from medical colleges. Instead of asking colleges, which are under its direct control, the NMC has been writing innumerable letters to the directorate of medical education of various states asking them to submit the data from all colleges on payment of stipend.NA- not applicable since the state may not have a private college, or a govt college in the case of SikkimNo info- the information has not been submitted by the state/college*only one college has given data and the amount is wrong since Haryana revised the stipend to Rs 17,000 in 2018 and last year it was revised again to Rs 24,310.States which had not submitted any information included Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Nagaland, and the union territories of Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The stipend in govt colleges in Rajasthan is Rs 14,000, in Jharkhand it is Rs 17,000, Rs 15,900 in Chhattisgarh and almost Rs 14,000 in Madhya Pradesh.Source: Affidavit filed by the NMC in court in July 2024","Private medical colleges are saving crores of rupees by either not paying stipends to MBBS interns and resident doctors or paying them a fraction of what government medical colleges pay.

NASHIK: Seven men allegedly stalked and harassed a Union minister's minor daughter and her friends during a visit to a village fair in Maharashtra's Jalgaon last Friday, brushing aside the constable escorting the girls when he demanded to check their mobile phones to confirm they hadn't secretly recorded videos.One of the suspects was detained Sunday after police registered an FIR against all 7 men under Pocso Act and sections 75(1) (sexual harassment), 78(2) (stalking), 79 (outraging a woman's modesty), & 189(2) (unlawful assembly) of BNS.""We are looking for the remaining suspects. They will be arrested soon,"" Muktainagar DSP Krishnakant Pingle said.The minister, who was in Gujarat on the night of the fair, visited the police station to enquire about the progress of the investigation. ""I went to the police station not in the capacity of a Union minister, but as a parent. The culprits bothered my daughter despite knowing that she is the daughter of an MP. One can only imagine what would have happened to other girls. I am pressing for strict action against culprits,"" he said.Opposition latched onto the case as a reflection of 'deteriorating law and order in state under Mahayuti government, wondering how ordinary people can feel safe if criminals were able to harass a Union minister's daughter and her friends despite the presence of a police escort.NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule urged CM Devendra Fadnavis to review law and order and assure people that they would be safe: ""Every girl who lives in the state is a daughter of Maharashtra. It is govt's duty to protect her.""Congress' Vijay Wadettiwar accused Mahayuti politicians of shielding criminals: ""They may not be aware how much daughters of ordinary people struggle to protect themselves.""CM Fadnavis said suspects belonged to a political party that he didn't name. ""Strict action will be taken against such people. They won't be spared,"" he said.","Seven men allegedly stalked and harassed a Union minister's minor daughter and her friends during a visit to a village fair in Maharashtra's Jalgaon last Friday.

DEHRADUN: There was no time to run. One moment, the workers were asleep inside their container homes, the bitter cold pressing in from all sides, the hum of the mountains steady and unbroken. Then came a roar - deep, monstrous, growing louder by the second. The earth beneath them shuddered. The walls groaned. And before anyone could move, the avalanche was there, like a sudden apparition in a horror movie.Ganesh Kumar, a road construction worker from Pithoragarh, barely had time to open his eyes before the container was ripped from its place it was pegged and sent tumbling into the snow. ""It happened so fast, we had no time to think,"" he said from his hospital bed in Jyotirmath. ""One moment, we were asleep. The next, the entire container was flung ahead, rolling over and over. It must have been 50, maybe 60 metres. We had no control. We were just... thrown... like puppets.""Then came the deafening silence. The world outside was gone, above a thick pile of snow. Inside the crumpled container, the men lay tangled, gasping for breath, bodies stiff with cold. ""Darkness, silence, and the unbearable cold wrapped around us like a shroud,"" one of them recalled. ""The snow was everywhere - pushing against us, pressing into our chests. We tried shouting, but the sound just died around us. It felt like the snow was swallowing our voices.""The hours crawled by, stretching endlessly. The cold bit deep, turning their limbs numb. Some of them tried clawing at the walls, but there was no way out. The air felt thinner. Some stopped talking. ""It felt like we were already gone,"" one survivor said.Then, a noise - faint at first. Footsteps. Voices, muffled through the snow. Hope surged through their bodies like a shock. ""At first, I thought I was imagining it,"" another worker said. ""Then the sound got closer, and suddenly, the snow started shifting."" Hands broke through the ice, pulling them from the wreckage, dragging them into the open air. ""They were our saviours - farishtey (angels),"" another survivor said, his voice still trembling at the memory of the Army and ITBP personnel cutting through the snow to reach them.

In an apparent attack on a particular community, Dhankhar added that there was an attempt of ""orchestrated, financially backed misadventures aimed at effecting conversions"".Making a strong appeal for unity, the vice president cautioned against engaging ""in polarised, divisive activities"" saying, ""In this country that takes pride in its Sanatan values of inclusivity, where diversity is reflected in unity, we cannot afford to be distanced from these core values and engage in polarised, divisive activities. Time for us to fall in the groove of Sanatan Dharma, as enlightened by Shri P Parameswaran Ji.""

Demography should not be confused with majoritarianism. We cannot have a society divided into these two camps. The nation is faced with grim challenges when it comes to demography. The demography evolution must be organic, natural, soothing,"" he said.""Only then it reflects unity in diversity. However, if demographic variations are brought about in the nature of virtual earthquake, there is cause for concern. If inorganic demographic variations take place with the intent to increase demographic components with the object to secure prowess, then we have to be alarmed. This is noticeably being done. We are at a crossroads where we can neither overlook nor countenance this highly destabilising development. We have to be extremely alert. All have to converge to preserve the pristine demographic sanctity of Bharat,"" he added.Dhankhar, however, cited no evidence to prove the claim, as India is yet to conduct census to count its people. Meanwhile, the last census data contradicts VP's claims and reveals that while India’s Muslim population grew at a faster rate than the Hindu population between 1991-2001 and 2001-2011, the pace of growth declined more significantly for Muslims than for Hindus over these decades. Among all major religious communities, Hindus saw the smallest decline in population growth, whereas smaller groups like Jains and Buddhists experienced the steepest drops.Dhankhar warned that the influx of illegal migrants poses a threat to the nation and called for resolute action to prevent ""demographic dislocations.""""How can a nation suffer millions of illegal migrants? Look at their number. Look at the danger they bring to this country. I would urge that we must courageously thwart these demographic dislocations.

NEW DELHI: India's aim to emerge as a developed country by 2047 is a "" realisable ambition"", said Arvind Panagariya , chairman of the 16th Finance Commission , while also stressing that the country's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.""Certainly if we do the right things in the years to come, our prospects of getting to the Viksit Bharat ambition of the PM is very much realisable dream and realisable ambition,"" he said on Saturday in his address at the 49th Civil Accounts Day.He said the country's per-capita income, in 2023-24 dollar terms, is about $ 2,570, which is very low compared to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, United States and other European nations. ""What that means is that India has the advantage that it is feasible even with existing technology, reasonable capital accumulation and skill acquisition to push the per capita income. India because of its current low per capita income has an enormous room for catch up and that catch up gives it the opportunity to grow significantly faster,"" said Panagariya.The Columbia University professor said India has gone on to gradually improve its governance system and a lot of economic reforms that had to be done have been done. He said more reforms need to be done and those will happen and this will enable India to sustain high growth rates.""Today, our per capita income in dollars is about $ 2,500. To get to $ 14,000 in 24 years or by 2047-48, what growth rate do I need for per capita income?.. my per capita income from 2023-24 onward has to grow annually at 7.3%,"" he said, adding that the $14,000 was the threshold set by the World Bank for defining developed countries.Panagariya, who has served as the first chairman of govt think tank Niti Aayog, cited United Nations data which has estimated that population in the country would grow 0.6% by 2050. He said that this would mean that to achieve a 7.3% growth in per capita income, India's GDP will have to grow at 7.9% during the next 24 years.""Our growth rate (in real dollar terms) for the last 21 years was at 7.8%... To get from 7.8% (GDP growth) to 7.9% is entirely feasible. Our prospect of Viksit Bharat is a realisable ambition,"" he said.","India's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.

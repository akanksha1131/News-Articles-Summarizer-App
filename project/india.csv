SRIHARIKOTA: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday successfully launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission that lasted 108minutes, marking the space agency’s first mission of 2026. The flight comes months after a rare setback, when PSLV-C61, launched on May 18, 2025, failed to place the EOS-09 earth observation satellite into orbit due to a third-stage anomaly. The successful PSLV-C62 mission restored momentum to Isro’s workhorse launch vehicle.The 44.4-metre-tall Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C62) lifted off from the First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, in a commercial mission for NewSpace India Limited (NSIL). The launch marked the 64th flight of PSLV and the fifth mission of the PSLV-DL variant, with all four stages performing nominally, Isro said.Following lift-off, EOS-N1 and 14 co-passenger satellites were successfully injected into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 505 km and an inclination of 97.5 degrees. After satellite deployment, the PS4 stage was re-started and de-orbited, followed by the separation of the Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID) re-entry capsule, which was placed on a controlled re-entry trajectory.The mission carried a diverse suite of technology demonstration satellites from India and overseas, covering applications such as AI processing in orbit, store-and-forward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, and agricultural data collection.The primary payload, EOS-N1 (Anvesha), is a hyperspectral earth observation satellite designed for advanced surveillance and strategic monitoring.Among the notable secondary payloads was AayulSAT, developed by Bengaluru-based startup OrbitAID Aerospace, which serves as India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling demonstrator. The mission aims to test technologies for propellant transfer and satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, a capability seen as critical for extending satellite lifetimes and enabling sustainable space operations.Another key payload, the KID re-entry capsule, a European technology demonstrator developed with a Spanish startup, separated from the PSLV’s fourth stage and was designed to splash down in the South Pacific Ocean, validating controlled atmospheric re-entry technologies.The flight also included a mix of CubeSats and small satellites from universities and startups, including missions from Dhruva Space (CGUSAT), and international partners, supporting research and commercial applications in communication, IoT and Earth observation.The successful PSLV-C62 mission follows Isro’s detailed review of the PSLV-C61 failure, one of only a handful of setbacks in PSLV’s three-decade operational history. Isro had constituted a failure analysis committee after the May 2025 mission and implemented corrective measures before returning the launcher to flight.","The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday successfully launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory.

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid’s 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro’s PSLV-C62 on Monday, it will be carrying more than a technology demonstration. If the mission succeeds as planned, India will take one step forward towards becoming only the second country in the world to have demonstrated on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China.China is believed to have carried out an on-orbit refuelling demonstration last year, though details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. US firm Astroscale is also developing a refuelling technology, but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won’t exactly demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid’s first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions.OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R, in an exclusive interview with TOI, said the first refuelling operation is expected to take place within four hours of launch, followed by multiple refuelling cycles over the course of the mission.“These transfers will be carried out under varying thermal conditions, pressure levels and eclipse phases to build a detailed operational handbook for future missions,” he said.The company has spent several years testing the technology on the ground and in zero-gravity environments before committing to an orbital demonstration. OrbitAid conducted high-pressure and low-pressure fluid transfer tests using propellants of different viscosities, followed by zero-gravity experiments in the US that successfully demonstrated bubble-free fuel transfer, a critical requirement for safe refuelling in space.Beyond fuel transfer, the mission also validates OrbitAid’s proprietary docking and refuelling interface, developed to support future in-orbit servicing missions. Sakthikumar said: “...The interface aligns with emerging international standards and has been developed in consultation with CONFERS, an industry-led initiative focused on best practices for rendezvous and proximity operations, on-orbit satellite servicing, and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing. ”If Ayulsat performs as expected, OrbitAid plans to follow it up with a chaser satellite within six to eight months. “That mission would demonstrate close-proximity operations and, later, docking and fuel transfer between two spacecraft, a key step towards extending the operational life of satellites already in orbit,” Sakthikumar said.The implications are significant. On-orbit refuelling could reduce the need for costly satellite replacements, allow spacecraft stranded in sub-optimal orbits to be recovered, and enable longer missions for strategic and commercial satellites alike.For India, the mission also marks a shift in how advanced space capabilities are being developed. Ayulsat is being flown by a private startup, highlighting the growing role of Indian industry in frontier space technologies.As Sakthikumar put it, replacement satellites are expensive, but servicing an existing one can dramatically change mission economics. Jan 12 will determine whether India can now claim a place in one of the most exclusive clubs in spaceflight.","China is believed to have carried out an on-orbit refuelling demonstration last year.

'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray , who recently forged an alliance with his estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray ahead of the BMC polls, warned Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.Thackeray said he would ""kick"" people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they ""try to impose Hindi"".""People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don't hate the language... But if you try to impose it, I'll kick you. They're coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share... If land and language are gone, you will be finished,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Calling the BMC polls the ""last election for the Marathi man"", Thackeray said: ""If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.""""Today, this crisis has arrived at your doorstep... This is the last election for the Marathi man... If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished.

The BLA (Booth Level Agents) appointed at 6 AM should be ready on election day... Be alert, be vigilant, don't be careless...If anyone comes to vote again, throw them out,"" Thackeray said.



Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray on Sunday mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva” at a rally held ahead of the civic polls, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray, who heads the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra.Appealing to the core Marathi votebank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.“This is the last election for Marathi manoos. If he makes a mistake now, the battle (for Mumbai) will be lost forever,” he said.Speaking after Raj, the Sena (UBT) chief questioned whether the BJP wanted to rename Mumbai as “Bombay”, referring to remarks made by Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai.Accusing the BJP of practising divisive politics ahead of elections, Uddhav said, “BJP's Hindutva and nationalism are fake.”“The BJP has become a party which says corruption first, instead of nation first,” he added.","MNS chief Raj Thackeray warns Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.

‘Hijab-Clad PM’ Row: Owaisi’s ‘Tubelight’ Jab At Himanta Sarma Over ‘Only Hindu PM’ Remarks

'Hindutva a political tract'

'Cherishing Hinduism is Hindutva'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar stirred another row on Sunday after he said Hindutva is ""Hinduism in paranoia,"" which drew a strong response from the ruling BJP During the debate on ""Hinduism Needs Protection From Hindutva"", hosted by the Calcutta Debating Circle, Aiyar said Hindutva is a BJP leader ""slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church"".Aiyar also said Hindutva asks ""80 per cent of Hindus to quiver in front of 14 per cent of Muslims"".""Hindutva is Hinduism in paranoia. It asks 80% Hindus to quiver in front of 14% Muslims. Hindutva is a BJP leader slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church. Hindutva raids shopping malls to tear down Christmas decorations,"" said Aiyar during the debate.He also quoted VD Savarkar, saying that the Hindutva ideologue saw Buddhism as an existential threat to all Hindus.""He described it as the ultimate negation of Hindutva, bearing the opiate of universalism and nonviolence. He said it was disastrous to national virility and even the existence of the Hindu race,"" said Aiyar, referring to Savarkar.Drawing a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Aiyar said Hinduism is ""a great spiritual religion, while Hindutva is a political tract."" He also said that Hinduism faced trials and tribulations yet managed to survive and flourish without any need for Hindutva's protection.""Hinduism is a great spiritual religion. Hindutva is a political tract. Hindutva came only in 1923; for thousands of years before Hindutva, Hinduism faced trial and tribulation and yet survived, flourished, with no need of Hindutva protection... There is no way Gandhi's and Swami Vivekananda's Hinduism can be protected or promoted by Savarkar's Hindutva,"" Aiyar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Speaking at the same event, Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Hindutva represents 'Hindu tattva,' which forms the core essence of Hinduism.He further argued that Hinduism is unique among religions in granting its followers the authority to debate, even on its sacred texts.""... Which culture gives you the authority to debate even on religious texts. It is only Hindu... I would like to ask why the term Hinduism? Why is 'ism' associated with all the religions which originated in India? Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. You have never heard of Islamism and Christianism... The 'ism' world is being associated just to demean, and what Hindutva is, 'Hindu tattva'. The basic immunity of Hinduism is Hindu tattva. .. Another thing I would like to say, when you cherish Hinduism, it is called Hindutva,"" the Trivedi said.Lashing out at Aiyar's remark, the BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: ""Yet again Congress attempts to create a divide between Hindus.""They want 1 Hindu to Stand up against the other Hindu.

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, people in the know told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant's biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades. When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Those aware of developments said Cognizant's EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. ""CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability. These deals now typically span seven to ten years. ""","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.",Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

'Oye Chinese '



Anjel Chakma

'I am an Indian'



'Do you even get Maggi there?'



Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs. A colleague asked Sushma, who hails from Assam

Fear during Covid



'My only mistake is that I look like this'



Nido Taniam

India has seen such cases for years



A legal vaccum



""You people eat dogs, cats, pigs and all your animals, right?"" This was a question Riba says she was repeatedly asked because she hails from the Northeast.Working at a high-profile firm did little to shield her from stereotypes. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances routinely questioned her food habits, appearance and even language.What hurt most, she says, was that many people did not see anything wrong with asking such questions.""It definitely triggered me being questioned every day about what I eat, how I look and where I belong,"" she recalls.That casual prejudice, civil rights activists say often escalates into something far more dangerous.These day-to-day casual slurs, which come as no surprise in the lives of people from the Northeast, reveal that even India’s so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive.For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned and belonging is never fully accepted.On December 9, what began as a routine visit to a local market in Dehradun ended in fatal violence.Twenty-four-year-old Anjel Chakma from Tripura lost his life.Anjel and his younger brother Michael had been planning a Chandrashila trek scheduled for December 22 and had even ordered new trekking shoes for the trip.The shoes arrived a day after the attack. They were never unpacked.According to Michael and other family members, the brothers were subjected to racial slurs — "" Chinki ,"" ""Chinese"" and ""Momo"" during a grocery run in the Selaqui area. One of the men allegedly sneered, ""Oye Chinese, have you come to buy pork?""Anjel objected to the abuse and asserted their identity. ""We are not Chinese… We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" he allegedly said.What followed, according to family and friends, was brutal violence.""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend who stayed at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and remains in serious condition.""Dehradun senior superintendent of police Ajai Singh said the comments appeared to target the brothers’ appearance. Police said Anjel was struck with a knife and a metal kada, leaving him critically injured.The case drew national attention after Anjel’s father said his son was attacked despite clearly asserting that he was Indian.Similar incidents occur with alarming regularity.Arjun Rimo from Arunachal Pradesh recalls a recent incident in Delhi that left him shaken. ""On January 8, 2026, in Karol Bagh, New Delhi, while buying meat at a shop, I was mistreated,"" he told TOI.""As I chose to leave, I was subjected to racial abuse and called ‘Chinese’. I immediately objected and stated that I am an Indian.""He said a person associated with the shop attacked him first.""I reacted only in self-defence. I punched him, during which he sustained a facial injury. Soon after, two more individuals joined him, and the three of them assaulted me together.""As a crowd of 30 to 35 people gathered, Rimo said he became overwhelmed.""I could no longer protect myself. Fearing serious harm, I sought police assistance,"" he said, adding that he personally witnessed the accused being taken into police custody.""This episode,"" he said, ""highlights a broader, long-standing challenge faced by citizens from India’s North-Eastern region,"" who frequently encounter bias and unequal treatment when living or travelling outside their home states, particularly in metropolitan cities.For many, stepping outside the Northeast means confronting suspicion, stereotyping and casual prejudice — not as isolated incidents, but as an everyday reality.For Sushma Pegu, who works at a high-profile firm in Bengaluru, discrimination followed her into corporate spaces.She recalls being bullied, subjected to racial slurs, and questioned relentlessly about her food habits.""A colleague literally asked me, ‘Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs.’""""I took a stand,"" she said, adding that the colleague was eventually terminated.But the questioning, she said, often begins the moment she steps into a cab, with drivers routinely asking, ""Which country are you from?"" prompted solely by her appearance.Roshni recalls how racial prejudice intensified during the Covid-19 outbreak.""During my time at Lakshmibai College,"" she said, ""a group of students passed a remark about one of my friends, saying, ‘Mujhe toh isko dekh kar dar lag raha hai’ (I feel scared just looking at her).""She said the comment, though made casually, carried a deep sense of exclusion and fear.""I felt shocked, angry and deeply uncomfortable,"" she said.""It created a lasting sense of humiliation and helplessness.""In October 2025, a 27-year-old flight attendant from Meghalaya alleged that she was racially abused twice within an hour in Delhi; first in north Delhi's Kamla Nagar and later on the metro.Her Instagram video went viral after Union minister Kiren Rijiju reposted it.In the video, the woman said a group of men sitting on a scooter mocked her using racial slurs and laughed. Shaken, she walked into a nearby Tibetan eatery but found herself unable to eat.""I did not feel like eating anything. My brain could not process what had just happened,"" she said.""It breaks my heart,"" she added. ""My only mistake is that I am born in India and I look like this and I don’t look like what people expect Indians to look like.""Having travelled to several countries, she said she had never been made to feel unwelcome abroad.""But today, in my own country, my fellow Indians made me feel like I did not belong.""Addressing the alleged perpetrators, she said, ""You didn’t just insult me. You insulted every person who has ever felt ‘othered’ in their own country. India is diverse our faces, our languages and our cultures are all valid. You don’t get to decide who belongs and who doesn’t.""Such incidents are far from isolated.In November 2023, students from the Northeast reported racial and misogynistic abuse near Delhi University’s North Campus. In 2016, two youths from Mizoram were beaten in Bengaluru for not speaking the local language.One of the most chilling cases remains the killing of Nido Taniam in January 2014. The 19-year-old student from Arunachal Pradesh was beaten to death in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar after shopkeepers mocked his hairstyle.A police investigation report detailed how Nido and his friends had gone to meet another friend when a shopkeeper made derogatory remarks about his appearance.An altercation followed, during which Nido smashed a glass pane. The shopkeeper and his associates allegedly assaulted him while making racist remarks about his caste, race and appearance.Although the immediate dispute was settled after Nido paid compensation, he was later assaulted again by the group and died in his sleep at a friend’s residence.The incident sparked widespread outrage among people from the Northeast living in Delhi, with allegations that the police failed to protect him despite repeated pleas.India is a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, yet does not have a specific law addressing racial discrimination.Following Nido Taniam’s death, the MP Bezbaruah Committee recommended criminalising racial slurs such as ""chinki"" and ""Chinese"", proposing jail terms of up to five years.While some administrative steps were taken, the proposed amendments to the IPC remain pending.In 2016, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to monitor the implementation of the committee’s recommendations. Activists, however, say enforcement remains inconsistent, with racial abuse often dismissed as a social issue rather than treated as a criminal offence.These incidents show how deeply racial prejudice is woven into everyday life. While stronger laws are necessary, activists argue they are not sufficient on their own.The fight, they say, must begin in schools, through education on diversity, history and discrimination. It must be carried forward by police, institutions, political parties and society at large.Multiculturalism cannot remain a slogan. It must be practised.","Civil rights activists say casual prejudice often escalates into something far more dangerous. Even India's so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive. For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned and belonging is never fully accepted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126465493,imgsize-68780,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘Attack On My Life’: Suvendu Adhikari Targets Mamata Banerjee, Levels Serious Allegation

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday dismissed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's contention that her dramatic intervention in the ED raids at I-PAC premises in Kolkata was in her capacity as TMC president, and suggested that her compulsion to remove evidence linking "" coal scam "" proceeds to her party might be the real reason.BJP Lok Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari's convoy and said no FIR was registered despite BJP's complaint. He said BJP functionaries have often been at the receiving end of such violence, often in the presence of state police.Slamming Banerjee, he said she was seen clutching a specific green file, which was removed during ED raids, and shrugged off her assertion that the central agency was looking to steal her party's poll strategy, including the list of its probable candidates. ""Why did a CM have to personally retrieve a file during a raid? What specific incriminating evidence was in that green file? Names of coal scam beneficiaries, the TMC leaders involved, the route of the hawala money, or the list of officers who facilitated the smuggling,"" he asked.Prasad alleged that her ""desperation"" might be linked to the tunnelling of hawala money to fund her party's campaign in the last Goa assembly polls.",BJP Lok Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari's convoy.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

PM Modi Offers Prayers At Somnath Temple, Witnesses Grand Drone Show & Fireworks At Swabhiman Parv

PM Modi: In face of great global uncertainty, India stands out

AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: India must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country, PM Modi said Sunday while projecting Gujarat's ancient Somnath temple as a model of resistance to what he termed ""religious terrorism"".PM Modi carried the broader theme of resilience to the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot, where he assured investors that the country offers ""extraordinary certainty"" amid global turbulence.At a rally in Somnath, where the shrine was rebuilt over centuries of pillage by invaders, the PM accused unnamed historians and politicians of obfuscating what had happened. ""Those with a mindset of religious extremism tried to disguise religious terrorism as merely motivated by wealth. They even wrote books to conceal the cruel history of hatred, atrocities and terrorism,"" he said.PM Modi said the temple’s history was inseparable from the valour of protectors like Raval Kanhardev, Veer Hamirji and Vegda Bhil, who never received due recognition for thwarting a succession of attempts to destroy the shrine. “There are no parallels anywhere in the world to Somnath’s retaliation against religious terrorism.”Harking back to how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel faced hurdles after pledging to renovate Somnath and objections by some quarters to former President Rajendra Prasad’s 1951 temple visit, the PM said the “same forces” continue to pursue that agenda. “Only their methods have changed. In place of swords, they are now using vile means against India,” he said. In Rajkot, 200km from Somnath, PM Modi cited recent assessments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rating agencies S&P and Fitch as evidence of rising global confidence in India’s economy.S&P upgraded India’s rating outlook after 18 years, he said, while IMF has described the country as the engine of global growth. “In the face of great global uncertainty, India today stands out,” PM Modi said. “There’s political stability, continuity in policy, and the rapid expansion of the neo-middle class with rising purchasing power.” The PM pointed to sectoral shifts, saying that from importing nine of every 10 mobile phones in 2014, India now ranks second globally in manufacturing handsets.The country has also become the largest consumer of mobile data and hosts the world’s largest real-time digital payments platform through UPI, he said. It has the third-largest startup ecosystem, ranks among the top three in solar power generation and has emerged as the third-largest aviation market, PM Modi said. “This Reform Express won’t halt,” PM Modi said before reprising his Red Fort punchline, “Yehi samay hai, sahi samay hai (This time is the right time). ”","PM Modi: India must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country.

A court sent him to jail after Kerala police crime branch investigators said he could intimidate complainants, influence witnesses and destroy evidence.Congress on Sunday distanced itself from the MLA, with party senior K Muraleedharan saying Mamkootathil had been removed after the allegations surfaced. ""After that, he is no longer our responsibility, and the party is not answerable for anything,"" he said.The latest case stems from an alleged assault on a 31-year-old woman at a hotel in Thiruvalla on April 8, 2024. The arrest followed what police sources described as urgent directions from Vijayan after the complainant sent a voice message on Jan 8 expressing fear for her family. Police dropped plans to wait for her return from abroad for a magistrate's statement. The state police chief approved the operation around 8pm Saturday, and officers moved quickly to pre-empt a bail bid.Crime branch units in Kollam and Pathanamthitta registered a case and said Mamkootathil refused to unlock his phone. Police seized the device, conducted a potency exam, and collected blood for DNA testing. Officers arrested him at 12.30 am at a hotel in Palakkad, took him to Pathanamthitta's armed reserve camp for questioning, recorded the arrest at 7.30 am, and produced him in court.","Kerala Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, 36, was arrested Sunday and remanded in judicial custody in a third rape case.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union home minister Amit Shah demanded Sunday Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan 's resignation and warned of statewide BJP protests unless a ""neutral probe"" is ordered into an alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala hill shrine.""It is time for CM Pinarayi Vijayan to go, as LDF could not safeguard Sabarimala and also could not bring development to the state,"" Shah said, addressing party workers at a felicitation function for BJP winners in local body polls in Thiruvananthapuram. He said the FIR in the case was ""designed to protect the real culprits"" and questioned how justice could be ensured ""when ministers are involved"".The alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district has triggered political accusations, with BJP claiming a cover-up and seeking a probe independent of Kerala police. Left Democratic Front (LDF) govt denies wrongdoing. According to the state-appointed SIT, gold embedded in sacred structures was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted in 2015 through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers.Setting the tone for BJP's campaign ahead of the 2026 Kerala assembly elections, Shah predicted a breakthrough. ""The lotus will bloom in the state as BJP will assume office in 2026,"" he said.""Our aim is to develop Kerala, to protect the state from anti-nationals, and safeguard the centuries-old devotion of the people.""He accused both LDF and Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) of ""match-fixing"" that led to stagnation. ""Communist parties are wiped out from the entire world and Congress has been wiped out in India. The path to development of Kerala is with NDA under the leadership of Modi-ji,"" Shah said, linking Kerala's future to PM Narendra Modi's goal of a developed India by 2047.Citing BJP's growth, Shah said vote share rose from 16% in 2019 to 20% in 2024 and claimed the jump to ""30% to 40%"" would come in 2026. ""I am confident that BJP state president Rajiv Chandrasekhar can end this musical chair by LDF and UDF,"" he said.Drawing parallels with other states, Shah listed BJP's rise from marginal presence to govt in Assam, Manipur, Tripura, and UP. ""Today we have a mayor in Thiruvananthapuram, and tomorrow we will see a CM,"" he said.","Union home minister Amit Shah demands resignation of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan.

LUCKNOW: A central GST inspector posted in New Delhi has been named an accused in a Rs 100-crore tax evasion racket uncovered by UP's Special Task Force (STF), a case that investigators said exposed deep collusion between tax officials and a network of shell firms.Inspector Mohit Agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes, STF officials said Sunday. Teams have been deployed to trace and arrest him.The case registered at Kavi Nagar police station in Ghaziabad district centres on large-scale GST fraud through bogus firms, fake e-way bills and forged invoices. On Friday, STF arrested four accused - New Delhi-based scrap dealer Hardeep Singh alias Prince, along with Jitendra Jha, Punit Agrawal and Shivam Singh. Investigators alleged the syndicate floated multiple shell companies and generated fake e-way bills to illegally claim input tax credit, causing estimated loss of nearly Rs 100 crore to govt.During the probe, evidence emerged showing inspector Agrawal allegedly actively aided the operation. STF officers said he accepted bribes to restore suspended firms, shield fake entities from scrutiny and manipulate records.One such firm, Adon Automobile, allegedly linked to Punit Agrawal, was suspended around three months ago but restored after inspector Agrawal's intervention. Investigators clai-med he accepted Rs 40,000 for the favour. STF also pointed to the role of Alok, a Haryana-based facilitator who allegedly supp-lied fake firms to Hardeep Singh for a lump-sum commission.WhatsApp chats recovered from Punit's phone allegedly detail discussions on payments and record manipulation, officers said, and indicated more arrests were likely as investigators widen the net across UP and neighbouring states.","Inspector Mohit Agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

NAGPUR: Maharashtra govt's decision to credit Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana instalments for Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 to beneficiaries' accounts on Jan 14, the eve of municipal polls, has become a flashpoint between BJP-led Mahayuti and opposition Congress.Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) moved state election commission (SEC), objecting to govt's decision to credit two months' instalments, totalling Rs 3,000, barely 24 hours before the civic polls. It termed the release plan a ""collective govt bribe"", accusing it of violating model code of conduct to influence over 1 crore women voters. The party urged the commission to direct govt to release the funds only after polling concludes.Revenue minister and Nagpur district guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Sunday dismissed Congress's objections as political opportunism, asserting that women beneficiaries could not be held hostage to election schedules as the Ladki Bahin scheme predated the announcement of civic polls and had ""nothing to do with municipal elections"".""This is an ongoing welfare programme of the state govt. For polls in 29 civic bodies, women across the entire state cannot be deprived of their rightful benefits,"" he told a press conference, adding any attempt to stall payments would amount to discrimination against women.Bawankule accused Congress of hypocrisy and obstructionism. ""When this govt launched the scheme, Congress tried everything to stop it. Former MPCC president Nana Patole attempted to derail the scheme by encouraging a petition in the high court,"" he alleged.""With nearly 2.5 crore beneficiaries, stopping payments because of elections would cause real hardship. Welfare cannot be switched on and off for political convenience,"" Bawankule said.Nagpur BJP city president Dayashankar Tiwari called it an exposure of Congress's ""anti-women mindset"".","Mahar Maharashtra govt's decision to credit Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana instalments for Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 to beneficiaries' accounts on Jan 14 has become a flashpoint between BJP-led Mahayuti and opposition Congress.

Since 1967, both the DMK and the AIADMK have formed governments on their own despite contesting elections as part of alliances.The only exception dates back to the first assembly (1952–57) in the then Madras state, when the Congress, lacking an absolute majority, accommodated non-Congress leaders in its Cabinet.In 2006, the DMK ran a full five-year government despite falling short of a majority, relying on outside support from allies, including the Congress, but without sharing ministerial power.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

Even within TN Cong, some do not press for a coalition government

With inputs from agencies

DINDIGUL: Tamil Nadu's governing DMK has rejected demands from a section of ally Congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls, with minister I Periyasamy asserting on Sunday that there ""would be no coalition govt here"".Speaking in Dindigul, Periyasamy pointed out that Tamil Nadu had always been governed by a single party and the tradition would continue even after the ensuing elections. This is the first time DMK has formally rejected the demand, which has gained traction over the past several months.Periyasamy, DMK deputy general secretary and rural administration minister, admitted that Congress was within its rights to put forth the demand but made it clear that CM M K Stalin wasn't inclined to accept. ""Tamil Nadu has always had single-party rule. The CM is firm on this,"" Periyasamy said.The remarks come amid the chorus for powersharing growing louder. Sections of Congress, including MP Manickam Tagore, have stressed that no party can win elections on their own in Tamil Nadu and the time has come for a discussion on coalition govts. Tagore had said the debate was no longer just about winning power but also about sharing it.Although DMK has credited its alliance for its successive electoral victories, the party has consistently resisted power-sharing demands. DMK’s other allies, too, are divided on the issue — unlike Congress, VCK, Left parties and MDMK do not insist on coalition govts. Even within Congress, there are voices, including that of state chief K Selvaperunthagai, who do not press for the demand. However, AICC incharge for Tamil Nadu, Girish Chodankar, has pushed for coalitions, suggesting political parties should call themselves “NGOs” if they declare they don’t want power.","DMK rejects demands from a section of ally Congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls.

Different words. The same grim picture.



The never-ending list of restrictions



‘Staying within limits’ does not protect women



Shifting the focus: From victims to perpetrators



The way forward

“Only when Sitaji crossed the Lakshman rekha was she kidnapped by Ravan ,” BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said in 2013, invoking the mythological boundary as a warning for women to stay “within limits” to avoid being abducted by “Ravanas”.The remark was widely criticised at the time. Yet its underlying message was unmistakable: when violence occurs, the woman must have stepped out of line.Statements like these reflect a long-standing pattern in which responsibility quietly shifts from the perpetrator to the victim — from the act of violence itself to a woman’s choices, movements and behaviour.This is not about one leader, one party or one careless remark. It is about a mindset — deeply embedded across politics, courts, families and everyday conversations — that continues to search for causes of sexual violence in women’s conduct rather than men’s decisions.Back in 2013, Vijayvargiya’s comments were condemned. More than a decade later, the language may have softened, the metaphors may have changed — the thinking has not.Fast forward to 2025, and similar blame once again dominated headlines.Last October, a second-year medical student was gang-raped near her institute campus in Durgapur after stepping out for dinner with a male classmate. In response, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that “girls should not be allowed to come outside at night-time.”The remark drew political backlash. BJP MP Bansuri Swaraj accused Banerjee of justifying rape and called the comment reflective of a “regressive mindset.” Banerjee later said her words had been distorted and taken out of context.But once again, the focus had shifted — away from the crime, toward policing women’s behaviour.Victim-blaming is not confined to political rhetoric. At times, it seeps into judicial language as well.In March 2025, the Allahabad High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping a woman he met at a bar in Delhi’s Hauz Khas, observing that the “victim herself invited trouble.”The comment drew sharp scrutiny from the Supreme Court. Justices B.R. Gavai and Augustine George Masih cautioned judges against such observations, stating that while bail may be granted, courts must be careful in how they speak about survivors of sexual violence.In 2021, Karnataka MLA KR Ramesh Kumar sparked nationwide condemnation after saying in the assembly that “when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it” — a statement that drew laughter from some members.The remark was later withdrawn, with Kumar apologising and claiming he had no intention of insulting women or the House. But the damage lay not just in the words, but in the ease with which they were spoken and received.Time and again, public discourse around sexual violence drifts away from the crime itself and toward moral instruction for women — where they should go, how they should dress, and when they should be visible.From warnings like “don’t cross limits” to strict rules such as “don’t step out at night,” the underlying message remains the same — women must continue to change and modify their lives to prevent crimes they did not commit. For many, these limitations are not a matter of choice but an evil necessity, adopted as precautions to stay safe and protected.For many families, these restrictions are framed as protection, not control. The mother of a 19-year-old told TOI that while she had no issue with her daughter’s clothes or independence, that freedom felt conditional.“When we’re around, we feel she is safe,” she said. “But when she’s alone, it’s different.”Another woman from Noida described the same conflict. “I want my daughter to live freely,” she said. “But with crime rates so high, fear always wins.”However, no matter what measures women take, it is never really safe.A 21-year-old college student told TOI about a frightening experience returning late to her college hostel. “A car with 4-5 men slowed down near me, and one called out, ‘ee aaja’ (hey, come here). My instincts said to run, but I felt numb and just kept walking. They eventually drove off, but those few seconds traumatised me,” she said, adding that she was dressed modest.A Delhi-based corporate worker told TOI, “Though my parents are supportive and trust me, they still set what they think are ‘reasonable’ restrictions for my safety—like a curfew and discomfort with certain clothes since I use public transport here. Given the city’s crime rates, they believe dressing modestly and getting home before dark helps avoid unwanted attention. It’s as if it’s normal for women not to go out at night—that’s the reality. ”This is the quiet burden women grow up carrying — not just fear of violence, but fear of blame.The idea that safety lies in restraint collapses under data.According to NCRB figures from 2023, 97.5% of reported rape cases were committed by someone known to the victim. Homes, families and relationships — not streets alone — are often where violence occurs.Supreme Court advocate Barnali Basak told TOI that social stigma prevents many survivors, particularly from privileged backgrounds, from reporting sexual violence.“The fear of social judgment outweighs the crime itself,” she said.Children remain among the most vulnerable. Experts warn that abuse within families often goes unreported for years, silenced by fear, dependency and shame.Akansha Rastogi, a developmental psychologist at Children First, told TOI, “When a child reports abuse but is ignored or silenced, the psychological impact can be severe. Their boundaries are violated, and they lose their sense of control. This can lead to long-term mental health issues, insecurities, and difficulties trusting others.” She further added that trauma is often stored in the body, as it keeps“the score, which can affect future relationships and intimacy in unpredictable ways. ”Dr Medha, assistant professor of psychology at Patna Women’s College, explained that victim-blaming functions as a psychological defence.She explained, “Victim-blaming helps people feel safe. It reduces fear, protects social beliefs, and maintains existing power structures.”“People want to believe the world is fair,” she said. “Blaming the victim creates distance — ‘this won’t happen to me.’”But the reality, experts stress, is simple: rape is not caused by clothing, behaviour or timing. It is an act rooted in power, entitlement and control. “Rape is not caused by a woman’s clothes, behavior, or personality…rape occurs even when women are: fully covered, elderly, children, disabled, or in safe places. These cases clearly show that clothing or “attractiveness” is not the cause,” Dr Medha explained.Women are raped at home, by relatives, by husbands, in daylight, while fully covered, and even as children. If clothing or visibility were causes, these patterns would not exist.The conclusion is unambiguous: rape happens because some men choose to violate.Blaming women does nothing to prevent it. Holding perpetrators accountable does.Ending victim-blaming requires a fundamental shift — from asking “Why was she there?” to asking “Why did he do this?”Blaming the victim can create a false sense of security: “If I don’t do that, it won’t happen to me.” But this is an illusion. Sexual violence occurs not because someone was visible, friendly, or outside—it happens because someone felt entitled, lacked empathy, or chose to misuse power.According to trauma psychologist Judith Herman, healing begins when survivors are believed, not interrogated.“Blaming women is fear-based,” she writes. “Believing women is justice-based.”A society that stops blaming survivors is not becoming weaker. It is becoming more honest.","A long-standing pattern in which responsibility quietly shifts from the perpetrator to the victim.

Rare visits do not amount to shared conjugal life: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rare-visits-do-not-amount-to-shared-conjugal-life-hc/articleshow/126472115.cms,".

KOLKATA: ""Once in a blue moon"" visits do not amount to a shared conjugal life, Calcutta high court said on Jan 8 while granting divorce to a couple living apart since 2015, ruling that a marriage stripped of empathy cannot be sustained. The court dissolved the marriage but allowed the father monthly access to his son.A division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that irretrievable breakdown of marriage qualifies as cruelty under Special Marriage Act, extending a 2023 Supreme Court ruling under Hindu marriage law to cases governed by the 1954 statute.The wife, a medical professional posted in Kurseong in north Bengal's Darjeeling district, approached the HC after a lower court in 2022 refused divorce on grounds of cruelty and desertion. The couple married in 2007, lived in Howrah and had a son in 2011. Her earlier postings were in Malda and Birbhum, both in south-central Bengal, before she returned to Howrah and later moved to Kurseong.She argued they had been living separately since 2015, with only occasional visits by the husband and no marital relationship. She also complained the trial court had blocked testimony from her colleagues about alleged abuse at her workplace, even refusing video-conference evidence on grounds of ""insufficient infrastructure"".The HC disagreed, finding cruelty and desertion proved. It said the husband admitted living separately except for stray visits and failed to back claims of brief cohabitation. It also faulted rejection of video evidence on flimsy grounds.Judges pointed to contradictions in the husband's stand - opposing divorce while seeking continued access only to the child. ""When the convivial atmosphere is lost in a matrimonial relationship and all empathy dries up, nothing remains in the marriage for it to be sustained,"" the court said, declaring the marriage irretrievably broken.The husband may meet the child once a month, on the first Sunday, for two hours at a public place.","Calcutta high court grants divorce to a couple living apart since 2015.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday.

BHOPAL: A local court in Bhopal dismissed a civil suit challenging ownership of a 16.62-acre parcel of prime land once linked to the erstwhile Bhopal royal family, ruling in favour of actor Saif Ali Khan , Sharmila Tagore, Soha Ali Khan and other legal heirs of the royal family, who were respondents in the case.The dispute related to land in Nayapura area of Huzur tehsil, where three residents claimed ownership. They argued the property was gifted to their father, late Vakil Ahmed, by the last ruling Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, in 1936 as a reward for services rendered by him and his ancestors during the princely era.The plaintiffs relied on entries in old revenue records and claimed continuous possession of the land, including construction of rooms, engagement of caretakers and allotment of small portions to others for residence and upkeep.However, in its order last week, court rejected the claims on multiple grounds. It held the plaintiffs failed to conclusively prove the alleged inayat (gift). It also found that the disputed land formed part of the personal property of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi as mentioned in Bhopal merger agreement signed with govt of India in 1949.Court records showed following a family partition, 12.62 acres of the land were sold to a builder in 1998 by Pataudi and his family, preceded filing of the present suit.","The dispute related to land in Nayapura area of Huzur tehsil.

'India Will Develop Even On Autopilot', Says NSA Ajit Doval As He Credits PM Modi’s Leadership

NEW DELHI: National security adviser Ajit Doval , widely referred to as India's 'spymaster or James Bond', has revealed that he does not use a mobile-phone or internet in his day-to-day work.When asked if he used mobile or internet for routine work, the NSA replied, ""It is true that I do not use internet. I also do not use a phone, except for family matters or for speaking to people in other countries, which is necessary. I manage my work that way. There are many other means of communication as well, and some additional methods have to be arranged that people are not aware of.""He said this while addressing the inaugural session of Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026 at Bharat Mandapam here Saturday.Doval, who has been NSA since 2014, said it is important to take the right and farsighted decisions at the utmost time, particularly for the youth. However, the former IB director advised it is important to think about what ""the next two steps will be before a person takes the first step"".He said India needs to strengthen itself as ""we had a painful history of attacks and subjugation"". ""We were a very advanced civilisation.We never broke anyone's temples. We did not attack any foreigners, even when the rest of the world was weak, we did not understand the threats to our security. And, so history taught us a lesson. It is important that we remember that lesson because if the youth forget it, then it would be tragic for the country,"" the NSA said.""Revenge is not a good word, but it can be a huge force. We have to avenge our history and take this country to the point where it is great again not just in terms of border security, but economy, social development, every aspect,"" he said.The NSA spoke about the importance of decision-making in leadership and nation-building. ""One common thing between when I was young and how I am today is the ability to make decisions. Whether you realise it or not, decision-making always walks with you. Youth take small and big decisions in daily life, and as you grow, these small decisions add up to big ones,"" he said. ""Napoleon once said, 'I am not afraid of 1,000 lions led by a sheep, but I am afraid of 1,000 sheep led by a lion'. That is how important leadership is,"" he explained.Expressing confidence in India's future, Doval said, ""India will be developed. The level to which our country has been brought under PM Modi, it will soon achieve the goal of being a developed nation. The real question is - who will lead the nation towards that development? If you want to be leaders on the path of Viksit Bharat, you must start making decisions now, and those decisions should be taken with a forward-looking vision, not just for today but for the future.

Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

CHENNAI: Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK) leader TKS Elangovan blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the delay in censor certification of actor-turned-politician Vijay's 'Jana Nayagan', accusing them of pressurising the censor board.He said that Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Vijay has moved to the Madras High Court over the issue, adding that the censorship process takes only two to three days.""The BJP is delaying the release of the movie Jana Nayagan with censorship objections. Normally, the censor process is completed within 2-3 days, but they are putting pressure. Actor Vijay has gone to court against this delay,"" Elangovan told ANI.However, BJP leader Tamilisai Soundararajan slammed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin over the issue, asserting that the Congress and ruling DMK have no moral authority to criticise the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).Speaking to during Pongal celebrations, she criticised Congress' history of ""stifling freedom of expression"" during the Emergency and its past record of banning films.""Tamil Nadu CM has no moral responsibility to talk about incidents like the central sensor board because it is an independent body,"" she stated.On Friday, the Madras High Court directed the CBFC to issue a U/A 16+ certification for the film, days after the makers postponed its theatrical release,"" Soundararajan added.""The matter was postponed, and today the order was pronounced. The writ petition has been allowed by the MHC. If the movie is not screened on time, it will be a significant loss for attendees, so reimbursement is being offered. The lawyers informed that 27 scenes have been cut. If CBFC goes for an appeal, we will face them in court,"" Indra Dhanraj, joint coordinator for the state legal wing, TVK, told the media.'Jana Nayagan' producer Venkat Narayana, in a video message, stated that the matter remains ""subjudiced."" He revealed that the film was initially cleared after the makers incorporated a few cuts as suggested by the board.""Just a few days before our planned release, we were informed that the film had been referred to the revising committee based on a complaint. With the time running out and without knowing the complainant, we approached the High Court. After hearing the matter, the court directed that the certificate be issued, but the CBFC immediately challenged the decision. The order to issue the certification has been stayed,"" the producer said.Directed by H Vinoth and produced by Venkat K Narayana under KVN Productions, 'Jana Nayagan' is dubbed as Thalapathy Vijay's last film.","DMK leader TKS Elangovan blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the delay in censor certification of actor-turned-politician Vijay's 'Jana Nayagan' He said that Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Vijay has moved to the Madras High Court over the issue.

RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat Calls For Hindu Unity, Says India Will Lead World In 20–30 Years

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations. Shikha Soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in Nakti village of Tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations across govt schools in Raipur division. Namrata Verma, an assistant teacher on contract, moderated it.To the question 'What is the name of Mona's dog?', students had four options to choose from: 'Bala', 'Sheru', 'Ram' and 'No one'. Soni said the 'typo' went unnoticed while Verma said she failed to spot the incorrect option.Both maintained they had no intention of hurting religious sentiments or any community.","The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal.

Study: Aerosols making winter fog worse in north India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-aerosols-making-winter-fog-worse-in-north-india/articleshow/126471022.cms,".

DEHRADUN: Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern India, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl across the Indo-Gangetic plain. Now, new research published in Science Advances journal reveals that air pollution is not just accompanying these fog events - it is actively making them thicker, longer-lasting and harder to disperse, reports Gaurav Talwar.The peer-reviewed study, led by researchers from IIT Madras, shows that high concentrations of aerosols - tiny particles released from vehicles, industries, biomass burning and other human activities - are ""invigorating"" fog layers over parts of northern India. Using 15 years of satellite data and high-resolution weather-chemistry simulations, the researchers uncovered a clear physical mechanism linking pollution to intensified fog.They found that during polluted conditions, fog layers over the Indo-Gangetic plain grew about 15-20% thicker, often reaching heights of 400-600 m. Crucially, this thickening happens mainly at the top of the fog layer, not at the surface.The reason lies in how aerosols interact with fog droplets - more aerosols lead to more droplets, stronger cooling, increased vertical mixing and ultimately a thicker fog layer.As per the study, satellite observations revealed that fog in polluted conditions contains larger droplets near its top - a finding that may initially seem counterintuitive. In many clouds, pollution leads to smaller droplets. But in fog, where moisture is abundant and the atmosphere is nearly saturated, the enhanced condensation and cooling at the fog top allow droplets to grow larger despite high aerosol concentrations.The study stresses controlling aerosol emissions is not only essential for cleaner air, but may also be critical for reducing the intensity and duration of winter fog in northern India.","Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern India, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl.

North, N-W India to see more coldwave days than normal

NEW DELHI: Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely to continue in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand for two more days (Jan 12-13), IMD said Sunday. The forecast and prevailing conditions in north India are in sync with the Met department's earlier prediction about this winter witnessing four-five additional cold wave days, reports Vishwa Mohan.On Sunday, Pilani (east Rajasthan) was the coldest spot in the northern plains at 1.2 degrees C. IMD said cold wave conditions may continue in ""isolated pockets"" of north and northwest India on Jan 14 (Wednesday) and ease thereafter. It predicted ""cold day"" in isolated parts of Bihar till Jan 16. Dense fog is very likely to continue during morning hours over northwest India and Bihar for the next five days, it added.D ense fog continuing during morning hours over the next few days means cold wave and foggy morning conditions may coincide with both Lohri and Makar Sankranti celebrations in most parts of north and northwest India, and parts of east India.The states in north and northwest India normally get four to six coldwave days from Dec to Feb, but this time the region is expected to get a total of eight to 11 such days, with the maximum number being reported in Jan.A coldwave is declared when the minimum (night) temperature of a meteorological station is 4°C or less in the plains and 0°C or less in hilly regions. Coldwave conditions can also be declared if temperatures are less than 10°C and below normal by at least 4.5°C. Releasing a forecast of minimum (night) temperatures, IMD said “no significant change” is likely over northwest India in the next three days, with a gradual rise of 2–3°C in the subsequent four days.However, it said, there may be gradual rise in minimum temperature of 2–3°C in Maharashtra over the next two days. There may not be significant change over the subsequent five days. During the past 24 hours (till 8.30am on Sunday), minimum (night) temperatures were below 0°C at many places in J&K, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, a few places in Himachal Pradesh, and at isolated places in Uttarakhand. Minimum temperatures of 1–5°C were recorded at a few places in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan, IMD said.On the other hand, minimum temperatures of 5–10°C were recorded at many places in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh; a few places in Odisha, Bihar, east Rajasthan and Gujarat; and at isolated places in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya and Maharashtra. Minimum temperatures were 3–6°C “below normal” over northwest India (south Punjab, south Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan), northwest Telangana and adjoining Maharashtra on Sunday. Over the rest of the country, they were “near normal” during past 24 hours.","North, N-W India to see more coldwave days than normal, IMD says.

"Assam's tribute to Zubeen Garg: GST from final film Roi Roi Binale to be donated; funds to support flood victims, needy students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assams-tribute-to-zubeen-garg-gst-from-final-film-roi-roi-binale-to-be-donated-funds-to-support-flood-victims-needy-students/articleshow/124933093.cms,"The Assam government will be donating its entire share of GST collected from the upcoming Assamese film Roi Roi Binale, the last movie featuring Zubeen Garg . The amount will be handed over to the Kalaguru Artiste Foundation, a charitable organisation set up by the late singer for humanitarian work.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters on Wednesday that there is no entertainment tax levied on films in the state. He clarified that this means there is no scope to offer any waiver, as some people had demanded.""The state government will exclusively hand over its share of the GST realised from the movie to the Kalaguru Artiste Foundation to support medical treatment of artistes, help flood victims, and assist needy students in their academic pursuits,"" Sarma said.He explained that the GST applicable on cinema tickets varies depending on the ticket price. “For movie tickets above Rs 100, there is 18% GST and it is 5% GST for tickets priced below Rs 100. The state share is half of that rate and we will get the money later. We will then hand it over to the foundation,” he added. The CM also mentioned that the decision was finalised after Garg’s wife agreed to the proposal.The Kalaguru Artiste Foundation, created by Garg, carries out philanthropic activities in Assam.Alongside this announcement, the chief minister also listed several other decisions cleared by the cabinet, including financial approval for the second phase of the Asian Development Bank-backed ‘Climate Resilient Brahmaputra Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management Project’.The state has earmarked Rs 2,205.75 crore as additional funding for this phase. The project will be implemented by the Flood and River Erosion Management Agency of Assam, acting as the project management unit, while the Water Resources Department and the Assam Agroforestry Development Board (AADB) will serve as the project implementation units.In another major decision, the cabinet approved the settlement of hereditary land rights for members of the Moran and Matak communities. The chief minister said this would follow the same model used for tribal communities under Mission Basundhara 2.0.","The state government will be donating its entire share of GST collected from the upcoming Assamese film Roi Roi Binale.

"In Bihar’s Jawaniya, a river runs where a village once was",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-bihars-jawaniya-a-river-runs-where-a-village-once-was/articleshow/124928506.cms,"A Void For Home

Weighing Choices

JAWANIYA (BHOJPUR): Rivers give in abundance. But when swollen with fury, they plunder without mercy. This July, the primeval Ganga took everything that belonged to this riverine village in Bhojpur district of Bihar. It became a land grabber, a livelihood snatcher, a home wrecker and, as one gathers after visiting the habitation, a destroyer of dreams.Parts of Jawaniya now look like a lunatic’s playground — houses carved into pieces like cakes, dead bamboo forests and roads that abruptly end before a rivercreated precipice. About 200 homes, two water tanks, two schools and three temples were swallowed in the swirling waters. Over 300 bighas (1 bigha equals to 0.6 acres) of fecund land were gnawed away. Ward No. 5, and much of Ward No. 4, don’t exist anymore. Substantial parts of the village are now deemed unsafe. Jawaniya is comatose.Eighty-one-year-old Sriram Sahu has lived through many floods, but none like this. “I’d never seen so much water, such strong currents,” he says. Vijay Thakur, who lost 90% of his land, affirms. “Flood doesn’t scare us,” he says. “Soil erosion (katav) does. We had never imagined it would be this bad.”Ward member Ashish Pandey says the only mercy was that nobody died. “We managed to empty the homes in advance,” he says.The river has left a gaping hole in every Jawaniya heart. The loss of homes isn’t just financial. The sudden physical erasure of a place — where everyone lived, loved and grew up — has filled most villagers with an unbearable melancholy. “Ghar nahi raha, bas ab ghar ka moh bhar hai (There’s no home anymore, just a yearning for it),” says Sandeep Chaudhary of the EBC Bind community. Like most who lost their homes, his family has moved to a bandh (embankment), over a kilometre away. But, like a restless vagabond, he returns to the riverbank every now and then.The embankment is a narrow strip; barely wide enough to set up a tent. To walk to the other side, you gingerly trudge up the slope. The camps are made of canvas and reed. These are survival units where you’ll find sewing machines, gas cylinders, and old trunks kept messily for lack of space. A man sleeps on a charpoy beside a buffalo while a girl pets a rooster on her lap. “I can endure. But my kids haven’t seen hard times. How can they bear all this?,” says a tearyeyed middle-aged woman.In one of the tents, Sandeep’s younger brother, Vijay, is studying mathematics. He is preparing for his Class 12 examinations. They earlier lived in a concrete home with eight rooms. Four of them have fallen into the river, parts of the remaining half hang in the air like a person standing on one leg. Their father, a sharecropper, had toiled all his life to build the house. Scattered school notebooks and a pitch-black hearth tells the story of a hurried evacuation amid a bed of red hibiscus flowers that looks incongruous in these glum surroundings.The family belongings are stored in four places. Some items are with their married sister, who lives about 20km away; the remaining articles are kept either at a temple, or with a friend. Only the bare necessities are at the embankment. Like some others, the Chaudharys are building a reed hut at some distance from the riverbank. “We haven’t left the village. But the village has left us,” says Sandeep.Neeraj’s father, Mangru, is not at home. He is campaigning for the BJP candidate, Rakesh Ojha. So is Pawan Thakur, a bhumihar by caste, who owned 20 bighas of land and is now homeless, landless and jobless. A group of eight men have travelled on motorbikes to a nearby village, where UP deputy CM and BJP leader Keshav Prasad Maurya is addressing an election meeting.A village of yadavs, brahmins, binds, gonds (tribals) and bhumihars, Jawaniya has about 1,500 voters. The Shahpur assembly seat, of which it is a part, has been mostly held by RJD. Two-time MLA Rahul Tiwary is now aiming for a hat-trick. Both candidates have visited Jawaniya.Sentiments, barring those among the yadavs, seem more inclined towards Ojha, described as a “naya yuva chehra (a new youthful face)”. Locals say that he ran a langar (free food service) during the floods. Among others who provided relief materials was Bhojpuri singer-actor Pawan Singh, who distributed 1,500 tents and 2,000 bamboo poles. Jan Suraaj leader Prashant Kishor spent Diwali with the villagers.Nearby villages such as Karja Bazaar were also flooded in July. The waters have receded. But in Jawaniya, they have left behind a sandy bed. Earlier the land, locals say, was fit for wheat, pulses, millets and sesame. “Now we can only grow watermelons,” says Neeraj.Jawaniya is conjoined with another village, Chakki Naurangia, both on the Bihar-Uttar Pradesh border. Homes and lands in both villages have been lost forever. “The district administration ran a flood relief camp for two and a half months. Every family received a gratuity of Rs 7,000,” says Tanai Sultania, DM, Bhojpur, over the phone. It is also learnt that house compensation has been partially disbursed and the villagers are likely to be settled in Bilauti, about 30km away. But several villagers said they haven’t received the compensation yet.Vijay Ram, a Dalit, from Chakki Naurangia, stands staring at the river. Like many others, he has moved to the relief camp. The melancholy of loss, he says, lingers. “This village is my birthplace — I keep coming back,” he explains. Today, he has brought his wife to the riverbank. She wanted to see their ‘home’. He points about 200 metres away. “That’s where it was,” he tells her. There’s nothing there, only a river now at peace with itself.","This July, the primeval Ganga took everything that belonged to this riverine village in Bhojpur district of Bihar.

Radha Kapoor and Roshini Kapoor, daughters of Yes Bank's former MD and CEO Rana Kapoor , are the promoters/directors of Morgan Credits.The CBI said Anil and Jai interfered in the decision-making process at Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund without informing its Japanese partner, prompting objections and allegations. It said Jai held monthly review meetings with the mutual fund firm's officers, expressed displeasure over their performance, and directed that he be informed of any mutual fund investment of 50 crore or more before execution. This interference led to internal objections, but the directives were eventually withdrawn, the chargesheet stated.It alleged that Anil entered into a criminal conspiracy with Kapoor to get the bank to subscribe to his group companies' NCDs and commercial papers (CPs) worth 3,400 crore ""when there was no demand for them in the secondary market."" It further alleged that Kapoor pushed for the NCDs' acquisition despite knowing that holding them for an extended period would harm the bank.The chargesheet said that in return, Kapoor's wife, Bindu, received credit facilities of 570 crore from Anil's companies at a lower interest rate. ""...Yes Bank Limited suffered a total loss of 2,796.77 crore due to subscribing to NCDs and CPs of RHFL (Reliance Home Finance Ltd) and RCFL (Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd),"" the chargesheet stated.The CBI has named 13 accused in the chargesheet, including Bindu, Kapoor, Radha, and Roshini. None of them has been arrested. The agency also said it is probing the role of another daughter of the Kapoors, Rakhee.The chargesheet said Kapoor and Anil held frequent meetings, but no bank officer attended these. Following these discussions, Kapoor instructed his bank officers to process proposals for Anil's companies, it said.","Jai Anmol Ambani was executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd.

NEW DELHI: Mocking Ottawa's decision to designate it a terror group, Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for Monday's killing of 68-year-old Indian-origin millionaire Canadian businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi. The group said the target refused to pay ""protection money"", reports Rajshekhar Jha.The group has also claimed responsibility for firing at Punjabi singer Channi Nattan's residence in Canada while warning the music industry against working with singer Saradar Khera. It released videos of both shootings.Coming after Canadian authorities designated it a terrorist outfit, the twin incidents signal Bishnoi gang's defiance while underlining both its reach and capability to strike at will in the country.Sahsi was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning. He hailed from Ludhiana and was president of Canam International, a leading clothing recycling firm.Goldy Dhillon of the Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility for the murder through a social media post which alleged that Sahsi was involved in a drug-trafficking operation and had been asked for money by the gang, which he refused to pay and even blocked their number.The sensational killing had prompted brief lockdowns of schools in the neighbourhood as the Abbotsford police patrol officers responded to the shooting.In the second incident, the Bishnoi group stated that the attack was carried out because Channi Nattan was reportedly ""developing close ties"" with fellow singer Saradar Khera. Making the claim, Goldy Dhillon also released a video of the firing. ""Sat Sri Akal! I am Goldy Dhillon (Lawrence Bishnoi Gang). Reason for the firing at singer Channi Nattan's house yesterday is Saradar Khera.""The gang issued a warning to the music industry: ""Any singer who works with or maintains a relationship with Saradar Khera will be solely responsible for their own loss. This is because we will continue to inflict significant damage upon Khera.""Canada designating it a 'terrorist entity' was largely seen as a blow to the Bishnoi gang. The move, seen as having been prompted by pressure from the pro-Khalistani groups who have blamed Bishnoi for the assassination of Hardip Singh Nijjar, a terrorist wanted in India, was supposed to enable law enforcement agencies to use significant investigative tools and access the resources needed to disrupt operations of the gang.The terrorist designation also unlocks critical powers, allowing Canadian police to prosecute offences pertaining to financing, travel and recruitment. A terrorist listing means anything owned by that group in Canada - property, vehicles or money - can be frozen or seized.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for killing of Indian-origin Canadian businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi.

Purpose not to usurp HCs' powers, looking at norms for uniformity: SC



NEW DELHI: Undercurrents of two-decade-long discontent over the apex court framing service rules for state judicial officers brimmed over on Wednesday with the Allahabad high court bluntly telling Supreme Court to adopt a ""hands-off approach"" over the issue.Allahabad HC, which in the recent past has been censured by Supreme Court for delays in deciding cases, said, ""The SC should leave it to the HCs to chalk out the framework for ensuring adequate promotional avenues to career judicial officers and direct recruit district judges. Article 227(1) gives HCs superintendence over district judiciary.""Representing the high court, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, ""Why should the high courts be divested of their authority and duty under the Constitution? It is time to strengthen the HCs, not weaken them. Things have gone too far.""In 2017, the SC had in principle finalised a concept paper advocating that SC should conduct the recruitment test for direct appointee district judges from among advocates. We protested and it was stalled. SC can't be fixing retirement age, quota for the career judicial officers and eligibility"", Dwivedi, representing Allahabad HC, said.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi said the concept of an All India Judicial Service is still alive and if it comes to fruition, SC may have some role to play in framing uniform service rules for the district judiciary.Justice Kant, the next CJI, said, ""The purpose of present proceedings is not to usurp the powers of HCs in relation to district judiciary. We are considering whether a general guideline is needed to bring in some uniformity in promotions to the post of district judge. ""There are states where a person who joins as a civil judge junior division and through the seniority-cum-merit route takes two decades to become a district judge (DJ), but lawyers with 10 years' practice can clear an examination to become district judges. There is a third category under which judicial officers, through limited departmental competitive examination, can become DJs.The ratio for promotion to DJ's post was 50-25-25 in 2002, which was made 65-25-10 in 2010 and again reverted to 50-25-25 by SC. CJI Gavai said, ""We do not even remotely intend to take away powers of the HCs"" but asked why Allahabad HC is so averse to a uniform service rule for judicial officers and what suggestions it has to offer.Dwivedi said, ""I am not giving any suggestion but persuading the SC to adopt a hands-off approach on this issue. The service conditions vary from state to state, and HC is in the best position to consider these aspects while framing service rules. SC can interfere in those cases where the HC is unable to manage the affairs of the subordinate judiciary or where the administration of justice in district courts has broken down. .."" he said, and argued against any quota for judicial officers' promotion to DJ posts.For Punjab and Haryana HC, senior advocate Maninder Acharya said the present system is working well in the two states and there is no need for SC to create a quota for career judicial officers. For direct-recruit DJs from Kerala, Bihar and Delhi, the advocates supported the argument that SC should not tweak present promotion procedure.","Allahabad high court bluntly tells Supreme Court to adopt a ""hands-off approach"" over the issue.

Punjabi-Canadian Businessman Darshan Sahsi Shot Dead Outside Home in Suspected Targeted Killing





NEW DELHI: A chilling video has emerged showing the killing of Darshan Singh Sahsi, a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman, who was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning.The video shows that as unsuspecting Dharshan Singh sits in his car, an assailant quietly tiptoes toward the vehicle on a busy road and opens fire from close range.Sahsi, originally from Ludhiana and the president of Canam International, a well-known clothing recycling firm, was found with fatal gunshot wounds inside his vehicle.Police said the attack was targeted.According to investigators, the shooter lay in wait in a parked car, and as soon as Sahsi entered his vehicle, the assailant opened fire before fleeing the area.A homicide probe is now underway.Soon after the incident, Goldy Dhillon, a close aide of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi , claimed responsibility on social media. Dhillon alleged that Sahsi had refused to pay extortion money demanded by the gang and even blocked their number.The post claimed Sahsi was “involved in drug trafficking” and was “punished” for denying the demand — a claim that police have not verified.The murder comes just weeks after the Canadian government declared the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate a ‘terrorist entity’, giving law enforcement agencies greater powers to seize assets, track funding, and curb gang operations.Despite the designation, Bishnoi’s gang has continued violent operations in Canada. Dhillon recently took credit for drive-by shootings at multiple locations in Surrey and Maple Ridge, as well as an attack on comedian Kapil Sharma’s café in Canada.Abbotsford Police said they are reviewing the video evidence and working with federal agencies to determine any cross-border links.The Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate claimed responsibility for the killing of a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman who was shot dead in his car in Canada in a targeted shooting.","Darshan Singh Sahsi, a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman, was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.

Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

Odisha, TN to get rain





KAKINADA (ANDHRA PRADESH): Cyclonic storm Montha in Bay of Bengal was on Monday headed towards Andhra Pradesh, where it’s expected to cross the coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam after making a landfall near Kakinada around midnight on Tuesday before moving towards southern Odisha.The season’s first major storm, currently centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and moving northnorthwestward, is expected to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” before making landfall with wind speeds of 90-100 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 110 kmph.Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and East Godavari on high alert. CM N Chandrababu Naidu has asked officials to prevent any cyclone-related deaths.Civil supplies minister Nadendla Manhor, the incharge minister for Eluru, who held a review meeting at Kakinada collectorate on Monday, said 269 rehabilitation centres have been set up with all facilities, while 30 NDRF and 50 SDRF teams have been pressed into service. Earthmovers, tractors and generators with enough fuel stocks have been kept ready.“Nearly 140 pregnant women from nearby villages have been shifted to hospitals.Essential goods and medicines have been kept ready, and holidays have been declared for all educational institutions till Wednesday. All fishing boats have been recalled from the sea,” he said.While Andhra Pradesh will bear the brunt of the storm, with red and orange alerts issued for 23 districts, the south-coastal districts of neighbouring Odisha are likely to witness heavy rainfall and strong winds. The northern districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, are expected to receive heavy rains.Meanwhile, in Odisha, the state govt on Monday evacuated 3,000 people from vulnerable areas as the storm triggered rain across Bhubaneswar and southern parts of the state.Among those evacuated are 1,496 women in advanced stages of pregnancy, who have been shifted to hospitals.As many as 140 teams from NDRF, ODRAF and fire services personnel have been deployed, while schools and anganwadi centres have been shut in eight red zone districts till Thursday.Authorities are closely monitoring Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput and Malkangiri districts for possible landslides.","Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and EastGodavari on high alert.

New work permit rule for legal immigrants in the US: What actually changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/new-work-permit-rule-for-legal-immigrants-in-the-us-what-actually-changes/articleshow/124918420.cms,"New US work permit rule ends automatic EAD extensions for immigrants.

Who will be affected by the new rule

Reason for ending automatic extensions

Implications for families and workers

Key changes under the new US work permit rule

The US administration has introduced a new rule that ends the automatic extension of employment authorisation for certain legal immigrants. Previously, under the Biden administration, migrants could continue working legally after their work permit expired if they had filed a renewal application on time. From now on, all applicants will undergo fresh vetting and screening before their employment authorisation is extended.The change affects multiple groups, including spouses of H-1B and O-1 visa holders who rely on an Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) to work. Green card holders and visa holders such as H-1B, L-1 or O-1 do not need a work permit and are not directly impacted. The new rule comes into effect immediately, meaning applicants filing for renewal on or after October 30, 2025, will no longer benefit from automatic extensions.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Joseph Edlow said the agency, under President Trump’s orders, is emphasising the vetting of all applicants. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorisation or documentation is extended,” Edlow said, as quoted by USCIS.The rule impacts H-4 visa holders, the spouses of H-1B workers, and certain categories of F-1 students under Optional Practical Training (OPT).Pending asylum applicants who receive an EAD will also be affected. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) advised migrants to file renewal applications up to 180 days before expiry to avoid potential gaps in work authorisation.The DHS explained that ending automatic EAD extensions allows for more frequent background checks and fraud detection. “Reviewing an alien’s background more often will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US,” DHS said in a statement. The rule provides limited exceptions, including extensions mandated by law or through Federal Register notices for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) work documentation.Immigration experts highlighted that the change could create gaps in employment for spouses reliant on EADs if processing times are delayed. David J Bier of the Cato Institute said in conversation with US media, “Another rule imposed immediately without notice and public comment periods because it is somehow an emergency to stop people from working solely because of government ineptitude.”Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney, told reporters that if vetting were truly the concern, USCIS could review applicants’ backgrounds at any time. “The agency’s own inefficient processing times created the need for automatic extensions in the first place,” Neumann said.USCIS emphasised that EADs automatically extended before October 30, 2025, will not be affected by the rule. Migrants are urged to submit renewals promptly to maintain uninterrupted work authorisation.• Automatic extensions of Employment Authorisation Documents (EADs) for certain legal immigrants end from October 30, 2025.• Applicants filing renewal applications on or after this date will not be allowed to continue working automatically.• USCIS will conduct fresh vetting and background checks before approving any EAD renewal.• H-4 visa holders (spouses of H-1B workers) and some F-1 students under OPT are directly affected.• Green card holders and visa holders such as H-1B, L-1, or O-1 are not impacted.• Pending asylum applicants with EADs are also subject to the new vetting rule.• DHS advises migrants to file renewals up to 180 days before expiry to avoid work gaps.• Limited exceptions exist for extensions required by law or through Federal Register notices (e.g., TPS).• Previously auto-extended EADs before October 30, 2025, remain valid and unaffected.","The US administration has introduced a new rule that ends the automatic extension of employment authorisation for certain legal immigrants.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.",US President Donald Trump hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air

The Experiment: Delhi Tries to Play Storm



Give them the forecast (Storm destroys Sentinels in X-Men 97)

The Good: When Cloud-Seeding Actually Works



In short:

Cloud-seeding can work when conditions are right — it’s proven science, not science fiction.

It has history — the first experiments began in the 1930s, and GE scientists refined the silver iodide method in the 1940s.

It can temporarily clean the air — even light drizzle helps wash particulate matter out of the atmosphere.

The Bad: Why Delhi’s Skies Refused



Delhi Stays Dry; IIT-K Says Trace Rain In Noida

The Ugly: It never rains, it pours



The Takeaway: The Real Fight Is on the Ground



In the X-Men universe, an Omega-level mutant is defined as one whose dominant power has no upper limit. Among them was Ororo Munroe, better known by her moniker Storm , who could make it rain at will because she could control the entire planetary ecosystem. This led Magneto, in the X-Men ’97 reboot, to refer to her as the closest thing to a divine being, which in essence is what humans have been trying to do since we arrived on earth. We have managed to fly distant continents, split the atom, create antimatter, build machines that mimic the mind, map the human genome, reach the moon, grow meat without animals and diamonds in a lab — but we still struggle to, like Storm, make it rain at will.And yet, every so often, we try. From Beijing to Dubai, humans have spent decades firing silver iodide into clouds, hoping to bend the weather to our will. The latest to attempt this act of atmospheric persuasion was Delhi — a city so desperate for clean air it decided to summon rain from a clear sky.As the capital’s air turned toxic this October, officials tried what man dreams of – making it rain. The Delhi government signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT-Kanpur for a ₹3.2 crore cloud-seeding project, costing roughly ₹64 lakh per trial.The plan: send small Cessna planes to spray silver iodide flares into the sky, hoping to coax moisture from passing clouds.After three sorties over north Delhi, no significant rainfall was recorded. The Air Quality Index stayed locked in the “poor” to “very poor” range. It wasn’t the first time Delhi tried this; earlier attempts in 1957 and the 1970s had fizzled out too. Seven decades later, the capital cannot summon rain.To be fair, cloud-seeding is real science, not magic. The idea dates back nearly a century. By dispersing tiny particles — typically silver iodide or dry ice — into moisture-rich clouds, scientists can trigger condensation, forming heavier droplets that fall as rain. Under the right conditions, studies show seeding can boost rainfall by 5–15%.India’s own experiments have produced promising results. The IITM’s CAIPEEX programme over drought-prone Maharashtra recorded rainfall increases of up to 46% on seeded days. Research by IIT-Kanpur and the IMD also found measurable gains when the atmosphere was suitably humid.Other countries have gone further. China, the UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia and even Pakistan regularly conduct cloud-seeding operations — to induce rain for agriculture, combat smog, or clear skies before major events. The principle is straightforward: if clouds are ripe, give them a nudge.If Delhi’s skies had resembled monsoon season, the plan might have bought the city a brief reprieve. Unfortunately, nature didn’t cooperate.The failure wasn’t surprising. The skies above Delhi simply didn’t have enough to give. Humidity during the trials hovered around 20%. The clouds themselves carried only about 15–20% moisture — far too little for the silver iodide particles to latch onto. As one IIT Delhi scientist told TOI , “You can’t seed what isn’t there.” Then there was the cost. Each sortie ran up a bill of around ₹64 lakh. Three flights later, Delhi saw barely 0.1–0.2 mm of drizzle in Noida and NCR. Crores spent, for a few drops on the windshield.Even if the mission had succeeded, experts warned the impact would have been fleeting. Pollution in Delhi is relentless — driven by vehicles, factories, construction dust and seasonal stubble burning. A passing drizzle might wash away particulates for a few hours, but the smog returns as soon as emissions resume.Environmentalists called it a gimmick. As one told TOI: “Artificial rain is symbolic, not a real solution."" Without curbing pollution at its source, they argue, cloud-seeding is little more than an atmospheric placebo — a photo-op in the sky while the ground burns below.For a cautionary tale, one need only look west. In April 2024, Dubai was hit by record-breaking floods — a year’s worth of rain in a single day — prompting viral claims that the UAE’s cloud-seeding had gone rogue. Meteorologists quickly debunked it.As the Associated Press reported, the deluge was purely natural, caused by a large storm system. The UAE’s National Meteorology Centre confirmed that no seeding flights were conducted during the event. “You don’t need cloud seeding’s influence to account for the record deluge,” noted Yale meteorologist Jeff Masters back then.Still, the incident was telling. Weather manipulation has always carried the whiff of hubris — the belief that we can outthink chaos. The same misgivings surfaced in Saudi Arabia in 2020, when unseasonal rains sparked rumours of a “seeding disaster.” No evidence emerged, but the perception lingered: tamper with the skies, and you risk taking the blame when nature pushes back.Delhi’s cloud-seeding project joins a long line of grand, short-lived solutions to deep-rooted problems. Like Dubai’s floods or Beijing’s Olympic “blue sky” campaigns, these attempts make for good optics but poor outcomes.If India truly wants clean air, it must look down, not up — towards sustained emission cuts, stricter enforcement, and cleaner energy. The technology that could save Delhi already exists on the ground: electric mobility, dust control, crop management. No silver iodide flare can substitute for political will.Because unlike Storm, we can’t command the weather. And unlike gods, we don’t control chaos. All we can do is face the smoke we made — and start cleaning it up.","Cloud-seeding is proven science, not science fiction.

'Nitish ji's face being used': Rahul

NEW DELHI: Weeks after the Election Commission announced poll dates in Bihar -- and days after the Mahagathbandhan released its chief ministerial face -- leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi finally kicked off his election campaign in the state on Wednesday. Addressing a rally in Muzaffarpur, the Congress leader launched a fierce attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , claiming that ""he just wants vote"" and alleging that he would go to any extent to win elections.“He just wants your vote. If 200 people from the crowd ask PM Modi to dance on stage in return for votes, the dance would begin. PM Modi will start performing Bharatnatyam on stage,” Rahul said.Taking a swipe at the Prime Minister’s statement on Chhath Puja observance on the banks of the Yamuna, Rahul mocked the act, saying, “They staged a drama and showed the truth of India... The Yamuna has dirty water. If someone drank it, they would either get sick or die. No one can go inside. The water is so dirty that if you enter it, you would get sick or get an infection... But Modi staged a drama. He built a small pond there. .. They will show you anything for elections... A pipe is installed from behind. Clean water is poured into it... The problem arose that someone took a photo of the pipe..”Continuing his tirade, Rahul reiterated his charge of “vote chori” and accused the BJP of subverting democracy. “They are engaged in stealing your votes.Because they want to end this election disease. I am telling you, they stole elections in Maharashtra, they stole elections in Haryana, and they will try their best in Bihar,” he said.The Congress leader also hit out at PM Modi over economic policies, accusing him of crushing small businesses through demonetisation and GST. “Tell me what is written on the back of your phone. Made in China. Narendra Modi ji has destroyed all the small businesses by implementing demonetisation and GST. Wherever you look, it is Made in China. We say that it should not be Made in China, it should be Made in Bihar. Mobiles, shirts, pants — all these should be made in Bihar and the youth of Bihar should get employment in those factories. We want such a Bihar,” he declared.BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari on Wednesday hit back at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over his remark that “PM Modi will dance for votes,” branding him a “local goon.”Bhandari accused the Congress leader of “mocking voters” and “insulting” the poor with his comments.In a post on X, the BJP leader said, “Rahul Gandhi speaks like a ‘Local Goon’. Rahul Gandhi has openly insulted every poor of India, & Bihar who has voted for PM Narendra Modi ji! Rahul Gandhi has mocked voters and Indian democracy.”Rahul didn’t spare Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar either, claiming he was merely a “face” while the BJP pulled the strings from behind. “Nitish ji’s face is being used. The remote control is in the hands of the BJP. You should not think that the voice of the most backward people is heard there,” he said.Accusing the BJP of being “against social justice,” Rahul added, “Three or four people control it. BJP controls it. They have the remote controller in their hands, and they have nothing to do with social justice. I said in front of the Prime Minister in the Lok Sabha that you should get the caste census done. He did not say a single word... BJP is against social justice. They do not want it.”As Bihar gears up for a high-stakes battle, the political lines are clearly drawn. The NDA -- comprising the BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha -- faces off against the Mahagathbandhan, led by the RJD and including Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP.Adding another twist, Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj has announced candidates for all 243 assembly seats. Bihar will vote in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.","Rahul Gandhi kicks off his election campaign in Bihar on Wednesday.

"India, China hold talks again, but de-escalation far off on ground",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-hold-talks-again-but-de-escalation-far-off-on-ground/articleshow/124922210.cms,"India Rising, China Shrinking: Ex-Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong Predicts Major Power Shift in Asia

NEW DELHI: A year after troop disengagement between India and China from the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, there is as yet no actual de-escalation on the ground with the rival armies set to remain forward deployed for the sixth successive winter in the forbidding high-altitude terrain.The military thrust amid the ongoing diplomatic détente is to manage tensions and “maintain peace and tranquillity” all along the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA), however, continues with its relentless infrastructure build-up along the frontier.At the 23rd round of corps commander-level meeting at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in eastern Ladakh on Oct 25, “both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability”, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday.This was the first meeting of the “general-level mechanism” in the western sector of the LAC since the 24th round of special representatives talks between national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Aug this year.The meeting between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief was held in “a friendly and cordial atmosphere”. The two sides “noted the progress” since the 22nd round between them a year ago and “shared the view that peace and tranquillity has been maintained in the border areas”, the MEA said.The troop disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, along with “coordinated patrolling” by the rival troops there, has certainly reduced the chances of any clashes and inadvertent vertical escalation. The trust deficit, however, remains high, sources said.De-escalation and the consequent de-induction of troops, which will require return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations, and the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020 are “still nowhere on the horizon”, the sources added.After initially being caught off-guard, India had pumped in well over 50,000 troops into eastern Ladakh, along with heavy weapon systems like tanks, howitzers and surface-to-air missile systems, to match the PLA after it made multiple incursions into the region in April-May 2020. Similar “mirroring” of forward troop deployments took place in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC as well.“Over five years later, there have been some troop reductions, which in any case is done during the winters. But the bulk of the troops from either side remain in place. There is an uneasy calm,” a source said.China’s continuing massive infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, which ensures it can rush additional troops and weapons to forward areas many times faster than India, remains a major concern.Similarly, China has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at its airfields facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi, Lhunze and Hoping after upgrading them with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, as reported earlier by TOI.Restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022 is also yet to take place.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” in patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, which largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.","The military thrust amid the ongoing diplomatic détente is to manage tensions and “maintain peace and tranquillity” The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continues with its relentless infrastructure build-up along the frontier.

""The anthem was sung with the reverence reserved for India's own,"" he said Wednesday.The row erupted after Congress functionary Bidhu Bhushan Das sang ""Amar Sonar Bangla, Ami Tomay Bhalobasi"" during a Congress Seva Dal meeting.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP 's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" that seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.Omar, already facing allegations about last Friday's Rajya Sabha election being ""a fixed match"" after BJP won one of the four seats at stake, received a rare shout-out from the saffron party later for rejecting PDP's land bill ""in national interest"".""How can this bill be justified when it seeks to legitimise illegal constructions on state land?"" Omar said in the House before speaker Abdul Rahim Rather put the bill to vote. ""If it is passed, it would mean that anyone who builds a house on state land tomorrow can claim it as their own. That is simply unacceptable,"" he added.The rebuff came less than a week after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti declared at a presser that her party had agreed to support NC in the Rajya Sabha election on the condition that the governing party would back its J&K (Regularisation and Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Public Land) Bill.""BJP's threat to block the passage of PDP's land regularisation (anti-bulldozer) bill, which they branded the 'land jihad bill', was fulfilled today,"" Mehbooba wrote on X after the move was voted out. ""The chief minister, who had earlier assured that any pro-people initiative from PDP would face no obstacles under his leadership, has once again reneged on his word. This marks yet another U-turn added to his growing list of unfulfilled guarantees and promises. ""The draft of the rejected bill defines ""residents"" as those holding permanent resident certificates, which were replaced with domicile certificates after the abrogation of Article 370. PDP projects the bill as one meant to safeguard the rights of J&K residents who are being slapped with eviction notices.CM Omar harked back to the defunct Roshni Act being challenged in court and defeated despite what he said was a well-intentioned move to ""provide relief to people who had acquired legal rights over land"".""Here, this bill is justifying illegal encroachment,"" he said, urging PDP member Waheed Parra to withdraw it immediately.Parra refused to do so, accusing Omar of siding with BJP and against the interest of those living in J&K. ""BJP calls this bill 'land jihad', and now you are backing away from it? You should debate the bill; if there are any loopholes, we can fix them,"" he said.When the PDP legislator told Omar that ""even your relatives have suffered on account of this"", alluding to the controversy surrounding Hotel Nedous in Gulmarg, the CM stood up to clarify that his kin had ""a rightful lease over the land"".""But I will not bring a bill to protect my relatives"" Omar said. ""You are bringing religion and politics into this. You should not compare land for the landless with this bill.""BJP MLA Sunil Sharma applauded and thanked the CM for taking what he said was a decisive step against ""a notorious bill"" to regularise encroachment.

International public adaptation finance flows to developing countries, in fact, declined from $28 billion in 2022 to $26 billion in 2023.""Climate impacts are accelerating.

""Rahul has not insulted PM Modi, but he has insulted Chhathi Maiya and her devotees.

Whether it’s planning, execution or communication, we can’t work in silos. There should be one overarching narrative, which means every ministry should reinforce the same national goals,” said an official.Officials also said every department has been asked to focus on digital and social media for govt-citizen communication, considering that over 900 million people in India are active online at any time — more than 600 million on social media — and that on an average an Indian spends 2.5 hours daily on digital platforms. They were also informed how nearly 65% Indians are of less than 35 years and they prefer reels, memes, podcasts and social media conversations.","Citizens don’t distinguish between ministries as for them there is only ‘one Govt of India’, P K Mishra, principal secretary to PM Narendra Modi, told the country’s top bureaucrats.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over delay in framing of charges which derail trial in criminal cases, Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to deal with the problem by passing pan-India guidelines for implementation of provision of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) which says that a court shall frame a charge against the accused within a period of 60 days from the date of first hearing.Taking note that many courts across the country take months and years in framing of charges, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said that the problem needed to be addressed and requested attorney general R Venkataramani to guide the court in the case and also appointed noted criminal lawyer Siddharth Luthra as amicus curiae to assist the court.BNSS, which replaced colonial era Criminal Procedure Code, sets specific timelines for criminal investigations and trials but it seems to remain only in the rule book and not being implemented on ground, resulting in trials getting delayed like earlier times.""Perusal of Section 251 BNSS, which governs framing of charges, read thus. Clause b of 251 indicates that where the matter is exclusively triable by the court, it should frame charges within 60 days of the first hearing on the charge. We have noticed, time and again, the charges are not being framed even after months and years after framing of chargesheet. This is one of the primary reasons for the trial getting delayed.Until and unless it is framed, trial will not commence. As such, this situation seems to be prevalent in most of the courts and we are of the considered opinion that certain directions need to be issued pan India in this regard,"" the bench said.The court passed the order while hearing a bail plea of an accused from Bihar who had been in jail for the last one year. It was brought to court's notice that charges in the case had not been framed in the last one year by the court. The bench decided that it was a fit case to intervene to address the problem of delay in framing of charge and expanded the ambit of the case.Earlier in this month, another bench of the apex court had earlier also flagged the issue of delay in framing of charge and had noted that charges had not been framed by trial court in Maharashtra despite chargesheets being filed years ago and trials had not commenced in at least 649 criminal cases.",Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said that the problem needed to be addressed.

Have RTI query? Take a scooter instead. Why answer seekers in Kashmir are hitting a wall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-rti-query-take-a-scooter-instead-why-answer-seekers-in-kashmir-are-hitting-a-wall/articleshow/124915998.cms,"Representative AI image

SRINAGAR: For the law students gathered last week at Tagore Hall — a modest state-run auditorium tucked behind Iqbal Park in Srinagar’s Gogji Bagh — filing RTI applications began as an exercise for their coursework. Soon, though, it became an early education in how power responds to questions. Some received partial replies. Others got silence. One was even offered a scooter. Yet others were contacted by people who suggested it would be better to let things go.Sabika Rasool had filed an RTI request about development meetings in her village in Pulwama. The reply didn’t come at first. A phone call to her father did. “They told him it doesn’t look good that I was filing such applications,” she said. Then came an unexpected offer — a scooter — if she withdrew it.A student at the University of Kashmir, Sabika had filed her request on Aug 1 to the rural development department. She wanted to know how often gram sabha meetings were held and what development works had followed. Her seemingly simple query triggered a quiet but unmistakable response from the local administration.When she visited the office in person, she was directed from one desk to another, only to be told ""the designated officer had been transferred"".A few days later, her father received a call. The caller said it would be better if his daughter didn’t pursue the matter. She received a 32-page reply in Urdu on Oct 15, listing 11 meetings and referencing projects under schemes like Har Ghar Jal. Sabika is not convinced that the data is accurate. But one thing changed: meetings are now announced in mosques. “At least people know when they’re happening,” she said.Dr Peerzada Farhat, the then assistant commissioner (development) at Pulwama, described the scooter claim as a “white lie”. “All data of the rural development department is online and accessible, and in public domain.”Like Sabika, these students had not set out to confront the state. Many had filed their RTIs as part of legal coursework. Yet in department after department, they found that even routine queries were met with delay, redirection, or informal pressure — delivered not through written denials, but through relatives, neighbours, or local influencers.When Idrees Farooq asked about the renovation of a stadium in Ganderbal — seeking costs, contractor names, floodlight installations and revenue from night matches — the response he received cited just Rs 31,500, without any details. Soon after, some of his relatives were contacted by officials. “I had to explain it wasn’t a complaint, just an RTI,” Farooq said.An official from the sports council department said they had responded properly to the RTI and encouraged the applicant to appeal, if unsatisfied. “There is a lot of politics involved in this matter, but despite that, we have provided our response. We do not look at it through a political lens,” she said.Some applicants didn’t receive a reply at all — but their questions still appeared to make something shift. Junaid Budoo, a student from Uri, had asked why a public library appeared on govt rolls but did not function. He heard nothing from the department of libraries. But within weeks, the library opened and staff began reporting for duty. “They didn’t send me a reply,” Budoo said, “but the library started functioning again. ”In Kargil, Ghulam Abbas filed an RTI with the irrigation and flood control department in Ladakh, seeking information about a long-stalled canal project in his village. Weeks later, it wasn’t an official who contacted him but his father — who’d been approached informally. “They told my father that the department had no old records, and my father then advised me to withdraw it,” Abbas said.In March this year, the J&K information technology department issued a press statement asserting that the Union Territory’s RTI portal — launched on Jan 10 — was “fully functional” and operating in compliance with the RTI Act, 2005. According to the department, over 15,800 applications had been filed, with 11,631 disposed and 4,260 in process.The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative reported in 2024 that RTI filings in J&K had fallen by 31% since 2022. The group attributed the decline to lack of oversight, extended delays, limited digital access in rural areas and what it called a “culture of discouragement.”","Law students in J&K filed RTIs as part of their coursework.

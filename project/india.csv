What makes it even more powerful is that the unit is largely women-led, with around 80% women, most aged 19–24, and for many, this is their first job,” Rahul said in his post.“Karnataka is setting an example by creating an ecosystem where manufacturing can grow at this scale and speed. This is the India we must build: jobs with dignity, and opportunities for all,” he added.This comes after the Taiwanese electronics major Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (Foxconn) recruited close to 30,000 employees at its new iPhone assembly facility in Devanahalli near Bengaluru within just eight to nine months, marking the fastest factory scale-up seen in India so far.The 300-acre facility is largely operated by women, who make up around 80% of the workforce. Most of these employees are in the 19–24 age bracket and are entering the workforce for the first time, the report said.","Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw thanked leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi after he hailed job creation at Foxconn in Karnataka.

PRAYAGRAJ: Noting that the trial court failed to notice that the appellant was confessing to a crime out of fear for his life, the Allahabad high court has overturned the conviction of a man who spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case.The trial court had in 2002 delivered its verdict based solely on his admission in his statements recorded under CrPC Section 313. A division bench of Justice JJ Munir and Justice Sanjiv Kumar found fault with the trial judge for failing to notice that the appellant was confessing out of fear for his life.The high court concluded that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant as the prosecution had failed to connect him with the offence. Consequently, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted Azad Khan of all charges. He is to be released forthwith from Mainpuri jail, the high court directed.The division bench ruled in its Dec 19 order that a conviction cannot be premised solely on an admission made in a statement under CrPC Sec 313, especially when the prosecution fails to adduce any corroborative or incriminating evidence.The court termed the incarceration of Azad Khan for almost 24 years as the sad part of the matter, noting that his so-called admission of guilt was likely driven by fear for his life rather than being a genuine confession.The Allahabad high court also noted that the appellant had no assistance of an advocate to defend himself and was not offered or provided any legal aid, which violated the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution (right to life and personal liberty) and also constituted a violation of CrPC Sec 304, which mandates legal aid, at the state's expense, for the accused.In Feb 2002, the appellant was convicted under ICP Secs 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) by the special judge (DAA)/additional sessions judge, Mainpuri.",Azad Khan spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case.

Gujarat: High court lets off dad on death row for pregnant teen’s rape and murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-high-court-lets-off-dad-on-death-row-for-pregnant-teens-rape-and-murder/articleshow/126168975.cms,"Gujarat: High court lets off dad on death row for pregnant teen’s rape and murder

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has acquitted a father sentenced to death by a Surat trial court for the rape and murder of his pregnant teenage daughter, citing procedural lapses for refusing to accept the DNA report that led to his conviction as “credible evidence”.The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from Odisha whose body was found on Surat’s Dumas beach on June 29, 2017. An autopsy revealed she was pregnant and had been strangled to death. After her father’s arrest based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution relied on DNA matching of the foetus and the accused to build what became the “cornerstone” of his Jan 2020 conviction under IPC and the Pocso Act.The case was turned on its head when the state govt sought the high court’s confirmation of the death sentence. “The prosecution failed to prove all necessary circumstances by reliable and clinching evidence, which would constitute a complete chain without a snap, as would permit a conclusion other than the one of the guilt of the accused,” the division bench of Justices Ilesh Vora and R T Vachhani said.The judges ruled that DNA samples of the victim’s unborn baby and the accused may have been “compromised” due to multiple lapses, including a 13-day delay in submitting these to the designated forensic laboratory and failure to preserve highly sensitive biological material in an ice box.","The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from Odisha.

MADURAI: A Pocso court in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.The 49-year-old labourer, an alcoholic, repeatedly sexually assaulted his 14-year-old daughter since Aug 2024. He also threatened the survivor with dire consequences if she revealed the crime to her mother. When she fell ill, her mother took her to primary health centre where doctors found she was pregnant. Upon discovering that her husband had sexually assaulted their daughter, the woman lodged a complaint with an all-women police station in Feb 2025. Police registered a case for offences under the Pocso Act and arrested the accused.Special court judge K Suresh Kumar observed that the harm caused, deliberate misuse of authority, threats, and long-term impact on the survivor demonstrated the extreme seriousness of the offence. Acts committed by those in positions of trust, especially within families, require a strong response to maintain public confidence and protect other children, the judge said.","A Pocso court in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.

Consensual relation with student is not sex harassment: Allahabad high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-relation-with-student-is-not-sex-harassment-allahabad-high-court/articleshow/126168950.cms,"Representative image

PRAYAGRAJ: A teacher being in a consensual relationship with his student amounts to misconduct but not sexual harassment, Allahabad high court has ruled, setting aside a 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj.Allowing a writ petition filed by the sacked lecturer, Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery, in his Dec 16 order, observed that while the petitioner may not have adhered to the high moral standards expected of a teacher, the extreme penalty of dismissal imposed on him in 2006 was shockingly disproportionate.The petitioner was appointed lecturer with the department of computer science and engineering in 1999. The institute took disciplinary action against him following a complaint lodged in 2003 by a former student, who had completed her master’s course in 2000. In her complaint, the student alleged emotional and physical harassment, and claimed that the lecturer had forced a physical relationship upon her during her student years. The complaint was filed three years after she left the institute and after the teacher’s engagement to another woman.A five-member committee constituted by MNNIT expressed reservations about adjudicating allegations of rape. Subsequently, a one-man inquiry commission headed by a retired judge was appointed.The petitioner admitted to having a relationship with the complainant, but maintained it was consensual and continued after she left the institute. On the basis of the report, the institute terminated his services on Feb 28, 2006.Challenging the termination, the lecturer contended that the disciplinary proceedings were vitiated by violation of principles of natural justice, particularly denial of the right to cross-examine witnesses. MNNIT authorities argued that a teacher occupies a position of trust and authority, and any intimate relationship with a student amounts to serious misconduct.The HC observed that the relationship appeared to be consensual and was not followed by any criminal action. It noted that the complaint appeared to have been triggered by the failure of a proposed marriage between the parties due to religious differences and parental opposition.","Allahabad high court sets aside 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train: Ready for New Year Launch from Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/made-in-bengaluru-vande-bharat-sleeper-set-for-new-year-rollout/articleshow/126126743.cms,"Made in Bengaluru: Vande Bharat Sleeper set for New Year rollout?

Is Vande Bharat sleeper better than Rajdhani Express?

BENGALURU: India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, Vande Bharat Sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout. Manufactured in Bengaluru by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), the train's second rake was recently dispatched to Indian Railways Contrary to speculations, the rake is still in Bengaluru and arrived at SMVT railway station Monday morning. A senior official from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai stated, ""The second rake of Vande Bharat Sleeper has come out of BEML and is still at SMVT station. It will likely remain there for another two or three days.""Vande Bharat Sleeper is designed for long-distance journeys exceeding 800–1,000km. Like the existing chair-car versions, this variant is engineered for a potential speed of 160 km/h, with quick acceleration and deceleration. However, the actual running speed will depend on the track infrastructure available on the route, as only a small portion of India's rail network can support speeds above 150 km/h.The rake spotted in Bengaluru consists of 16 coaches divided into three categories: third A/C, second A/C, and first A/C, similar to other air-conditioned rakes. Although the route for the initial commercial service has yet to be confirmed, it will be operated by Northern Railway zone which covers key cities such as Delhi, Ambala, Moradabad, Kanpur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur, across Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.As this rake is the first of its kind, there are some minor issues to resolve before clearance is granted. While the possibility of another trial run has not been ruled out, a decision has not yet been made. Eight more are planned, with a deadline set for March 2026. This initial batch of 10 rakes will be adequate to operate five sleeper services.Officials have acknowledged that minor technical modifications will be made in future rakes. ""We are identifying some minor rectification work, but we will implement that in the next rake. There are no issues with the aesthetics or design; the first two rakes are ready to operate without problems.""Once all formalities are complete, the rake will be transferred to Northern Railway. While Railway Board has yet to announce the details of the first commercial service, officials believe it might serve as a ‘New Year gift', with serious planning already under way.","India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, Vande Bharat Sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout.

The significantly higher bid has intensified concerns over the project's financial viability and long-term burden on citizens.Responding to these concerns, deputy chief minister and Bengaluru development minister DK Shivakumar said the govt's financial commitment will be capped at 40% of the project cost as estimated by the state. ""Beyond that, investment has to be made by private players. That is why the project is being taken up on build-operate-transfer basis,"" he said.He said he had reviewed Metro projects undertaken by BMRCL and tunnel projects in Mumbai, where costs are around Rs 1,200 crore per km. ""What has been quoted for this project will have to be examined,"" the DCM said.The project was tendered in two packages. Sources in Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) said Adani Group's bid overshoots the govt estimate by 24% for package 1 and 28% for package 2, gaps that are likely to require cabinet-level scrutiny before any award decision is made.The Hyderabad-based Vishwa Samudra Engineering Ltd was the only other firm to qualify for the financial bidding stage. Of the four firms that initially submitted bids, Dilip Buildcon was disqualified under a tender clause barring companies with a history of bridge, flyover or tunnel collapses, while Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd withdrew after its joint venture partner failed to meet technical eligibility criteria.The opposition BJP has demanded that the govt drop the tunnel project. BJP MP from Bengaluru Central PC Mohan cautioned that major tunnelling firms had stayed away from the tender, highlighting a poor risk–reward balance under the BOT model, where private concessionaires fund 60% of the cost and recover their investment through tolls. Mohan also pointed to limited soil testing and traffic data as factors that could drive further cost escalation once construction begins.Mobility experts who have been critical of the project said the Rs 22,267-crore cost quoted could eventually increase sharply, with construction stretching over a decade. Under BOT framework, toll recovery by private concessionaires could force commuters to bear both tolls and taxes for decades.","Adani Group has emerged as the lowest bidder for the proposed 17km tunnel road project.

Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif Omar bin Hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

‘Indian passport no longer adds value to my life’: Tech educator frustrated over visa hurdles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/indian-passport-no-longer-adds-value-to-my-life-tech-educator-frustrated-over-visa-hurdles/articleshow/126147854.cms,"India’s Silent Exodus: Over Two Lakh Indian Citizens Quit Passports Yearly Amid Changing Aspirations





Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport while working globally. In a viral post on X, Kushwaha described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plansAfter a recent trip to Berlin, Kushwaha said he was unable to travel to Ireland to surprise his best friend on his birthday because there was not enough time to apply for another visa. What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport.

""We Are Not Safe..."" Unnao Rape Victim’s Mother Manhandled, Protest Stopped

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation will approach the Supreme Court at the earliest to challenge the Delhi High Court order that suspended the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case, officials said on Wednesday.The decision was taken after the agency examined the order passed by a division bench of the Delhi High Court.According to news agency PTI, a CBI spokesperson said it has been decided to file a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the ruling that put Sengar’s life sentence on hold during the pendency of his appeal.Despite the bail order, Sengar will continue to remain behind bars as he is separately serving a 10-year jail term in another case linked to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father, officials clarified.Sengar had approached the Delhi High Court challenging the life sentence awarded to him by a trial court in December 2019.The appeal was strongly opposed by both the CBI and the victim’s family, who raised concerns over safety and alleged threats.The agency said it had filed timely replies and written submissions, while the survivor’s family also opposed the plea on security grounds, reported PTI.On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court suspended Sengar’s sentence, noting that he had already spent around seven years and five months in prison.The suspension will remain in force until his appeal against conviction and sentence is decided.Granting bail, the court imposed strict conditions, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount.The court also directed Sengar not to enter a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi and restrained him from issuing any threats to her or her mother. Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping the girl in 2017, when she was a minor.The rape case and related matters were shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi in August 2019 on the directions of the Supreme Court.The high court order has triggered strong reactions from the survivor, who described the suspension of Sengar’s sentence as “kaal” or death for her family, reported PTI.She said she would also approach the Supreme Court to seek justice, arguing that such decisions deepen fear among survivors of sexual violence.The survivor and her mother staged a protest in the national capital and later met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, seeking support in their legal battle.She alleged that security for her family and legal team had already been withdrawn and claimed that the court’s decision had further heightened concerns for their safety, according to PTI.As the legal battle moves to the Supreme Court, the CBI has said it will press for the high court order to be set aside, reiterating its stand that the conviction and sentence awarded in the Unnao rape case must remain in force.",CBI to move Supreme Court against Delhi high court order in Unnao rape case.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre’s directions to states to impose a ban on granting new mining leases in the Aravalli range, calling it a “bogus attempt at damage control that will not fool anybody”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the Aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out,” he said in a post on X.On Wednesday, the Union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, describing it as a major step toward the “conservation and protection.” The directive aims to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the NCR and to end unregulated mining across the region.The Centre’s order came after a public row over its new definition of the Aravallis, which classifies an “Aravalli Hill” as a landform with an elevation of at least 100 metres above its surrounding terrain, and an “Aravalli Range” as a cluster of two or more such hills within 500 metres of each other.However, the former Union environment minister dismissed the move as insufficient, arguing that the core issue remains unaddressed. “These are pious proclamations but the dangerous 100m+ redefinition of the Aravallis -- rejected by the Forest Survey of India, the Supreme Court-mandated Central Empowered Committee, and the Supreme Court's amicus curiae -- remains unchanged,” said Ramesh.He has repeatedly said that the redefinition being adopted by the Centre has been opposed by the Forest Survey of India, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court, and the apex court’s amicus curiae.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre rejected the charge that the new definition weakens environmental safeguards, maintaining that more than 90 per cent of the Aravalli region remains protected and that the revised definition does not relax mining controls, reported PTI.In an earlier post, Ramesh had accused the government of misleading the public on the issue. “It is by now abundantly clear that the Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change is being economical with the truth on the Aravallis issue and is misleading the public,” he said.He also questioned why the PM Modi-led government is pushing through what he described as a “fatally flawed” redefinition of the Aravallis despite widespread expert opposition.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the Aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out” On Wednesday, the Union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravalli range.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126163749,imgsize-762827,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-33.jpg"

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR and adjoining areas on Wednesday lifted GRAP-IV with immediate effect, even though air quality across large parts of the city remained in the ‘very poor’ category.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), areas such as ITO and India Gate recorded AQI levels crossing 350, underscoring the persistence of hazardous air conditions in the national capital.The CAQM said the decision was taken to revoke its order dated December 13, 2025, which had invoked actions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).GRAP Stage IV is enforced when air quality reaches the ‘severe+’ category with an AQI above 450. The commission, however, clarified that measures under Stage I, Stage II and Stage III of the extant GRAP will continue and will be implemented as per the modified GRAP dated November 21, 2025.The easing of curbs came hours after the Delhi High Court directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering GST on air purifiers in view of the worsening air quality.During the hearing, the court questioned the Centre over 18% GST imposed on air purifiers.At the outset, the bench expressed displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air.Earlier, GRAP Stage-IV measures had been enforced across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels. Under Stage IV, private vehicle movement was not completely banned, with restrictions largely dependent on emission norms and fuel type. While vehicles meeting prescribed standards were allowed to operate, older vehicles face stricter curbs. BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles are not permitted to ply in Delhi-NCR during this phase, except those providing essential services.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) lifted GRAP-IV with immediate effect.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday ordered states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, a major move amid public outcry over the ""new definition"" of the mountain range.The Union environment ministry said the decision was aimed at the ""conservation and protection"" of one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, covering the stretch from Delhi to Gujarat. The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region and to put an end to unregulated mining across the region.As part of the announcement, the ministry instructed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify further zones across the Aravallis where mining must be prohibited, beyond those areas already notified by the Centre-based on ecological, geological and landscape-level assessments.The Centre also said it intends to expand the list of areas protected and restricted from mining across the range. For mines that are currently operational, state governments have been asked to ensure ""strict compliance"" with environmental safeguards and adherence to Supreme Court orders.On Monday, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said at a press conference that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Responding to the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of the Aravallis, he said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He further underlined the government’s efforts such as the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and global recognition of India’s forest cover, adding that the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".The Supreme Court's acceptance, classifying any landform in Aravalli districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief as Aravali Hills-sparked concern among several stakeholders, who fear the new definition could leave more than 90% of the range open to mining, as most landforms fall below the 100-metre threshold.","The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. In earlier missions, it has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites.","Isro released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis.

From Work-From-Home To Vehicle Ban- Delhi Rolls Out Fresh Pollution Curbs

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of GST on air purifiers in view of worsening air quality.During the hearing the court questioned the Centre over the imposition of 18% GST on air purifiers.At the outset of the hearing, the bench voiced its displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air, PTI reported.“Let the purifiers be provided. That’s the minimum you can do. When will you come back?…. Even if it is for temporary, give exemption for next one week or one month… Consider this an emergency situation, only for temporarily. Take instructions and come back,” the bench said.“We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance. As we speak, we all breathe. You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day. Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that’s involuntary,” the bench added.""We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance. As we speak, we all breathe. You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day.Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that's involuntary,"" it further added.In the post-lunch session, the counsel council for the government submitted that the issue fell within the policy domain of the GST Council, a body comprising representatives of all states and the Union, and that any meeting must be convened by the Union finance minister, who chairs the council.""This is a policy decision to be taken by GST council. It comprises of members of all States and Union. The meeting has to be called by the union finance minister who heads the council,"" the counsel submitted.Acknowledging that the GST Council is a pan-India body and that convening a meeting may take time, the bench citing the severe air quality in Delhi and adjoining regions, directed that the council meet at the earliest and issued notice to the Centre on the petition.""However, taking into consideration the air quality situation in the state of Delhi and nearby areas, we find it appropriate to require the council to meet at the earliest,"" the bench added and issued notice to the Centre on the petition, as reported by PTI.The plea said that levying GST at the highest slab on air purifiers, now essential for ensuring minimally safe indoor air, makes them unaffordable for large sections of the population.“Imposition of GST at the highest slab upon air-purifiers, a device that has become indispensable for securing minimally safe indoor air, renders such equipment financially inaccessible to large segments of the population and thereby inflicts an arbitrary, unreasonable, and constitutionally impermissible burden,” the plea said.The hearing comes as Delhi continues to choke under toxic smog. Parts of the city, including ITO and India Gate, recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, with AQI levels crossing 350, according to CPCB data. GRAP Stage-IV measures have been enforced across Delhi-NCR.","The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of GST on air purifiers.

NEW DELHI: The Unnao rape case survivor on Wednesday said that Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s bail and the Delhi high court decision is like “kaal (death)” for her family and said she will challenge the order in the Supreme Court.""HC decision like 'kaal (death)' for us, will challenge order in SC,"" the survivor told news agency PTI after Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case.Delhi high court granted bail to Sengar while suspending his life sentence, holding that he cannot be kept in jail only on the basis of the threat perception of the victim in the Unnao rape case.While allowing Sengar’s application under Section 389 of the CrPC, the court said, “Kuldeep Singh Sengar can’t be kept in jail only because of the threat perception of the victim in Unnao Rape case,” and added that courts cannot deny bail merely out of apprehension that security agencies may fail in their duty.""At the same time, however, the argument of keeping the appellant (Sengar) in custody because of threat perception to the victim/ survivor, in the opinion of this court, is not a tenable argument to deny the benefit of section 389 CrPC to the appellant,"" the bench said in its 53-page verdict.The bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar observed that such an approach would undermine the work of security forces. “Such an observation or such a thought process would undermine the laudable work of our police/paramilitary forces,” the court said.Suspending Sengar’s sentence till the pendency of his appeal against the December 2019 trial court verdict, the high court noted that he has already spent about seven years and five months in prison and that continued incarceration would violate Article 21 of the Constitution. The appeal has been listed before the roster bench on January 16, 2026, subject to orders of the chief justice.The court imposed several conditions while granting bail, directing Sengar to furnish a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount. It ordered that all three sureties must be residents of Delhi and directed Sengar to stay in the national capital during the pendency of his appeal. He was also asked to deposit his passport with the trial court and to report to the local police station every Monday at 10 am.Sengar has been barred from entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence and from threatening or contacting her or her mother. “Violation of any of the conditions would lead to cancellation of bail,” the high court said. The court also said he should remain available to complete the remaining part of the sentence if found guilty.On the safety of the survivor, the court said it expects that she will continue to get CRPF cover and directed the deputy commissioner of police of the area where she is residing to personally ensure and supervise her protection during the pendency of the appeal.“The state is also providing for the accommodation of the victim. The Delhi Commission for Women is responsible for ensuring that the victim is provided sufficient accommodation and such arrangement is directed to be continued till further orders,” the bench said, adding that the survivor is free to approach the court if required.The high court noted that the Supreme Court had earlier transferred the trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi keeping in mind the survivor’s vulnerability and the custodial death of her father, for which Sengar has been convicted.Despite the suspension of sentence in the rape case, Sengar will continue to remain in jail as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the survivor’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter. His appeal in the custodial death case, in which he has sought suspension of sentence, is also pending.Reacting to the order, the survivor told PTI that she was not satisfied with the verdict.“I have small children. There is an elderly, differently-abled mother-in-law and my husband at home. The safety of my children is the biggest concern,” she said.She alleged lapses during the trial and withdrawal of security cover. “Usually, a verdict is pronounced within two or three days after the conclusion of arguments. But in this case, the decision came after three months. Even before the verdict, security for the family and witnesses was withdrawn,” she alleged.The survivor further said, “In the serious crime where my father was murdered and I was subjected to rape, the accused is granted bail after serving a few years in prison. This raises the question of what kind of justice this is.”Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping a minor in 2017. The rape case and other connected matters were transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019.",Delhi high court granted bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar while suspending his life sentence. Court said he cannot be kept in jail only on the basis of the threat perception of the victim in the Unnao rape case.

Security forces attacked, senior officers injured

Land rights and Sixth Schedule at the core

Hunger strike, misinformation triggered violence

Talks announced, arson continues

Internet suspended to prevent escalation

CM monitors situation, appeals for calm

NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region enter third day.

Assam’s Karbi Anglong Gripped By Violence, Internet Suspended As Anger Over ‘Encroachers’ Explodes

NEW DELHI: Assam DGP Harmeet Singh on Wednesday confirmed that the Army has been deployed to restore law and order in violence-hit West Karbi Anglong, news agency PTI reported.The region has now entered its third day of violent protests over alleged illegal settlement by non-tribals in the constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill area. The clashes have left two people dead and dozens injured. In response, the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led government has imposed curfew-like restrictions and suspended mobile internet services in two districts to control the situation.Assam CM Himanta said the Karbi people's demand to evict alleged Hindi-speaking encroachers from grazing lands cannot be acted upon immediately, as the matter is currently under a stay order issued by the Gauhati high court.The violence in West Karbi Anglong and the neighbouring Karbi Anglong district began after long-standing tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. Police said one tribal protester died during police action, while a non-tribal man was killed in a fire that destroyed several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has now become the centre of the unrest.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said that 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured when protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces.Both the DGP and IGP (Law and Order) Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those hurt. According to police, the protesters tried to take control of a bridge, and the situation turned violent when security forces stopped them.“They tried to take over the bridge, and when we intervened, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was hit with bows and arrows,” the DGP said. He added that police have video evidence and will take legal action against the attackers.The protests stem from claims by the Karbi community that non-tribal settlers have illegally encroached on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday criticised the forcible removal of the Unnao rape survivor by security forces from India Gate, where she was protesting against the Delhi high court ’s order suspending the life sentence of the convict and former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar""Is such treatment of a gang rape survivor appropriate? Is her 'fault' that she has the courage to raise her voice for justice?"" Gandhi wrote on X.The Congress leader described the high court’s bail to Sengar as ""disappointing"" and ""shameful."" Sengar committed the crime in June 2017 and was convicted in December 2019, months after the Supreme Court shifted the trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.“Bail for rapists and treating survivors like criminals—what kind of justice is this?"" Gandhi asked.He added that India is not only a ""dead economy"" but is also becoming a ""dead society.” This was a reference to his earlier remark endorsing US President Donald Trump’s jibe at India and Russia.""In a democracy, raising a voice of dissent is a right, and suppressing it is a crime. The survivor deserves respect, safety, and justice—not helplessness, fear, and injustice,"" the Raebareli MP said.The high court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to Sengar and suspended his life sentence in the Unnao rape case for the duration of the pendency of his appeal challenging his conviction and sentencing.The conditions of his bail include furnishing a Rs 15-lakh personal bond with three sureties of the same amount, not entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence, and refraining from threatening or influencing her or her mother.","Rahul Gandhi criticises forcible removal of Unnao rape survivor by security forces from India Gate.

Tuberculosis: What are the causes, symptoms in adults and in children

NEW DELHI: India has recorded steep declines in malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child deaths, signalling what the government calls a decisive, results-driven phase in the country’s public-health journey.Addressing the Advancing Public Health Outcomes Forum 2025 on Wednesday, Union health minister JP Nadda said the gains were based on sustained political commitment, strong scientific capacity and people’s participation, rather than isolated programmes.“Disease control and immunisation outcomes today are the result of institutional strength and Jan Bhagidari,” he said.Incidence of malaria has dropped by over 80%, with deaths down 78%, shifting India from a high-burden to a high-impact phase.Incidence of tuberculosis has fallen from 237 cases per lakh population in 2015 to 187 per lakh — a 21% decline, nearly double the global average. Maternal mortality has reduced from 130 per lakh live births in 2014 to 88 in 2025, while infant mortality has declined from 39 to 27 per 1,000 live births.Under-five and neonatal mortality rates have also fallen far faster in India than globally.At the forum, four national reports reviewed progress on malaria, tuberculosis, lymphatic filariasis and immunisation.While they show that sustained programmes have sharply reduced the disease burden across most regions, they warn that the final phase of elimination will be the most demanding.The malaria assessment found transmission persisting in tribal, forested and hard-to-reach areas, with emerging risks in some urban pockets.As cases fall, experts cautioned that asymptomatic infections could be missed unless surveillance remains strong.The lymphatic filariasis report flagged gaps in post-treatment districts, especially in urban slums, industrial belts and migrant settlements. Uneven drug uptake, weak follow-up and limited morbidity care could threaten the 2027 elimination target despite years of mass drug administration.On tuberculosis, expanded diagnostics, digital tracking & newer regimens have improved outcomes, but poverty, malnutrition, migration and co-morbidities continue to drive transmission. Disruptions in care for migrants & the growing burden of post-TB lung disease among survivors were highlighted as major concerns.The immunisation assessment pointed to strong childhood coverage but warned of problems beyond early life—gaps in adolescent and adult vaccination, data inconsistencies and the absence of a life-course immunisation strategy.Strengthening primary healthcare remains central to the government’s approach. Nadda reiterated the goal of one Ayushman Arogya Mandir for every 2,000 people, noting that over 30,000 centres have already achieved national quality certification.","India has recorded steep declines in malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child deaths.

Yunus Govt Takes Responsibility Of Dipu Das Family After India Erupts Over Hindu Man's Lynching

KOLKATA: Tabla player Mainak Biswas and photographer Kallab Ghosh, who accompanied Sarod player Shiraz Ali Khan for his December 19 concert at Chhayanaut in Bangladesh, found themselves in a precarious situation in Dhaka after the event was cancelled.Recounting 48 hours of intense anxiety they endured before finally managing to return home on December 22, Biswas said he had never felt so vulnerable in the neighbouring country, which he has earlier visited at least five times. He said he had always received warmth from the people of Bangladesh.“However, this visit turned into my worst nightmare. I could never have imagined how difficult life could become as a Hindu trapped in Bangladesh when anti-Indian rhetoric was at its peak,” said Biswas after his return to Kolkata.The tension, he said, was suffocating, and every moment was spent in anticipation of what could go wrong. “It is easy to identify me as an Indian. Hence, the fear of being targeted was ever-present. The ordeal is a constant reminder of the vulnerability.”“My mother and grandmother were at home in Kolkata. But I didn’t call them up to share my tension. I still feel a shiver down my spine when I recall those helpless hours,” Biswas recounted.“I had switched off my phone. My mind went blank when I learned what had happened to Dipu Das. I couldn’t fathom what might await me if a mob attacked me.”The situation became increasingly challenging after Shiraz’s departure. “He had reputation of a renowned musician and the advantage of a Khan surname. Unlike him, I couldn’t even speak local dialect. They say those who can’t speak have no enemies. I decided to remain silent and pretend I couldn’t speak. Shiraz’s mother was with us, and I had the added responsibility of ensuring her safety,” Biswas said.","Tabla player Mainak Biswas and photographer Kallab Ghosh found themselves in a precarious situation in Dhaka after the event was cancelled.

India Faces Global Safety Alert As WHO Warns Over 3 Toxic Cough Syrups After 19 Children Die In MP

BHOPAL: ""My son survived, but he returned to me without his sight,"" said Tikku Yaduvanshi (36), his voice breaking as he recalled the 116 days his five-year-old son had battled for life after consuming the toxic cough syrup Coldrif in Parasia town, in MP's Chhindwara district.""He cannot see, he cannot walk properly, and I cannot leave him even for a moment. How do I go back to work now?"" Tikku said.The boy is among the few children to survive the killer cough syrup tragedy that claimed the lives of 26 children across Chhindwara and Betul districts.After more than four months of hospitalisation across multiple cities, he was finally discharged from AIIMS Nagpur on Monday night - alive, but with severe, and possibly irreversible, damage.For Tikku, a former employee of a private finance company, survival has come at an unbearable cost. He has not received a salary for the past four months, defaulted on housing loan EMIs, sold his cattle, and mortgaged his wife's jewellery to fund treatment and sustain his family during the prolonged hospital stay in Nagpur.""We were four people staying there - my wife, two other family members and I - paying for food, rooms, everything, while our child was fighting for life.Govts and officials might come and go, what we have lived through in these four months cannot be put into words,"" Tikku said.His son's ordeal began on August 24, when Tikku first took him to paediatrician Dr Praveen Soni in Parasia. Two days later, as complications developed, he returned to the doctor.On September 1, Kunal was rushed to Nagpur and admitted to a private hospital. As his condition worsened, he was shifted to AIIMS Nagpur on September 11, where treatment continued for over three months. While the state govt has assured financial assistance towards medical expenses, Tikku said it barely scratches the surface. ""Whatever money we receive will go into repaying the loans we took for his treatment. It does not cover our stay, food, or the debts we piled up just to keep him alive,"" he said.Complete recovery remains uncertain. Doctors have not been able to say whether his son's vision will return.""I want the govt to tell me - will it bear the cost of his future treatment,"" he asked. ""I have heard there are better facilities for eyesight treatment in Chennai. My child did nothing wrong. At least give him a chance,"" he added. The Coldrif syrup tragedy has led to arrests, suspensions, and an SIT probe.Paediatrician Dr Praveen Soni, his wife Jyoti Soni, and the manufacturers of the syrup - Tamil Nadu-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals - have been named as accused. Yet, for families like these, accountability offers little comfort. ""My son survived death. Now we are just praying he can see the world one day, and that we are not left alone to fight this battle,"" Tikku said.","Five-year-old Kunal Yaduvanshi survived the killer cough syrup tragedy that claimed the lives of 26 children across Chhindwara and Betul districts.

KOLKATA: Foreign courts can hear divorce and maintenance proceedings of a marriage solemnised in India if one of the spouses resides in that country, the Calcutta high court has said while setting aside a lower court order putting an injunction on a UK district court order in favour of the wife.In its December 15 ruling, a division bench of justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that under the Hindu Marriage Act, it is specified a petition can be heard by ""district court with the local limits"" of the residence where a couple last resided.The bench clarified that though under a different section of the same law, ""district court"" means Indian courts and not foreign courts, ""taken in its true spirit and in a liberal perspective"", the UK family court can have jurisdiction if prima facie the wife resides there and at least ""the parties last resided together as spouses in the UK.""""It cannot be said outright that the judgment which might ultimately be passed in the divorce suit of the wife in the UK would be inconclusive in India,"" the judges said.The couple got married in Kolkata on December 15, 2018. The husband first filed for divorce on Sept 4, 2024, at Alipore court. On October 10, 2024, the wife moved the UK court for divorce and the next day for maintenance. She said she had been residing in the UK since 2015 on student and work visas with occasional visits to India and they last stayed as a married couple in the UK.On May 16, 2025, the UK family court directed the husband to pay maintenance. However, on Nov 1, Alipore district court put an injunction on that order saying the wife cannot proceed with her case in the UK.The Alipore court reasoned that the husband had moved the divorce suit first and held that the UK court had no jurisdiction in the case as the wife was not a permanent resident of the country. It said the maintenance amount granted by the UK court was ""onerous and oppressive"" as it exceeded the earnings of the husband.The woman challenged the order in the high court which heldeven if the pleas were filed by the wife later, the husband filed a response and adduced evidence in the UK court. ""Prima facie, it is not credible that the husband is not in a position to contest the wife's divorce proceedings and alimony application in UK"", the high court said.",Foreign courts can hear divorce and maintenance proceedings of a marriage solemnised in India if one of the spouses resides in that country.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.

Isro delivers its heaviest punch as Bahubali puts BlueBird into orbit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-delivers-its-heaviest-punch-as-bahubali-puts-bluebird-into-orbit/articleshow/126166767.cms,"Isro delivers its heaviest punch as Bahubali puts BlueBird into orbit

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

SRIHARIKOTA: Baahubali sent BlueBird to the heavens. India’s space ambitions gained new heights and heft. Isro capped 2025 with a flawless heavy-lift statement Wednesday, as its LVM3 rocket — nicknamed Baahubali — hurled the US communications satellite BlueBird Block-2 into low Earth orbit, the heaviest spacecraft ever launched from Indian soil.The lift-off came from the second launch pad at Sriharikota at 8.55 am, delayed by a minute to sidestep space debris. Fifteen minutes later, precision prevailed. The 6,100kg satellite was injected into a near-perfect circular orbit, marking another clean chapter for India’s human-rated launcher.The mission extended LVM3’s unbroken streak to nine consecutive successes — a milestone that sharpens confidence for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme and signals India’s arrival as a serious player in the global LEO communications market.Isro chairman V Narayanan called it a standout flight on multiple fronts. The launcher achieved orbital accuracy of less than 1.5km, placing BlueBird at 518.9km against a target of 520km — the best performance by an Indian rocket to date. “With nine consecutive successful LVM3 launches, our confidence in the Gaganyaan mission has significantly increased,” Narayanan said.Beyond mass and accuracy, the launch carried historical weight.It marked Isro’s 434th satellite deployment for 34 countries across 45 years, and the first back-to-back LVM3 mission, executed with a turnaround of just 52 days.Technological upgrades pushed the rocket further. Payload capability rose by more than 150kg after electro-hydraulic actuators were replaced with electro-mechanical systems to control the massive S200 booster motors. “With additional technologies, we have demonstrated that Isro is in a much better position for future missions, including Gaganyaan,” said mission director T Victor Joseph.The flight underscored rising commercial momentum. P Mohan, acting chairman and MD of Isro’s commercial arm NewSpace India Ltd, said interest in the launcher is accelerating. “There is interest for six to 10 LVM3 missions annually, with several global companies seeking up to six launches per year from 2026–27 onwards,” he said.Wednesday’s mission, designated LVM3-M6, was flown under a commercial agreement between NSIL and US-based AST & Science LLC. BlueBird Block-2 forms part of a global LEO constellation designed to deliver direct-to-mobile 4G and 5G connectivity.Shanti Gupta, chief operating officer of AST SpaceMobile, said the company aims to deploy 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026 for worldwide coverage and is in talks with space agencies across the globe, including Isro.Industry voices framed the launch as a strategic inflection point. Space Industry Association of India president Subba Rao said India now stands among a select group capable of reliably deploying heavy-class LEO payloads for next-generation telecom networks.“Its significance lies not just in launch success, but in what it signals about India’s industrial readiness, reliability, and ability to support constellations at scale over time,” he said.Indian Space Association director general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt described the mission as a quantum leap. “It exemplifies Isro’s engineering excellence and operational maturity, enabling heavier payloads for global satellite constellations,” he said.“The mission strengthens India’s self-reliance in launch services and positions Isro as a preferred provider for international missions, while accelerating growth across the domestic space ecosystem.”As Baahubali faded into the morning sky, the message lingered on Earth: India is no longer testing the limits of heavy lift — it is defining them.","Isro caps 2025 with flawless heavy-lift statement as its LVM3 rocket hurled the US communications satellite BlueBird Block-2 into low Earth orbit.

Pakistan Using Drones To Smuggle Arms Into India, Punjab Police Busts Network, Recover Huge Cache

CHANDIGARH: Coming down heavily on Punjab Police over the murder of a kabaddi player in public view, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the DGP to appear in person and explain why adequate security arrangements were not made at the stadium, where nearly a thousand spectators had gathered.The DGP has been asked to explain what steps are being taken to curb organised crime in the state and to prevent such incidents in the future.""Criminals armed with pistols entering a stadium, firing several shots and escaping in the presence of a thousand spectators and scores of policemen on duty, indicates that the criminals had a free run. There have been several other instances of targeted killings, some of which have been captured in CCTV footage. It is, therefore, manifest that criminals are operating with impunity, which raises serious questions regarding the law and order situation in the state,"" observed the division bench of Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal.Justice Grewal also asked the DGP why the culprits (the two shooters) managed to escape and have not been nabbed yet, and directed him to submit the duty roster of police officials who were deployed at the stadium on that date.""It has come to our notice that on Dec 15, a few criminals shot dead a former kabaddi player during a match in a stadium in Sector-79, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The match was telecast live and CCTV footage indicates that several shots were fired by two persons in the presence of about a thousand spectators. It appears no effort was made by any police officer to apprehend the culprits, which is deplorable,"" observed the bench.During the hearing on Wednesday, the state counsel, on the instructions from SP (investigation) Saurav Jindal, submitted that the two shooters have been identified and efforts are on to nab them. Five other criminals associated with the crime have been arrested.In its order, the bench observed that it had on Dec 23, 2023, expressed grave concern over the telecast of an interview of a criminal (Lawrence Bishnoi) glorifying crime and criminals. It had the tendency to influence young impressionable minds, the court noted with concern.""We had, therefore, directed the Punjab DGP to file an affidavit on whether there has been any spurt in crime, including extortion and targeted killings, after the telecast of the interview. He filed the affidavit mentioning details of such incidents. In response to the order of this court dated July 16, 2025, on what steps are being taken to combat the menace of extortion calls, organized crime, targeted killings etc. , the DGP filed an affidavit dated August 26 setting out the measures taken by police to combat the menace,"" the high court recorded in its order, and fixed the next hearing on January 15.",The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the DGP to appear in person and explain why adequate security arrangements were not made at the stadium.

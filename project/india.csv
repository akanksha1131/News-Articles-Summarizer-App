It is with a heavy heart that I write this tribute to Bhaskar Das , a remarkable individual whose life was a shining example of humility, kindness, and boundless curiosity. His passing has left a void that words cannot fill, but his legacy will continue to inspire all those fortunate enough to have known him.Just a few days ago, Malcolm Raphael , my friend and one of BD’s ex-TOI colleagues, and I visited BD’s home to hand over the prasad from a special Mritunjaya Homam that I had arranged at Sri Ayyappa Sangham temple for his well-being.Shoma, his gracious wife, accepted it on his behalf as BD was under heavy sedation due to the pain of his advanced cancer. As much as I wanted to see him, part of me felt relieved. It would have been heartwrenching to see the vibrant, energetic BD I had known for over 25 years in that fragile state.This photo, taken by Impact, 13 years ago, perfectly captures the BD I admired—a man full of life, always eager to learn, and deeply committed to helping others. When I was starting out as a young media planner and buyer, the Times of India was a mighty force in the industry, and BD held a senior position within its ranks. Yet, despite his stature, he was always willing to guide and support me without a second thought about titles or hierarchies. That generosity became the first strategic pillar of our long and meaningful relationship.Even when I ventured into entrepreneurship, BD’s humility and curiosity stood out. I remember a conversation where he expressed a desire to be part of the projects we were working on—not for personal gain, but simply to learn and grow. That was the essence of BD: a man who believed that life’s greatest wealth lay in knowledge, relationships, and contribution.Shoma shared with me that even as recently as January 6th, BD was writing work notes, determined to stay connected to his passion. His ambition to work until his last breath speaks volumes about his dedication and purpose. At 72, BD lived a life that Shoma described as “worthy of celebration.” It’s a sentiment I deeply resonate with.Beyond his professional achievements, what made BD truly extraordinary was his ability to connect with people. He listened intently, shared generously, and left a lasting impression on everyone he met. He showed us that leadership is not about power but about empowering others, and that success is not measured by accolades but by the lives you touch.As I reflect on his life, I’m struck by the profound lessons it holds for all of us. BD reminds us to embrace life with purpose, to remain curious no matter how much we’ve achieved, and to find joy in the journey. His story is a testament to the fact that a life lived with humility, grace, and intention can leave an impact far greater than we can imagine.Though BD is no longer with us, his spirit endures in the memories and hearts of those who loved and respected him. Let us honor his memory by striving to embody the values he stood for: humility, kindness, lifelong learning, and a commitment to uplifting those around us.Rest in peace, Bhaskar Da. You will be deeply missed, but your legacy will live on, inspiring us to live fuller, more meaningful lives.","Bhaskar Das was a remarkable individual whose life was a shining example of humility, kindness, and boundless curiosity.

Cabinet okays Rs 4k cr third launchpad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-okays-rs-4k-cr-third-launchpad/articleshow/117312793.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro said Thursday it received the green light for the construction of a third launch pad (TLP) at its Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, from the Union Cabinet led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The project, estimated to cost Rs 3,984.8 crore, is set to enhance India's space launch capabilities and support future human spaceflight missions.The new facility is designed with versatility in mind, capable of supporting both Next Generation Launch Vehicles (NGLV) and LVM3 vehicles with semicryogenic stages.This strategic expansion comes as India sets its sights on ambitious space goals, including establishing its own space station by 2035 and achieving a crewed lunar landing by 2040.""The TLP will be developed with maximum industry participation, leveraging Isro's extensive experience from previous launch pad establishments,"" a govt statement read. The project is scheduled for completion within 48 months.TOI first reported about the TLP in October 2024. In an exclusive interview with TOI, then Isro chairman S Somanath said: ""We only have the second launch pad now. The first one was created for PSLV, but it can't be used for GSLV as it cannot handle the cryogenic stage. When LVM-3 came, we re-engineered the second launch pad. Now, LVM-3 will also have a semi-cryo stage, and the human spaceflight initially has to happen there.""Pointing out that the second launch pad has been undergoing several improvements in the past two decades, Somanath said in case something happens to the second launch pad - an explosion, for instance - there won't be a launch pad available for GSLV, and every programme will come to a standstill.""The primary objective of the third launch pad is to serve as a redundancy. Next is that we are moving to a new philosophy with the NGLV (New Generation Launch Vehicle); it is going to be integrated horizontally and tilted, not vertically. The launch pad must support this aspect. NGLV will be more liquid engine booster-based than solid engine, so the entire launch pad jet deflector design will change. Also, the entire stage testing will happen here and not at Mahendragiri. The launch pad will cater to all of this,"" Somanath said.","The third launch pad will be built at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.

Isro's SpaDeX op success stepping stone for India’s ambitious space missions: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isros-spadex-op-success-stepping-stone-for-indias-ambitious-space-missions-pm-modi/articleshow/117312695.cms,"NEW DELHI: The successful docking of two Isro spacecraft in space on Thursday has paved the way for future space and outer space missions as India desperately needs a permanent station in space for parking its spacecraft before pursuing a long space journey.The docking mission is a very challenging task as it involves reducing the inter-spacecraft distance between two fast-moving satellites till they unite.Though Chaser and Target satellites have been moving at a speed of 28,800 kmph or 10 times the speed of a bullet in space, they appear to be stationary due to zero relative velocity. Chaser then approached Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking.Only three countries — the US, Russia and China — have mastered this technology until now. India has now entered this elite club, becoming the fourth country to achieve this remarkable feat.Isro scientists started work on the space docking experiment (SpaDeX) in 2016 with preliminary studies and hastened the work on the technology when PM Narendra Modi in 2023 had set deadlines for the indigenous space station by 2035 and manned mission to the Moon by 2040. On Thursday, the scientists were overjoyed when Chaser and Target, both weighing 220kg, docked in space after initial hiccups.Lauding Isro scientists, the PM said the SpaDeX mission is a “significant stepping stone for India’s ambitious space missions in the years to come”.“Congratulations to our scientists at @isro and the entire space fraternity for the successful demonstration of space docking of satellites,” he said on X. President Droupadi Murmu also congratulated Isro for the mission.Space minister Jitendra Singh underscored that SpaDeX establishes India as a global leader in space docking technology. He also highlighted a significant collaboration between the Department of Biotechnology and Isro to explore the application of biology in space.Singh also highlighted the significance of the indigenous ‘ Bharatiya Docking System ’ used for the docking experiment and emphasised that this milestone paved way for smooth conduct of ambitious future missions, including Bharatiya Antriksha Station, Chandrayaan-4 and Gaganyaan .”PM Sh@narendramodi’s continuous patronage keeps the spirits soaring...,” he posted on X.Isro veteran Nambi Narayanan said, “It is something we all have been dreaming of for years. In every future mission, we will need to do docking for outer space missions. We have to perfect it. We have to be a master of the technology. It appears that we have become one since we achieved it gradually.” Former Isro scientist and Chandrayaan-1 project director Mylswamy Annadurai said besides playing a vital role in future missions, the docking technology could play a crucial role in managing space debris.The primary objective of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous docking and undocking of two small spacecraft in a low-earth circular orbit. The objectives also include demonstration of the transfer of electric power between the docked spacecraft, which is essential for future applications such as in-space robotics, composite spacecraft control and payload operations after undocking.The Indian industry is also upbeat about the mission’s success. “It truly opens doors to many possibilities, from furtherance of our space programs to establishment of our own space station in future. It also brings endless opportunities much closer, especially when our private space industry is moving forward and growing rapidly,” says Lt Gen AK Bhatt, director general, Indian Space Association (ISpA).",The successful docking of two Isro spacecraft in space on Thursday has paved the way for future space and outer space missions. India desperately needs a permanent station in space for parking its spacecraft before pursuing a long space journey. The docking mission is a very challenging task as it involves reducing the inter-spacecraft distance between two fast-moving satellites.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117312694,imgsize-1377252,width-400,resizemode-4/117312694.jpg"

Additional details about the 8th Pay Commission, including its membership, will be announced by the government at a later date.The implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission led to substantial modifications in salary structures, allowances and pensions for central government employees, ensuring equitable compensation for both serving staff and retired personnel.The Central Pay Commissions are typically set up once every decade to evaluate and suggest modifications to pay scales, allowances and benefits for central government employees, considering various economic indicators including inflation.The 7th Pay Commission, which was established by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on February 28, 2014, delivered its findings on November 19, 2015, with the changes taking effect from January 1, 2016.Following this schedule, the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations would likely come into force from January 1, 2026. Similar to previous commissions, it is expected to bring revisions in salaries, including changes to Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners.","Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

"Pannun probe substantive, led to outcomes we desired: US envoy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-probe-substantive-led-to-outcomes-we-desired-us-envoy/articleshow/117307482.cms,"US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti. (Photo/PTI)

After the recent tensions over the Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder plot, the Biden administration looked to sign off on a positive note with India as outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti Thursday welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case, saying the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms .Garcetti told TOI in an interview that while the probe was not an end in itself, and the US would look forward to more steps, the outcome helped prove wrong the sceptics who believed there’s no way India and the United States would be able to navigate this issue and that what India was doing was mere “window dressing”.The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow, saying he saw Trump’s tariff focus as an invitation for dialogue on the issue, and not as a threat to start a trade war.“My assessment is it’s ( Pannun probe ) a really positive first step. We welcome it. It delivered what the private interactions I had with Indian officials promised. We said changes should be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again and people should be held accountable. It’s not the destination though. The report would be first to say that. It says it’s recommending a process for prosecution. And just like in our system, facts come out and things happen. But this is substantive. It moves the ball forward and we look forward to steps in the future,"" said Garcetti, when asked about the outcome of the probe which suggested the plot might have been a ‘lone wolf’ operation.On Canada’s ongoing probe into similar cases and alleged Indian involvement, which it has linked to higher-ups including the Indian home minister, Garcetti said he didn’t have any knowledge about it at all. “I believe both of our countries have independent criminal justice systems, which are outside our intelligence systems and have to pursue facts that can hold up in a court of law. I don’t want to speak for Canada. I know it to be the case in America. My friends in Canada would say they have a similar system. I think often we see connections that don’t exist,’’ said the ambassador.Garcetti said the fact that Trump has close ties with PM Narendra Modi and the fact that he has appointed people considered pro-India as NSA and secretary of state augurs well for ties. He described Biden as the most pro-India president in US history and Modi as the most pro-US PM. “And when President Biden said this is the most important country to me when he asked me to take this position…I think he proved it. Things like ICET, envisioning IMEEC…or the work we are doing in Fiji, or southeast Asia or Africa is not just additive but also multiplicative. That legacy will be an amazing foundation for the Trump administration to further build on but will also stand on it as the brightest chapter,’’ he said.Trade war doesn’t help anybody, said Garcetti when asked about Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on India and others. “If we want to outcompete our main competitors…want to have a China plus one strategy, It’s not enough to have good intentions. We have to reduce tariffs further. We have to create a corridor that is trusted between our technologies. The way I hear it from the president-elect, it’s an invitation to sit down at the table, not a threat to start a trade war,’’ he said.On the US focus on human rights, minorities and freedom of speech, Garcetti said both India and the US needed to guard against misinformation and to ensure a sense of belonging for all, but added US wasn’t looking to teach or preach. “That’s for the Indians to determine. India says we will not comment on you and please don’t comment on us. America says we are going to comment on you, please do comment on us. We have a slight difference there. There have been moments when I have been blown away by the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. There are fair, free elections that are an example for others,’’ he said.Asked about some of the most challenging issues he faced during his tenure, including India’s ties with Russia and the murder-for-hire case, Garcetti said there was nothing the 2 sides could not overcome even though there were conversations that weren’t easy. “Sometimes we have to disagree on things. But we resolved our trade disputes. We are navigating through criminal cases – both what happened to Indian diplomats in San Francisco and in terms of what happened to American citizens like in the Pannun case. Democracies are complex, diverse populations are difficult to manage but it reminds me of America a few decades ago. If we put our minds together, there’s nothing we can’t do,’’ he said.","Outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case. Garcetti said the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms. The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117307885,imgsize-890992,width-400,resizemode-4/117307885.jpg"

Paradise to peril

Coastal crisis deepens

Beachcombing was synonymous with Sujith's childhood in the sun-kissed shores of Shankumugham in Thiruvananthapuram. The beach was a magnet for family gatherings for shindigs on a sprawling stretch of ochre sand. The Indian Coffee House was an added bonus.The lapping of waves against Kerala 's sandy shores once promised timeless beauty, often the backdrop of postcards and a favoured retreat for travellers.Fast forward to 2025, and the state's idyllic beaches are under siege, with Shankumugham shrinking to a mere patch in 30 years since Sujith's playtime days.Today, these shores tell a tale of relentless erosion, rising sea levels, the ravages of sand mining, and communities struggling to hold onto their seafront homes. Over 55% of Kerala's 590km coastline is now ""vulnerable to erosion"".Two major studies in recent years, one by the National Centre for Coastal Research and another by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), have painted a stark picture of Kerala's coastal future.According to INCOIS, more than 300km of the state's coastline fall into high and medium vulnerability categories, with some areas experiencing erosion at rates as high as six metres a year. This rapid erosion threatens not only the natural landscape but the livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3 million people spread across nine coastal districts.In regions like Kannur, Kochi, Alappuzha, and Kasaragod, the encroaching sea is a daily reminder of vulnerability. Beaches in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Malappuram, and parts of Thrissur have already vanished or are in the process of disappearing.This accelerating loss is exacerbated by the warming Arabian Sea, which has led to an increase in cyclonic events and sea surges, particularly from May to Aug, with a peak in June and July.The human cost of this environmental crisis is immense. Many coastal communities have been displaced, their homes swallowed by the sea, leaving behind a trail of economic and emotional distress.For as long as anyone can remember, fishing communities along Alappuzha's coast have lived by the saying ""Kadalamma chatikkilla"" - the sea mother won't deceive. But as the shoreline erodes, that ancient faith is faltering. Sand mining, the silent thief, has stripped the beaches, forcing many to abandon their ancestral homes. Over 600 houses have crumbled into the sea's maw, and poverty grips the fisherfolk tighter each day.""I know no life but fishing,"" said Kalesh, a fisherman from near Thottappally harbour, watching the sea that once nurtured his community now gnaw at it. His parents live next door in a house built after the 2004 tsunami swept away their old one, but even this home bears the scars of erosion.""The catch has dwindled,"" Kalesh's mother Sura said. ""And there's no beach left to haul our boat ashore."" Their blue boat rests awkwardly in their yard, a silent testament to the changing tides.K C Sreekumar from Alappad recalled a time when the coastal stretch from Azheekkal to Vellanathuruth spanned 89sq km in 1955. By 2004, it had shrunk to a mere 7sq km. The once-thriving Alappad market, where small ships anchored, is now a shadow of its former self, as the sea continues its relentless advance.Many families have been forced to relocate, some never returning to their original homes. Others, constrained by financial limitations or fear of starting anew elsewhere, have chosen to stay, clinging to what remains of their lives along the coast.Businesses dependent on tourism are struggling to stay afloat. Aneesh, who runs Jeevan Beach Resort in Kovalam, said: ""Earlier, the beach had a width of 30m. Now, it is only 10m and hasn't been restored fully for the past two years. It affected the inflow of tourists, especially foreigners. Now, they come and check out the very next day. Earlier, they used to stay here for three months. Kovalam has lost its glory.""The waves have ""swallowed the walkway"" and tourists are vanishing, leaving local business owners like Senthil K, Jose Franklyn and Biju to struggle with plummeting sales. ""My sales have dropped by 70%,"" souvenir shop owner Senthil said. The once ""vibrant spot"" is now deserted, prompting desperate calls for urgent govt action to ""save the beach and our businesses"".Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) recently highlighted the scale of the crisis. From 2012 to 2021, the state experienced 223 sea surge events, with Alappuzha facing the highest number at 105, followed by Ernakulam (64) and Thrissur (54).Central Kerala, the hub of marine trade and tourism, is particularly vulnerable, experiencing an average of 12 hazard events for every 10km. Areas such as Eriyad, Azhikode, Chellanam, Ambalappuzha, Purakkad, Kuzhupilly, and Vadanapilly are now categorised as high-hazard zones due to a combination of sea surge inundation, sea-level rise, and severe erosion.""South and central Kerala are more susceptible because of their sandy coasts, unlike the rocky shores in the north,"" said Girish Gopinath, head of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems at KUFOS.The primary reasons cited for these changes are inadequate scientific planning of coastal infrastructure and the effects of climate change.More than 50% of Kerala's coastline is lined with artificial structures such as groynes, various types of seawalls and fishing harbours, in addition to ports. Groynes typically consist of wooden or concrete barriers, built perpendicular to a shoreline to prevent erosion, trap sand, and protect beaches from the impact of waves and tides.However, such structures have proved counter-productive, particularly in the south, where sediments are often washed away by littoral currents that flow parallel to a shoreline. According to Gopinath, this structural interference with natural sediment flows has intensified erosion, leaving areas like Cherthala and Ponnani exposed to the sea's relentless encroachment.""There is a phenomenon where seawater overtops into the shore, bringing with it large amounts of sediment. Unfortunately, due to choked and encroached canals, there is no way for the water and mud to flow back, exacerbating the problem,"" he said.Kerala University geology professor E Shaji pointed to the acute shortage of sediment supply from rivers, exacerbated by dredging, sand mining and sediment trapping by dams, as a major contributor to the problem. ""It would take at least five years to revive a beach,"" he said.As Kerala battles against nature and neglect, experts agree that an aggressive coastal management plan is critical. Without swift and coordinated action, the state's once-pristine beaches could be lost to history.Senior scientist K K Ramachandran emphasised the need for precise and up-to-date data to guide coastal development and conservation, ensuring that interventions are based on accurate tracking of erosion and accretion. ""Only a handful of projects use the latest data. We require a year's worth of data before proceeding with building any structures,"" said consultant at National Centre for Earth Science Studies.(Inputs from M K Sunil Kumar, T C Sreemol, Jaikrishnan Nair, Krishnachand K)","Erosion threatens livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3m across 9 Kerala coastal dists.

key vote bank, especially in central, south Delhi

NEW DELHI: Three weeks before Delhi votes, Modi government announced on Thursday the setting up of the eighth pay commission , a move that will benefit not only 1.1 crore central govt employees and pensioners, including defence personnel, but also those working in the NCT administration and other states and UTs.The decision, which had been pending for several months, is also expected to buoy sentiments amid sagging consumption demand, with the award to be implemented from 2026.""We are all proud of the efforts of all govt employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on pay commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption,"" PM Modi posted on X hours after I&B minister Ashwani Vaishnaw announced getting the green light from him.Modi opted to announce the new panel on the eve of the polls in Delhi, which has around four lakh govt employees. In 2014, Manmohan Singh had announced the seventh pay commission at the end of Feb, weeks before general elections were announced.The seventh pay commission saw additional expenditure of Rs 1 lakh crore during 2016-17. Effective July, the Centre is offering a dearness allowance of 53% of the basic pay or pension.While the last panel had recommended a fitment factor of 2.57 times - increasing the salary in pay band 1 from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 a month, this time govt is looking at the possibility of a further hike, sources indicated. In 2008, around the time of the global financial crisis, the UPA had opted for a fitment factor of 1.86 against the recommended 1.74, arguing that it would provide a fillip to consumption.However, it is still early days given that Thursday's announcement will be followed by the constitution of the pay panel, which is typically headed by a retired Supreme Court judge with retired secretaries and economists as members.The implementation of the panel's award is typically backed by an increase in demand for white goods, automobiles and real estate, and govt employees use the arrears and higher monthly income to indulge in purchases they often delay.For Delhi assembly polls, especially in constituencies in central and south Delhi, govt employees are a crucial vote bank. Just a few months ago, the Centre had also tweaked the National Pension System, which requires every employee who joined from 2004 to contribute, to guarantee a pension of 50% of the last pay drawn. The Centre will make good any shortfall in case the market return is lower and has also decided to provide for inflation adjustment for those who opt for what is now called the Unified Pension Scheme from April.","The decision had been pending for several months.

Supreme Court to study 'major' question on age in child marriage law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-study-major-question-on-age-in-child-marriage-law/articleshow/117309785.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prohibition of Child Marriage Act does not make a child marriage void but prescribes that any minor spouse can seek annulment of marriage within two years of becoming major. Under the law, a minor girl or any of her well-wishers, if they so choose, can challenge her marriage up to the age of 20. She is considered to be a major and marriageable after turning 18.But a serious problem arises in the case of a male minor because of the discrepancy between the ages when he is deemed to turn a major; that is 18, and when he is legally eligible to marry, that is 21. Supreme Court has decided to examine the issue and issued notice on a plea filed by a woman against an Allahabad HC order which had held that the age of becoming major for males under the Act was 21 years and annulled her marriage on her husband's plea who was around 23 years of age at the time.Section 3 of the Act says every child marriage shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of marriage and a petition may be filed at any time but before the child filing the petition completes two years of attaining majority.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Ahsanuddin Amanullah agreed to hear the woman's plea and issued notice to her spouse. In her plea, the woman contended that the HC committed an error in annulling the marriage which was solemnised in 2004 when she was nine years old and her husband was 12.""Interpretation and application of Section 3 of the PCM Act as rendered by the HC in its judgment extends the limitation period for filing a suit to void a child marriage up to the age of 23 for a male. This is in direct conflict with the legislative purpose, constitutional principles and the protective ethos of the PCM Act,"" she said in her petition filed through advocate Saurabh Ajay Gupta.In this case, the marriage was solemnised by their parents and the husband became major (18 years) in 2010 and she in 2013. The husband thereafter filed a divorce petition in 2013. Four years later, he invoked Section 3 of the Act for annulment of marriage and amended the suit. But his plea was dismissed on the ground that he had first filed a divorce plea which meant that he implicitly confirmed and ratified the validity of the child marriage. The husband then moved the HC in 2018 and in Oct last year, the court allowed his plea for annulment of marriage. While the marriage was declared void, the HC ordered payment of permanent alimony of Rs 25 lakh to the wife.""The respondent, having attained majority on Aug 7, 2010, filed the annulment petition on July 5, 2013, well beyond the limitation period prescribed under PCM Act. The HC failed to appreciate the distinction between the age of legal capacity to marry and the age of legal capacity to institute legal proceedings,"" the woman said in her petition.","Prohibition of Child Marriage Act does not make a child marriage void but prescribes that any minor spouse can seek annulment of marriage within two years of becoming major.

The JDU seeks action from the BJP's leadership against Poonawalla for his comments.""The controversy started during a heated TV debate on Wednesday, in which Poonawalla made a jibe about AAP MLA Rituraj Jha's surname.

The report, currently sealed, will be opened in the cabinet hall two hours before the meeting, he added.This decision comes after govt faced criticism for deferring the report's release at Thursday's cabinet meeting, reportedly under pressure from various caste groups.The date of the next cabinet meeting is still undecided. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil defended the delay, citing administrative concerns. ""We will certainly open the sealed cover at the next cabinet,"" he said.State industries minister MB Patil, a prominent Lingayat face in the governing Congress, meanwhile said that excluding Lingayat sub-sects from the caste census report would amount to a grave injustice, comments that could trigger a political storm. ""Many Lingayat sub-sects have registered as Hindus due to reservation policies, but they remain part of the Lingayat community,"" Patil said. ""We need to bring these sub-sects under one umbrella. Only then will the true picture emerge. If they are left out, it's a mistake. If the report is correct, we are fine; if not, we will ask the CM to rectify it,"" MB Patil said. ""People belonging to Lingayat subsects have identified themselves as Hindu Ganiga, Hindu Sadhu, Hindu Banajiga, Hindu Reddy, and others to avail of reservations under categories 2A and 3A. This does not mean they are not Lingayats,"" MB Patil said. ""They must be counted as Lingayats regardless of what they have written; everyone knows these are Lingayat sub-castes.""State law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil dismissed reports that govt feared a backlash from dominant communities over alleged leaked numbers. ""This is just speculation. The report remains sealed and safely deposited in the treasury. No numbers from the official report have been made public,"" he added.The caste census, commissioned during Siddaramaiah's first tenure as CM in 2014, has been a topic of debate since its completion in 2016. Conducted at a cost of Rs 169 crore under the Backward Classes Commission led by H Kantharaju, the census findings remained in cold storage during successive govts, including the Congress-JD(S) coalition and BJP administrations. The final report, submitted by commission chief Jayaprakash Hegde in Feb 2024, is yet to be opened.RDPR minister Priyank Kharge stressed that the document is a socio-economic survey, not a caste census.

Motivated bid to undermine secularism: Congress' plea to shield places of worship law

NEW DELHI: Congress has moved Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, saying the law was ""essential to safeguard secularism in India "" which is a basic feature of the Constitution and was needed to ensure communal harmony .Seeking to intervene in the litigation initiated by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay , now with BJP, former MP Subramanian Swamy and other Hindu organisations who challenged the validity of the 1991 law, Congress sought outright dismissal of their petitions.Relying on the apex court's earlier verdicts, including its Ayodhya judgment, it said the court has on multiple occasions held that the focus of the nation must be towards the future and not at attempting to rectify atrocities of the past.""...The present challenge appears to be a motivated and malicious attempt to undermine established principles of secularism. The applicant seeks to intervene in this matter to emphasise the constitutional and societal significance of the POW Act , as it apprehends that any alterations to it could jeopardise India's communal harmony and secular fabric, thereby threatening the sovereignty and integrity of the nation,"" Congress said in its plea.The application, filed through advocate Abishek Jebaraj, said the petitions against the Act appeared to have been filed with oblique and questionable motives. ""The applicant seeks to oppose the present challenge to Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act, on the grounds that the POW Act plays a pivotal role in furthering the right to freedom of religion and protects secularism, which is an established basic feature of the Constitution. The instant petition challenges a legislation that both in form and substance safeguards fundamental rights and the basic features of the Constitution of India, including but not limited to secularism and fraternity,"" it said.The law's validity has been challenged on multiple grounds, including that it is discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights and the petitioners have sought that Sections 3 and 4 of the Act be declared void and unconstitutional for being violative of Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution in so far as it seeks to validate 'places of worship' illegally made by ""barbaric invaders"".Section 3 of the Act puts a bar on conversion of places of worship and Section 4 prohibits courts from entertaining appeals and challenges to the religious character of certain places of worship and says the religious character of a place of worship as existing on Aug 15, 1947, shall continue to be the same.Countering the petitioner, Congress said their contention was patently flawed and POW Act was not in contravention of any fundamental rights .","Congress has moved Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act.

Ruidas, a resident of Garbeta in West Midnapore, had breathed her last on Jan 10 - a month since the stop-manufacture order had been issued.The bench was hearing two PILs that sought court intervention on the issue, claiming that the death was directly due to the use of the suspect saline solution. The lawyer for one of the petitioners, Phiroze Edulji, told the court that the company was banned for three years by another state govt last March, and that Bengal govt had been informed about this. The Siliguri regional office of Directorate of Drugs Control, a govt arm, had sent out the stop-manufacture order to the pharma company on Dec 10.Advocate general Kishore Datta informed the bench that the remaining stock had been withdrawn. The company's lawyer also said that they had stopped manufacturing the particular solution after the suspension notice was issued.The CJ said the health department should have frozen all stocks of the medicine the moment the order had been issued. The AG replied that the difficulty was over how to replace 30,000 units, which were already sent to state facilities, overnight.The court noted that action was taken by the Directorate of Health Service, Central Medical Store, on Jan 14, 2025 - by which a direction, banning all drugs manufactured by the company, had been issued to all medical colleges and hospitals. The CJ said both PILs had flagged the important issue of safety and health of Bengal's citizens, particularly those who use govt-run medical hospitals.The bench directed the chief secretary to file a report on the incident.

NEW DELHI: In a season of making annual declarations on investments and deduction, the income tax department has put employees and employers on notice after it came across lakhs of instances of individuals making bogus claims related to donations to political parties and charitable organisations as well as false investment and interest payment claims.It all goes back to searches and surveys conducted by the tax department in the last few years, which showed individuals claiming deductions for donations to unrecognised political parties that enjoy certain tax exemptions.Authorities found several instances of money being returned to the donors. In a large number of cases, it was found that actual donations were not made.""For political donations, there is no third-party verification, and individuals have been taking a chance, expecting they would not be caught. We have seen instances of employees of some companies indulging in fraudulent claims like these, there are thousands of such cases ,"" said a tax officer.A deeper analysis revealed that there were instances of bogus donations even to charities with some individuals claiming interest payment on loans for higher education when no loan had even been taken. There have also been cases where PAN numbers of individuals have been shared to claim tax free house rent allowance when no property has even been taken on rent.From investments (section 80C of the I-T Act) to health insurance premiums (section 80D), education loans (80E), specified charities (80G), political parties and electoral trusts (80GGB and 80 GGC) violations were observed, prompting a standard operating procedure being developed by the investigation wing to develop a standard operating procedure and approach employees and employers and individuals to revise their tax returns, or face action.Till Dec 2024, around 90,000 taxpayers have withdrawn incorrect deduction claims, which add up to Rs 1,070 crores, and have also paid additional taxes.Officials said the actual cases are nearly three times higher than the number of returns that have been updated and a drive is being launched to focus on employers to educate their employees, especially when there are certain clusters of companies where such violations are more rampant.","Till Dec 2024, around 90,000 taxpayers have withdrawn incorrect deduction claims, which add up to Rs 1,070 crores.

NEW DELHI: Observing that absence of adequate washroom facilities in court premises undermines equality and poses a barrier to the fair administration of justice, Supreme Court has directed states and all high courts to ensure the construction of separate toilet facilities for males, females, transgender and persons with disability in all court premises and tribunals across the country.A bench of J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan directed HCs to form a committee headed by its judge and comprising the chief secretary, the PWD secretary and the finance secretary of the state, a representative of the Bar Association to undertake the task. ""In our opinion, toilets / washrooms / restrooms are not merely a matter of convenience, but a basic necessity which is a facet of human rights. Access to proper sanitation is recognised as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. This right inherently includes ensuring a safe and hygienic environment for all individuals. ....

""This not only violates the rights of those directly affected but also tarnishes the reputation of the judicial system, which should serve as a model of fairness, dignity, and justice. The failure to provide adequate washroom facilities is not just a logistical issue, but it reflects a deeper flaw in the justice system. The sorry state of affairs indicates the harsh reality that the judicial system has not entirely fulfilled its constitutional obligation to provide a safe, dignified, and equal environment for all those seeking justice,""it said.It said that courts should not be places where basic needs, such as sanitation, are overlooked and neglected. ""The absence of adequate washroom facilities undermines equality and poses a barrier to the fair administration of justice. Therefore, all High Courts must take swift and effective action to address this issue. Immediate steps are needed to ensure that all judicial premises, especially those lacking proper facilities, are equipped with accessible washroom facilities for the judges, litigants, advocates, and staff. It is re-emphasised that this is not just a matter of convenience, but is about basic rights and human dignity. Failing to act promptly would compromise the very purpose and essence of the judiciary's role in our society,""it said.","Supreme Court has mandated states and high courts to construct separate toilet facilities for males, females, transgender, and persons with disabilities.

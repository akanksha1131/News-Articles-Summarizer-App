NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23, prolonging the restrictions for another month amid continuing tensions between the two countries.The Pakistan Airports Authority confirmed the move in a fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), stating, “All aircraft operated by Indian airlines will not be allowed to use Pakistani airspace. The ban also remains in place for military and civilian aircraft that are Indian-owned or leased.”The restrictions were first imposed on April 23 for one month following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India retaliated on April 30 by announcing a reciprocal closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines.Since then, both sides have repeatedly extended the curbs. On May 23, Pakistan prolonged its ban after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. Another NOTAM later extended the closure from June 23 to July 24, stating, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The tit-for-tat measures have left carriers from both countries barred from flying over each other’s territory, with every extension keeping the restrictions in place.",Pakistan extends its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23.

"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

SC frowns on governments hiring temp staffers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-frowns-on-governments-hiring-temp-staffers/articleshow/123420796.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Deprecating the practice of Centre and states not appointing permanent employees and getting their work done by temporary and daily-wage staff, Supreme Court on Tuesday said governments should behave like a ""constitutional employer"" and not like a mere market player.It directed the UP government to regularise from 2002 the services of class 3 and 4 employees who have been working for the state Education Services Selection Commission, reports AmitAnand ChoudharyA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said govts should not invoke budgetary constraints to justify ad-hocism. The state, as a constitutional employer, should maintain a higher standard.The state, as a constitutional employer, deal with perennial work on a sanctioned footing, creating a budget for the purpose, Supreme Court held.""We think it necessary to recall the state (here referring to both the Union and the State govts) is not a mere market participant but a constitutional employer. It cannot balance budgets on backs of those who perform most basic and recurring public functions. Where work recurs day after day and year after year, the establishment must reflect that reality in its sanctioned strength and engagement practices. The long-term extraction of regular labour under temporary labels corrodes confidence in public administration and offends the promise of equal protection.Financial stringency certainly has a place in public policy, but it is not a talisman that overrides fairness, reason and the duty to organise work on lawful lines,"" the bench said.SC passed the order on a petition seeking regularisation of jobs of people who had been performing peon/attendant duties for the commission since 1989. Allowing their plea, SC directed that their services be regularised from 2002, with arrears being paid until the date of regularisation/retirement/death, as the case may be.""It must necessarily be noted ad-hocism thrives where administration is opaque. The state departments must keep and produce accurate establishment registers, muster rolls and outsourcing arrangements, and they must explain, with evidence, why they prefer precarious engagement over sanctioned posts where the work is perennial. If constraint is invoked, the record should show what alternatives were considered, why similarly placed workers were treated differently, and how the chosen course aligns with Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court criticises practice of Centre and states not appointing permanent employees.

Government: Governor can scrap bill by withholding assent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-governor-can-scrap-bill-by-withholding-assent/articleshow/123420773.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Amid conflicts between governors and opposition-led governments in states, the Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that if a governor, in rare and extraordinary circumstances, chooses to withhold assent to a bill passed by a state assembly, the bill gets scrapped.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta had to labour a good part of the day before a five-judge Constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar to explain the sweeping power conferred on governors through Article 200 of the Constitution.The proposition, which the SG said, is backed by two five-judge SC bench judgments categorically stating that if a governor exercised the option of withholding assent, then the bill ""falls through"", evoked questions from a bench that was clearly alive to frequent stalemates between governors and state govts over indefinite pendency of bills with the former.Mehta said on a bill, the governor has options of granting assent, withholding assent, reserving it for the President's consideration or returning it to the assembly with suggestions for modification. ""Once he declares he has withheld assent, the bill falls through. The governor then cannot exercise any of the other three options,"" he said. ""The governor can simpliciter withhold assent ...if he believes the bill is unconstitutional or beyond any remedial changes, in which case the bill would 'fall through' or lapse as has been observed in several SC judgments by five-judge benches.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta argued that the Constitution fixes no timeline for governors, in exercise of their plenary powers, to choose any of the four options. ""The constitutional provision conferring such powers on the governor can only be amended by Parliament and the judiciary cannot encroach on the legislative domain in the guise of interpretation,"" Mehta said in what appeared to be a challenge aimed at the verdict of a two-judge bench fixing deadlines for governors and the President to take a call on bills sent to them for assent.CJI Gavai said similar arguments were advanced by ruling dispensations when it came to SC directing the speaker to decide within a timeframe petitions on disqualification of MLAs under the anti-defection law. For the sake of democracy, SC has fixed timelines for speakers in such cases, he said.Mehta, however, argued that the two cases are not alike since the speaker, while adjudicating petitions under the anti-defection law, acts as a tribunal and not in his/her constitutional capacity. It is a settled law that as a tribunal he is amenable to the jurisdictions of HCs and SC, he further argued. The SG said discretionary power to 'withhold assent to a bill' is one of the few areas, delineated by the Constitution, where the governor is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers of the state. ""Because no council of ministers would advise the governor to withhold assent to a bill, yet that power is specifically given by the Constitutio,"" he said.The SG cited 10 illustrative situations where the governor would be well within his discretionary powers to withhold assent to a bill to render it ineffective. He said, for instance, if a border state enacts a law allowing citizens of a neighbouring country free entry into the state, the governor would be justified in withholding assent.","Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta had to labour a good part of the day before a five-judge Constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.

NEW DELHI: Barely hours after its introduction on Wednesday, Lok Sabha passed a bill to not only prohibit online games played with money but also regulate, promote and encourage the sector to ensure a ""developed, safe and responsible"" digital environment for all citizens.The proposed legislation - Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 - was passed without a debate by a voice vote amid din as opposition members raised slogans demanding a discussion on Bihar SIR.Once the legislation becomes a law after being passed by RS and receiving presidential assent, offering or facilitating online money gaming will be punishable by jail of up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore.Moving the bill, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said govt seeks to encourage e-sports and online social gaming that do not involve money and will set up an authority for the purpose. Vaishnaw introduced the bill amid sloganeering by opposition members during the first half, when the House assembled after the first adjournment.He said online money gaming has become a matter of concern as such platforms have led to addiction among youth and have also been used for fraud and cheating.Justifying the govt's move to ban online money gaming, the minister, in the statement of object and reasons of the bill, said the unchecked and widespread proliferation of such games, which are readily accessible through mobile devices and computers, and offer monetary returns in exchange for deposited funds has led to ""grave social, economic, and psychological consequences across the country"". tnn","The proposed legislation - Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 - was passed without a debate by a voice vote.

India must keep tight vigil along LAC: Army officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-must-keep-tight-vigil-along-lac-army-officials/articleshow/123420651.cms,"Many PLA arms brigades still remain forward deployed



New Delhi: India will militarily have to be extremely alert on the ground if long-drawn de-escalation process with China kicks off in the coming months amid the ongoing Sino -Indian detente, against the backdrop of PLA having the requisite infrastructure in place to return swiftly to forward locations along the frontier.""The way China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire LAC, from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal, over the last five years, PLA troops can easily afford to pull back 100-150km and then come back again in 2-3 hours,"" a senior Army officer told TOI.Our forces cannot. This huge time differential in mobilisation between the rival forces will have to be factored in during any de-escalation talks,a senior Army officer said.To be sure, India and China have as yet only decided to “discuss de-escalation, beginning with the principles and modalities thereof” during Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit this week. On the ground, the trust deficit between the rival armies, which have remained forward deployed with heavy weapons all along the 3,488-km LAC after multiple PLA incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020, remains “quite high”, though the situation is no longer on hair-trigger alert as before.The situation has stabilised after troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok last Oct. “There is no disruption in the coordinated patrolling by the rival soldiers there. But we cannot let our guard down since there has been no let-up in the PLA’s military preparedness and infrastructure build-up,” another officer said.While some of the PLA’s combined arms brigades have pulled back around 100 km from the LAC over the last few months, many still remain forward deployed along with its border defence regiments. Each CAB has around 4,500-5,000 soldiers with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapon systems.De-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC will entail the return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations. The two countries, meanwhile, are using existing border management mechanisms at the diplomatic and military levels to maintain peace along the LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. To this end, the two sides have now also decided to set up “general-level mechanisms” in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC, to add to the existing talks mechanism between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief in western (Ladakh) one.From the Indian side, it is likely to be the Lt-General commanding the Uttar Bharat (UB) Area based in Bareilly, which has been “combatised”, in the middle sector. Similarly, in the eastern one, it could be the Lt-Generals commanding the Dimapur-based 3 Corps or the Tezpur-based 4 Corps.In eastern Ladakh, the immediate priority would be the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” on patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, Kailash Range and larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3 km to 10 km, which came up on what India considers to be its own territory. But there has been no movement on the issue since then.","China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire LAC.

Poll What are your thoughts on Yuzvendra Chahal's choice of attire at the divorce hearing? Inappropriate and disrespectful A bold statement Completely fine, it's his choice I have no opinion on it

Yuzvendra Chahal's estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma, has finally spoken about her divorce and slammed the Indian cricketer for his attire at the divorce hearing.Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy”. The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree.“Divorce is not something to celebrate. It’s not a celebration; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional. People must not forget that it’s not just about the two individuals, but also about the families involved—those who genuinely love and care about you,” she said on the podcast Spill The Tea.“I also believe true grief and chaos in a marriage have to be understood and acknowledged by both parties. Marriage begins with love, but when it ends, it often ends in distrust. The day it actually happened was very emotional for me, my family, and I’m sure for everyone around us. Even though we were mentally prepared for it, when the verdict was about to be given, I broke down completely. I started howling in front of everyone,” she recalled.Dhanashree strongly criticised Chahal’s choice of t-shirt on the divorce hearing.“He walked out first, and that whole t-shirt episode unfolded. I wasn’t even aware of it at the time because I was still inside. I left through the back door because I didn’t want to face the media. I was just wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans.“I sat in my car, still trying to catch my breath. Before I even realised what had happened, people began speculating about me because of that stunt. Sitting there, I felt like, ‘It’s done. It’s dusted.’“Somewhere, I did feel bad. Why was I even crying about this? Then I thought, forget it—let’s just end this. That moment gave me the motivation to laugh and move on. It’s over,” she added.","Yuzvendra Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy’ The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree. “Divorce is not something to celebrate; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123398560,imgsize-53994,width-400,resizemode-4/123398560.jpg"

Rain fury in Mumbai

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Wednesday issued a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai, which the airline said could ""lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations"".""While we want your journey to be as hassle-free as possible, Mother Nature has her own plans. With heavy rains expected again in Mumbai, there’s a chance this could lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations,"" the issue said.The IndiGo assured that any changes to the flight schedule will be shared with the passengers and urged them to spare extra time for the commute.""While we continue doing our best to keep operations smooth, we recommend planning ahead. Any changes to your flight schedule will be shared via your registered contact details, so do ensure they’re up to date. Check your flight status on our website or app before heading to the airport. And with waterlogging and slow-moving traffic likely, allow some extra time for your commute,"" the release by the airline said.On Tuesday, flight operations suffered partially in the city amid the heavy rains. From Monday midnight to 7 pm Tuesday, 11 flights were diverted to other airports, while 24 arriving flights were forced to abort landing and climb to make a second attempt at touchdown.The cascading delays hit flight schedules through the day, and worst hit were passengers booked on evening flights, with arrivals and departures delayed by an hour.Just like Monday, auto and taxi refusals were rampant. Power outages were witnessed in the suburbs. Kurla suffered as two substations of Adani Electricity shut down, affecting 1,000 families. Andheri, Jogeshwari, Kandivli, Ghatkopar, Vile Parle and Mira Road also saw power cuts.In one of the record number of diversions by BEST in recent years, 135 bus routes were diverted due to waterlogging on roads as heavy rain crippled Mumbai on Tuesday.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) red alert for Tuesday proved spot-on as the city endured another day of intense rainfall, making this the wettest Aug in five years. So far, 891 mm of rain has been recorded, well above the average monthly rainfall of 560.8 mm. The last time Mumbai saw higher Aug rainfall was in the year 2020, when 1,240.1 mm was recorded.The monsoon season total has also crossed expectations, reaching 2,193.2 mm, surpassing the average of 2,101.8 mm.Rainfall data further indicates that this has been one of Mumbai’s longest intense rain spells in recent years. In the past 108 hours (Aug 15–19), the city received 837.3 mm, with three of the five days logging close to or over 200 mm. This exceeds the total rainfall of June (512.7 mm) and July (797.3 mm); July is normally considered the year’s wettest month.Tuesday’s downpour was clearly much more intense than Monday’s. The IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 163.4 mm rain in a nine-hour period between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm — more than Monday’s tally of 129.1 mm for the same period. Vikhroli too saw a sharp spike at 161.5 mm, up from 139.5 mm, while Juhu, Byculla and Bandra logged marginal increases. Colaba weather station also recorded 63 mm of rain in the same period compared to 55.4 mm the previous day.The 24-hour period ending 8.30 am on Aug 19 also saw some extremely heavy rain being recorded of over 300 mm in some pockets. Chincholi in Malad reported a staggering 361 mm, one of the highest across the city.Tuesday’s spell added to a rare pattern — Mumbai inching towards yet another 200 mm-plus rain day within less than a week, after logging 244 mm between Aug 15-16 and 238 mm on Aug 18–19. In the 12 hours ending 8.30 pm on Tuesday, the IMD Santacruz observatory had already recorded 171.2 mm of rain.The rain fury also spilled into the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, with Thane, Kalyan, Vasai and Virar reporting triple-digit showers. In the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Aug 19, Vasai recorded 219 mm of rain while Navi Mumbai logged in 185 mm.The rain fury is expected to continue till Wednesday under an orange alert for Mumbai, with the IMD indicating some relief only from Thursday, when a yellow alert has been issued signalling reduced intensity.","IndiGo issues a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai.

Why Pakistan is on edge

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday successfully test-fired its nuclear-capable intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) Agni-5 from the integrated test range (ITR) at Chandipur in Odisha, the defence ministry said.The launch, conducted on August 20, 2025, under the strategic forces command, validated all operational and technical parameters of the missile. Defence officials said the test was part of routine user trials aimed at ensuring the system’s readiness.Developed by the defence research and development organisation (DRDO), Agni-5 is among India’s most advanced long-range missiles with a range of over 5,000 kilometres. Equipped with modern navigation, guidance, warhead and propulsion technologies, it strengthens India’s nuclear deterrence.The ministry said the successful test reaffirms India’s commitment to maintaining a “credible minimum deterrence posture.”India’s test has raised alarms in Islamabad. The Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), a Pakistan-based think tank, has warned Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and army chief Asim Munir that India’s missile programme poses “serious risks” to regional stability.The SVI noted that India’s missile development accelerated after it joined the missile technology control regime (MTCR) in 2016, gaining access to advanced systems.It warned that with future variants exceeding 8,000 km range, India could potentially target cities as far as Washington, Moscow and Beijing.Pakistan’s concerns also extend to India’s growing naval nuclear arsenal, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles. According to the think tank, the Agni-5 test signals India’s global strategic ambitions and calls for international pressure on New Delhi to “refrain from destabilising moves” and pursue dialogue instead.","Agni-5 is a land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) with Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) capability.

‘India Profiting From Russian Oil’: Scott Bessent Hits Out Again Over Arbitrage, But Backs China

The NCP is believed to have developed ties with the far-right Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist groups in opposition to the BNP.","MEA: India does not permit political activities targeting other countries from its soil.

Sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them: Babushkin

NEW DELHI: As external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited Moscow Wednesday for bilateral talks on trade and economic issues, Russian diplomats here defended energy ties with India and expressed confidence that both countries would handle challenges arising out of the US sanctions against India that they described as unjustified and extremely unfortunate.""It is a challenging situation for India. We enjoy trust in our partnership with India and are committed to addressing challenges in our energy ties,"" said Babushkin, adding Russia has a ""special mechanism"" to deal with any challenge on the sanction issue.Bloomberg quoted the Russian deputy trade representative here as saying that Moscow sells oil to India at about a 5% discount.The Russian embassy later said “regarding oil import prices amid tariffs, a 5% swing is possible subject to negotiation”.The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India to penalise it for oil purchase from Russia. The tariff comes into effect on Aug 27 and despite hopes of a peace agreement emerging from the Putin-Trump Alaska summit, India continues to be targeted by US officials for “profiteering” from Russian oil.“Russia is the biggest supplier to India of crude oil and India’s demands are growing. Certainly, this is a perfect case of mutual accommodation and complementarity of our economies,” said Babushkin.Last week, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned that the Trump administration may increase secondary tariffs on India if it continues to procure Russian crude oil. This week, he accused Indian companies of profiteering from Russian oil trade.“The sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them. We are confident that India-Russia energy cooperation will continue notwithstanding the external pressure,” Babushkin said, accusing the West of behaving like neo-colonial powers.“If hypothetically speaking, India refuses to procure Russian oil, it will not lead to mutually beneficial cooperation with the West,” the Russian diplomat said, adding bilateral trade is likely to reach $100 billion by 2030.Asked about American tariffs on Indian goods, he said the Russian market will welcome Indian exports. He also said the role of Brics as a stabilising force will increase amid the ongoing global turbulence.In terms of GDP, the size of the economy of Brics is about USD 77 trillion while it is USD 57 trillion for Group of Seven (G7) nations, he said, arguing that the Brics is emerging as a major economic power.",Sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them: Babushkin.

Bill is in violation of presumption of innocence, says oppn in Lok Sabha



NEW DELHI: The ongoing acrimony between the opposition and the treasury, witnessed throughout the monsoon session of Parliament, reached a flashpoint in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday when Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the three bills that provide a legal framework for removing the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and Union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.Shah said that the three legislations will be referred to a joint parliamentary committee for detailed scrutiny even as opposition MPs, essentially from Trinamool Congress and Congress, launched into aggressive protests and tore copies of the bills. They trooped into the well of the House, near Shah's front-row seat.Opposition MPs said the bills violated constitutional principles, undermined federalism, and inverted the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty."" They warned of potential misuse for political purposes and the risk of transforming India into a police state.Pandemonium broke out as soon as home minister Amit Shah sought to move the three bills — the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025 — which propose that if the PM, ministers or CMs are arrested and detained for 30 days for offences carrying a jail term of at least five years, they will lose their positions on the 31st day.Shah justified the legislations, “We cannot be so shameless (ham itne nirlajj nahi ho sakte) as to occupy constitutional positions while facing charges,” home minister said.Initially, only Trinamool MPs, led by Kalyan Banerjee, stormed the well. After Congress netas K C Venugopal and Manish Tewari spoke, Venugopal tore a copy of the bill, and Congress MPs joined TMC in protest. Venugopal questioned Shah’s claim of upholding public morality, referring to Shah’s 2010 arrest as Gujarat’s home minister.Shah countered, stating he had resigned on moral grounds before his arrest on “false” allegations and refrained from holding constitutional positions until cleared by courts. “I want to remind Congress that I had already resigned before being arrested, and even after being released on bail, I did not take any constitutional position until I was proven innocent by the court.” He added, “The court dismissed the false case against me, stating that it was motivated by political vendetta. ”Three opposition MPs — Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), N K Premachandran (RSP) and Manish Tewari (Congress) — opposed the bill saying that it is in violation of presumption of innocence, which is the bedrock of administration and a marked assualt on the basic structure of the Constitution. Tewari called the bills “squarely destructive” to the Constitution’s basic structure, arguing they bypassed due process and made investigating officers the “boss of the Prime Minister”.Owaisi accused the govt of enabling executive agencies to act as judge, jury, and executioner based on flimsy allegations, likening the proposed system to Nazi Germany’s Gestapo. Venugopal claimed the bills aimed to sabotage India’s federal structure.Shah rejected Premachandran’s contention that the bills were brought in haste, saying they will be sent to a joint panel, where members of both Houses would get an opportunity to give their suggestions.The constitutional amendment bill requires two-thirds support in both Houses — a majority that the governing alliance currently lacks.One opposition MP twisted Shah’s mic, while others continued throwing bits of paper at him, prompting treasury MPs to rush into the well. MPs from both sides stood face-to-face, exchanging threats, and even after the House was adjourned, opposition MPs continued shouting slogans.BJP MPs, including ministers Kiren Rijiju and Ravneet Bittu, moved to block opposition MPs from approaching Shah. The home minister, however, asked his colleagues to return to their seats. Congress MP Deepender Hooda also intervened, preventing opposition MPs from entering the aisle. Normalcy returned only after Shah and other ministers left the House as the opposition members jeered.When House resumed an hour later, the bills were referred to JPC, but proceedings occurred under tight security, with marshals present. Shah, instead of taking his front row seat, sat in the third row as opposition MPs again occupied the well. Govt sources said that their focus was on getting the legislations passed.","Three bills provide legal framework for removing the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and Union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.

RCB Victory Parade Turns Into Nightmare; Fan Frenzy Outside Chinnaswamy Stadium Kills 7+ | Bengaluru

BENGALURU: Karnataka's government introduced a bill in the assembly on Wednesday that is intended to regulate public gatherings and punish violations.The move comes in wake of the stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium on June 4, during RCB's IPL victory celebrations, that resulted in 11 deaths.The Karnataka Crowd Control (Managing Crowd at Events and Places of Gathering) Bill, 2025 seeks to make organisers accountable for safety at public events, mandating prior permissions, safety clearances and indemnity bonds. The proposed legislation mandates that organisers deposit an indemnity bond of Rs 1 crore, which can be invoked in case of damage to public property or loss of life, and proposes jail terms of up to seven years for such violations.The assembly is expected to debate the bill on Thursday. State home minister G Parameshwara, who tabled the bill, said: ""We are bringing in this bill to ensure all safety norms at public events. Apart from punishing the organisers for violations, the legislation seeks to penalise the govt officials and police officers concerned.""Organising unpermitted events may attract imprisonment from three to seven years or fines up to Rs 1 lakh.If fatalities occur due to crowd disasters, the punishment could extend to life imprisonment.Negligence or recklessness leading to injuries can attract jail terms of three to seven years, while loss of life can result in jail sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.Civil disturbances, such as spreading rumours, creating panic, or instigating violence, will be punishable with up to three years in jail or a fine of Rs 50,000, or both. Disobeying police directions during gatherings will also draw penalties.","Karnataka's government introduced a bill in the assembly that is intended to regulate public gatherings and punish violations.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Batting aside Bangladesh's charge that members of the banned Awami League were carrying out political activities from India, New Delhi on Wednesday said it is not aware of purported members of the Sheikh Hasina-led party being engaged in anti-Bangladesh acts on Indian soil.Reacting to a statement of foreign office in Dhaka that Awami League had offices in Delhi and Kolkata, MEA asserted that India's consistent position has been not to allow activities against other countries from its soil. ""The press statement by interim govt of Bangladesh is thus misplaced.

""Many of senior leaders, absconding in criminal cases in Bangladesh on account of grievous crimes committed against humanity, remain in Indian territory,"" it said.","New Delhi says it is not aware of purported members of the Sheikh Hasina-led party being engaged in anti-Bangladesh acts on Indian soil.

Amit Shah: PM Modi got draft reworked to bring himself under ambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-pm-modi-got-draft-reworked-to-bring-himself-under-ambit/articleshow/123419314.cms,"PM Modi

NEW DELHI: It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had the draft of Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025 reworked to include himself in its ambit, home minister Amit Shah shared in a post on X on Wednesday.Sources in the government said Modi added the provision requiring a prime minister who spends 30 consecutive days under arrest or detention for an alleged offence punishable with a prison term extending up to five years or more, to resign on the 31st day, based on the reasoning that moral standards in politics must apply as much to prime ministers as they do to any chief minister or minister at the Centre and in states or Union Territories.The original draft of the 130th Constitutional amendment Bill had proposed to cover only chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in the states.As per the Bill, introduced by Shah on Wednesday, in case the prime minister does not tender his resignation on the 31st day of his arrest, ""he shall cease to hold office from the day falling thereafter"".The Bill was on Wednesday referred to a joint parliamentary committee for thorough scrutiny.Dismissing the opposition's charge that the Bill was a ploy by the Modi regime to dislodge state govts by having their chief ministers and ministers removed through arrest in ""motivated"" cases, a senior govt functionary said that the same provisions apply to the prime minister and Union ministers.The functionary said it was high time that the PM, CM and ministers display character and conduct that aligns with constitutional morality and principles of good governance, and cited the example of govt employees who are deemed suspended if detained in custody for only 48 hours.""Why should bureaucrats/govt personnel alone bear moral responsibility in the event of detention or arrest? Ministers are also public servants and must withdraw from office if arrested for 30 days. They can always rejoin the same post after release,"" underlined the functionary. He added that the 30-day timeframe is enough for the affected PM/CM/minister to apply for bail and have it heard and decided, right till the last court of appeal.","PM Narendra Modi had draft of Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025 reworked to include himself.

NEW DELHI: Even as it anchored the protest against the bill on unseating jailed ministers and CMs in the constitutional provisions, Congress claimed BJP brass was conjuring up the provision to keep a check on its two allies - CMs Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar - a political spin that struck a chord with the rest of the opposition as the issue flared up Wednesday.Rahul Gandhi said the bill takes the country back to ""medieval times"" when a king could just remove anybody at will, just for not liking somebody's face.In the thick of opposition protest on ""vote chori"", Modi govt's move on a constitutional amendment to provide for automatic dismissal of any minister who has been jailed for 30 days, initially surprised anti-BJP camp. But INDIA bloc soon concluded it was a BJP bid to ""distract"" people from ""vote chori"" that has triggered a national campaign under a united rival camp.Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""When allies like Naidu and Nitish need to be threatened... the home minister brings this dangerous bill that strikes at the heart of the constitutional principles.""The spin is not only in step with opposition's jibes post-2024 that Modi 3.0 is governing on crutches, but adds an intrigue to it. INDIA has been relishing the fact that TDP chose to write to EC on SIR in line with opposition's concerns and in defiance of BJP.It also inserts a mischief ahead of Bihar polls where BJP is aligned with JD(U).But the generic attack line, that further cements the unity among regional parties, is that BJP is looking to destabilise opposition states. Congress MP Manickam Tagore sarcastically said, ""Amid 'vote chori', this is law for 'satta chori'.""RSP MP N K Premachandran said it is Article 356, by which the Centre can dismiss a state govt, by another name.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asserted that, unlike the Congress party 's approach of placing the Prime Minister above the law, the BJP 's policy ensures that the Prime Minister, ministers, and chief ministers are subject to the rule of law.""Now, the people of the country will have to decide whether it is appropriate for a minister, chief minister, or the PM to run the govt while in jail,"" Shah posted on X.He highlighted that Narendra Modi introduced a Constitutional Amendment Bill to bring himself under the law's ambit, while the Congress-led opposition opposed it to ""remain outside the law's ambit, run govts from jail, and not relinquish their attachment to power"".""The purpose of this bill is to elevate the declining level of morality in public life and bring integrity to politics,"" Shah said. The proposed law stipulates that no person in jail can serve as PM, CM, or minister. He noted, ""When the Constitution was framed, our Constitution-makers could not have imagined that in the future, there would be political figures who would not resign on moral grounds before being arrested.Shah pointed out that, in recent years, some CMs and ministers have immorally continued governing from jail without resigning. The bills include a provision allowing an accused politician to seek bail within 30 days of arrest. Shah contrasted this with historical actions, recalling that former PM Indira Gandhi, through Constitutional Amendment No. 39, granted the Prime Minister immunity from legal action.""On the one side, this is the work culture and policy of Congress, that they place the Prime Minister above the law through constitutional amendments. On the other side, the policy of BJP is that we are bringing our govt's PM, ministers, and CMs within the ambit of law,"" he said.Shah noted that BJP and NDA upheld ethical values, citing veteran LK Advani's resignation following allegations. In contrast, he accused Congress of perpetuating an ""unethical tradition"" started by Indira Gandhi. He referred to Congress's attempt to protect RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav with an ordinance, which Rahul Gandhi opposed, yet later embraced Yadav publicly in Patna. Shah claimed this exposed the opposition's duplicity.He clarified that the bills were always intended for thorough discussion in the Joint Committee of Parliament. ""Yet, abandoning all shame and decency, entire INDI alliance, led by Congress, gathered to oppose it with crude behaviour to protect the corrupt. Today, the opposition has been completely exposed in front of the public,"" Shah said.","Amit Shah: People of the country will have to decide whether it is appropriate for a minister, chief minister, or the PM to run the govt while in jail.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has proposed exempting life and health insurance policies for individuals from the ambit of GST, the head of a panel of ministers set up by the GST council said on Wednesday, a move that is expected to provide relief to large sections of consumers.Bihar deputy chief minister and convenor of the panel of ministers on health and insurance Samrat Choudhary said the Centre's proposal is clear that individual insurance policies should be exempt from GST.""This has been discussed and the GoM report will be presented to the council,"" Choudhary was quoted as saying. He also said all members have given their approval for lowering rates and some states have given their own views. He said a final call issue would be taken by the GST council when it meets.Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, a member of the GoM , said it was made clear that the benefit of GST should go to policyholders and not companies and a mechanism needs to be worked on to ensure this. He also pointed to the fact nearly Rs 9,700 crore annual revenue loss is estimated due to the GST exemption to individual insurance policies.The 13-member panel on health and insurance was set up in Sept to draw up a roadmap on the issue and it is expected to submit its report by October.The panel includes ministers from UP, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.""The proposed reduction of GST on health and life insurance from 18% to nil (exempt) shows how GST has evolved from just a way to collect revenue to a tool for advancing national goals.

""There is a rough estimate that 45 crore people lose money every year. Total impact of the loss is estimated to be around Rs 20,000 crore,"" the source said, on a day when the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha.""Every parliamentarian has raised concerns about the ill effects of online gaming involving money. Between revenue from one-third of the industry segment and social welfare, the government has chosen welfare of society,"" the source said.The bill proposes to promote e-sports and online social gaming while banning money gaming in any form. ""There will be a budget for it, and schemes and authority for their promotion.They comprise two-thirds of the industry. It will create job opportunities for the online gaming industry,"" the source said.Action under the bill against entities involved in money gaming will be taken mainly by state govts.Any person offering an online money gaming service in violation of stipulated provisions will face imprisonment of up to three years or a fine that may extend to Rs 1 crore, or both. The provisions also stipulate imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to Rs 50 lakh, or both, for those putting out advertisements in contravention of rules.Several online real-money gaming platforms ""masquerade as game of skills"" entities to differentiate themselves from gambling or betting, the source said. ""Those who play the games are victims. They will not be punished as per the bill, but there will be action against those who provide real-money gaming platforms, facilitate transaction services, etc,"" the source said.The government has been making efforts for the last three-and-a-half years, which were being bypassed by the real-money gaming players.""Government tried to check it through GST, but it was being bypassed.

NEW DELHI: Urging fellow MPs to remember the reason behind the premature vice-presidential election, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Wednesday asked, ""where has the old VP gone"", echoing queries about Jagdeep Dhankhar's whereabouts in the wake of his absence from public view since his shock resignation exactly a month ago. He even joked that search for Dhankhar has become like ""those Agatha Christie books"".At a gathering of opposition MPs to felicitate their VP candidate B Sudershan Reddy, Rahul said there was a story behind why Dhankhar stepped down and there is a story behind ""why he is in hiding"". He said, ""Why is the (former) VP of India in a situation where he cannot say a word, one word, and has to hide... everybody knows it.... Suddenly, the person who used to burst forth in Rajya Sabha has gone silent, completely silent. So, these are the times we are living in"".Kharge framed the contest between Reddy and BJP nominee CP Radhakrishnan as ""Constitution vs RSS"". He said, ""It is an ideological battle for the soul of our nation. While the ruling party has chosen the ideology of RSS, we uphold the Constitution as our guiding light.""In an allusion to complaints the opposition had with Dhankhar as the Rajya Sabha chairman, Kharge said Reddy's nomination is a promise of restoring fairness to the functioning of the Upper House.Underlining that he keeps abreast of the parliamentary proceedings, VP nominee Reddy said, “I just remembered one quote of Lohia, ‘Jab Sadak Khamosh Hain, Sadan Aawara Banti Hain’. (When streets are silent, the parliament becomes wayward)”. He added that Rahul does not allow the streets to stay silent.In an allusion to complaints the opposition had with Dhankhar as the RS chairman, Kharge said Reddy’s nomination is a promise of restoring fairness to the functioning of the upper house and ending the transgressions against the Constitution. He said the Parliament is witnessing a growing trend of stifling opposition voices and advancing the BJP’s ideology.Claiming that there is a war between those who are attacking the Constitution and those who are defending it, Rahul said, “I happened to look inside his (Reddy’s) pocket, and to my surprise, he had a copy of the Constitution of India. He carries it everywhere. He mentioned that he has been carrying the copy for 52 years.”In the thick of the row triggered by Modi govt’s bill on unseating ministers and chief ministers jailed for 30 days, Kharge said it will be used to destabilise the state govts, especially after a “blatant misuse of parliamentary majority over 11 years to arm the autonomous agencies with draconian powers to target opposition leaders”.Congress leader KC Venugopal said the opposition will hold a mock poll on September 8 to familiarise the MPs with the voting in the VP election.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi asked, ""where has the old VP gone"" He was speaking at a gathering of opposition MPs to felicitate VP candidate B Sudershan Reddy.

All animal birth control (ABC) centres in Delhi, on Wednesday, expressed their inability to take in any more stray dogs, citing lack of kennel space and financial constraints, TOI has learnt.This was hours after an MCD officer directed NGOs running the ABC centres to start picking up ""aggressive dogs"" from vulnerable points, despite Delhi CM Rekha Gupta recently asking officials concerned to refrain from taking any ""harsh action"" against strays till the Supreme Court pronounces its final order on the issue.Seeking anonymity, ABC centre officials told TOI, ""We have informed MCD in writing that all our kennels are full. ABC centres are small and designed for only carrying out sterilisation. Not a single ABC centre in Delhi is equipped to handle long-term housing of strays.""This clearly validates the stand of protesting animal rights activists who have described the Supreme Court's Aug 11 order to remove all Delhi-NCR stray dogs to distant shelters as ""inhumane, unscientific & illegal"" and one that doesn't take into account the practical limitations of existing infra and resources.In fact, on Tuesday only, the central government informed Parliament that it intends to regulate street dog population through its ABC programme that mandates local civic bodies to catch and release strays back to their original locations post-sterilisation.The ABC rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, align with standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health and promote the ""Capture-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release method"" for humane and effective stray population management, junior animal husbandry minister SP Singh Baghel had said.","All animal birth control (ABC) centres in Delhi expressed their inability to take in any more stray dogs.

‘Dissolve Lok Sabha Immediately’: INDIA Bloc Leaders Tear Into Election Commission At Joint Presser

NEW DELHI: In a twin blow, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), asking it to disclose the source of funding for its studies on the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise and the Maharashtra Assembly polls. The council accused the institute of “deliberately… indulging in data manipulation with a deliberate and malicious action to create a narrative with intention of undermining the sanctity of the constitutional authority such as the Election Commission of India .”The action coincided with FIRs filed by Nagpur and Nashik police against Sanjay Kumar, psephologist and CSDS faculty member. Nagpur Rural Police booked him for allegedly spreading false claims of steep voter declines — 38.45% in Ramtek and 36.82% in Deolali — through now-deleted posts. SP (Rural) Harssh A Poddar said the case followed a complaint by the tehsildar, prompted by a letter from the district returning officer. Kumar has been charged under Sections 175, 353(1)(b) and 212 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and is expected to be summoned soon.In its notice, ICSSR also pressed CSDS for explanations on a string of alleged irregularities. “CSDS, Delhi has continuously been involved in various irregularities in the past and such irregularities were also reported to ICSSR in the form of multiple complaints through various channels,” it said.The violations cited include “appointment of faculty in violation of mandatory UGC regulations,” “non-holding of election of the chairman of the governing body,” “opaque method followed for appointment of director,” and “non-submission of the details of FCRA funds and its utilisation. ”The council further noted that annual accounts were not audited by CAG/AG and flagged “payment of House Rent Allowances (HRA) to employees who were staying in the government accommodation allocated to their spouses.” It said such administrative and financial lapses, combined with the controversial studies, amounted to a “gross violation of ICSSR Grant-in-Aid Rules for Societies and Institutions doing Research in the Field of Social Sciences. ”CSDS has been given seven days to respond, failing which ICSSR warned it would be “free to take appropriate action… including cancellation and withdrawal” of its grant-in-aid.Sanjay Kumar didn’t respond to messages and calls for his comments on the matter.With the police probe targeting a senior faculty member and ICSSR threatening to cut off funding, the dispute has now escalated into a high-stakes battle over credibility, accountability, and the integrity of India’s electoral processes.",The Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) issued a show cause notice to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) ICSSR asked CSDS to disclose the source of funding for its studies on the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise and the Maharashtra Assembly polls.

Noel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noel-tatas-mother-and-former-tata-group-director-simone-tata-in-critical-condition/articleshow/123375513.cms,"Simone Tata made a rare public appearance at the launch of the revamped flagship Westside store in South Mumbai in October 2019.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at the sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support. While the city faces challenges from the tariffs, its history of resilience and community pride remains strong, showing that even amidst political and economic uncertainty, Brantford continues to honor its iconic roots.In tense political times, can “The Great One” be both a Donald Trump supporter and a beloved hero in Canada? Some want him to pick a side.","Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect.

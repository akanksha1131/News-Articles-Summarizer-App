Rahul had also alleged that India had sent external affairs minister S Jaishankar to the US to get an invite for Prime Minister Narendra Modi for US President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony.Dubey also touched on the issue of the Congress MP's allegations related to his demand for caste census.""While raising these issues, Rahul Gandhi has not only shamelessly distorted the historical and substantive facts but also made an attempt to ridicule our country and lower the prestige of our Republic,"" he said, adding Birla had asked Rahul to authenticate his claims while noting that the Congress MP had not done it yet.""This 'erudite' person has neither authenticated his gibberish canards nor apologised of using the pious forum of Parliament to defame our country and the elected govt,"" the BJP MP said.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for initiating breach of privilege proceedings against Rahul Gandhi.

"Rajnath: Rahul’s remark on Army chief, China irresponsible politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-rahuls-remark-on-army-chief-china-irresponsible-politics/articleshow/117933689.cms,"NEW DELHI :

Refuting Rahul Gandhi ’s claim that the Army chief had said Chinese troops were present inside Indian territory, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday slammed the Congress MP for making “false accusations” and indulging in “irresponsible politics” on matters of national security.“The Army chief’s remarks referred only to the disturbance of traditional patrolling by both sides. He also mentioned these practices have been restored to their traditional pattern as part of the recent disengagement (in Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in Oct),” Singh said in a post on ‘X’.Noting that the words attributed to Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi “were never spoken by him at any time”, Singh added that it is “a matter of deep regret that Shri Rahul Gandhi should indulge in irresponsible politics on matters of national interest”.Speaking during the debate on the President’s address in Lok Sabha Monday, Rahul said Gen Dwivedi’s statements had contradicted PM Modi, who had denied that Chinese forces were present inside Indian territory.“The PM has denied that Chinese forces are inside our territory, but for some reason, our Army keeps talking to the Chinese about their entry into our territory and our Army chief has said the Chinese are inside our territory. This is a fact, this is not an invention,” Rahul had said.Singh also said that India, in fact, lost territory to China in the early-1960s when Jawaharlal Nehru was the PM.“If at all there is Indian territory into which China has come, this is 38,000 sq km in Aksai Chin as a result of the 1962 conflict and 5,180 sq km illegally ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963. Shri Rahul Gandhi may consider introspecting about this phase of our history,” Singh said.Speaking ahead of Army Day on Jan 15, Gen Dwivedi had said there was still “a degree of standoff” persisting between the India Army and the PLA despite the troop disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, and the two countries need to rebuild trust to de-escalate overall tensions.Gen Dwivedi said both sides have “doctored” the terrain, carried out constructions, made troop deployments and resorted to military stockings since April 2020. Consequently, there is still “a degree of standoff” in place, he said, adding that India will not reduce the number of its troops deployed along the LAC anytime soon.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh slams Congress MP for making “false accusations” and indulging in “irresponsible politics” on matters of national security.

"Annual, lifetime toll passes for use on national highways to cost Rs 3,000 & Rs 30,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/annual-lifetime-toll-passes-for-use-on-nhs-to-cost-3000-30000/articleshow/117933096.cms,"NEW DELHI: In yet another relief to the middle class and private car owners who frequently use national highways , govt is likely to soon offer the option of purchasing an ‘ annual toll pass ’ with a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 for unlimited use. It will also offer car owners the option to purchase a ‘lifetime pass’ for 15 years with an upfront payment of Rs 30,000.Sources said the proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry . TOI has also learnt that the ministry is looking at the option of tweaking the base toll rate per km for private cars to give relief to highway users. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags.At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details. This pass is priced at Rs 340 per month, that works out to Rs 4,080 for a year. “So, the offer of Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel across NH network for the entire year is much less than what people pay for free travel at one plaza. This would be optional and detailed analysis has shown that this can be a preferred choice,” said a source.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said that his ministry is working on the plan to offer passes for car owners. Sources said the ministry is looking at it as one solution to several issues, including the growing resentment against toll plazas within municipal limits, toll gates at less than 60 km interval and violence at plazas.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 55,000 crore of 2023-24, private cars had a share of barely Rs 8,000 crore. The trend of toll transaction and collection also shows that while 53% of the transactions were for private cars, their share in toll collection is barely 21%. Moreover, while nearly 60% of traffic are private vehicles at toll plazas between 6 am to 10 pm, the distribution of commercial vehicles are almost even throughout day and night.Sources said there will be no loss of earning due to the passes over a period of few years, though initially the NHAI has to forgo some revenue.","The proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry.

"PM Modi, Donald Trump likely to relaunch talks for trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-donald-trump-likely-to-relaunch-talks-for-trade-agreement/articleshow/117932804.cms,"NEW DELHI: The result of the assembly election could have a telling effect on the seat share of AAP and BJP in MCD as both the parties have nominated several sitting councillors, who, if they win, will have to resign from the civic body.The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ. In the 2022 MCD elections, AAP won 134 of the 250 seats, BJP 104, and Congress 9. Three seats went to independents.MCD is also expected to hold its mayoral election in April. AAP won the previous election by a slim margin of three votes, which was attributed to cross-voting. In such a scenario, the performance of the sitting councillors who have got assembly election tickets will become crucial in determining which party will secure the majority in the corporation.For the assembly election, BJP has nominated 12 sitting councillors and two aldermen. AAP has nominated seven councillors, including the leader of the house in MCD, Mukesh Goyal, from the Adarsh Nagar assembly constituency, and former deputy mayor Aaley Mohammad Iqbal from Matia Mahal. Congress has given a ticket to councillor Ariba Khan from the Okhla assembly constituency.The aldermen, who are experts from various fields, cannot vote in the mayoral election.One seat in the MCD is vacant for nearly a year after former BJP councillor Kamaljeet Sehrwat became the MP from Dwarka.Following defections of councillors to BJP in the last two months, the BJP's seat count in MCD has risen to 120, while AAP's tally has dropped to 122. No party has the majority. AAP has the maximum councillors.MCD officials said that it was not manadatory to conduct elections on vacant seats before conducting the mayoral election, according to the DMC Act. However, if a large number of councillors win the assembly elections, the officials said, they may ask the Election Commission to conduct bypolls in those MCD seats in March. ""We will need to have resignations from the elected candidates and then we will pursue the EC,"" an MCD official said.Among the sitting municipal councillors of BJP who got assembly election tickets are Gajendra Daral from Mundka, Priyanka Gautam from the reserved constituency of Kondli, Umang Bajaj from Naraina, Neelam Pehalwan from Najafgarh, Manoj Kumar Jindal from Sadar Bazar, Kamal Bagri from Ballimaran, Urmila Kailash Gangwal from Madipur (SC), and Anil Gaur from Seelampur. Daral won the 2022 civic election as an independent after being denied a ticket by BJP. He returned to the party within a few months. Gautam won the MCD election on an AAP ticket but joined BJP only a few months earlier.On Dec 25, AAP councillor from Ghadoli, Priyanka Gautam, joined BJP along with her supporters.KS Mehra, a former commissioner in the unified MCD, said the situation will become unstable in MCD if the majority of councillors fighting the assembly elections win. ""Already due to the standing committee, many projects are failing to get implemented. People usually complain about the non-completion of tasks, but it is difficult to explain to them the reasons every time,"" Mehra said.Trump had pledged cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what's right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in the first month of Trump's second term. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned for the PM till now. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn't ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the govt will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn't work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that will restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the two sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ has 104.

South Africa Land Confiscation: Trump Cuts Funding Over Human Rights Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/south-africa-is-confiscating-land-treating-people-very-badly-donald-trump-announces-halt-on-us-funding/articleshow/117871498.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

Bhopal’s Dr B R Ambedkar Flyover Under Scrutiny for Structural Defects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/new-flyover-goes-off-the-rails-flaws-mar-design-questions-rise-from-multiple-sides/articleshow/117866611.cms,"Bhopal: MP Public Works Department (PWD) has identified deficiencies in Dr B R Ambedkar flyover merely days after its inauguration. On Saturday, PWD and NHAI uncovered substandard quality of edge rails on both sides of the elevated corridor and took action against PWD engineers and private contractor.The newly opened PWD elevated flyover extends alongside the metro rail corridor for approximately 3 km. The timing of the PWD flyover's approval, subsequent to the metro rail project's commencement, raised questions amongst public transport advocates in the state capital.The flyover, besides the quality of construction, has several long-term design impacts. A first would be on traffic density at landing points. Second, the flyover, could have been a much needed connect between Bhopal main railway station to Ranikamlapati station. A swift entry and exit at the later has been missed by the PWD flyover.Bhopal has witnessed the construction of numerous major flyovers in the past ten years to enhance road connectivity. Two cable-stayed bridges span the Lower and Upper Lake. These structures, despite facing construction delays, lack comprehensive traffic management plans. The bridges' effectiveness has diminished due to inadequate traffic regulation and permanent blockades at connecting turns. The flyover's construction was executed by Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) through Bhopal smart city development corporation limited (BSCDCL).The Veer Savarkar bridge, connecting to Hoshangabad road and AIIMS Bhopal, features an extension that presents significant safety concerns. This narrow addition, not part of the initial design, creates a hazardous descent with minimal space for emergency vehicles and no margin for error when vehicles mistakenly ascend. BMC oversaw this flyover's construction.""Most of the flyovers that have been recently constructed in Bhopal, have largely failed to accomplish their proposed goals. Ginnori flyover is an example of how, traffic police and BMC, have eliminated gains from a flyover for decongesting traffic in the area,"" said an urban development consultant seeking anonymity.The PWD's forthright assessment, conducted with NHAI assistance, demonstrates commendable transparency in acknowledging structural concerns.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi accusing the Congress leader of speaking the language of urban Naxals. The Prime Minister also took pot shots at Rahul over his allegations of ""EAM lobbying for Trump inauguration invite"" and his ""boring"" remark for President Droupadi Murmu's Budget speech ""Today some people are openly speaking the language of urban naxals. The things that urban naxals say (are being said).

""For some people, speaking about caste is fashion. For the last 30 years, OBC MPs have been demanding that OBC Commission be granted Constitutional status. Those who see a benefit in casteism today did not think of the OBC community back then. We granted Constitutional status to the OBC Commission.

I also ask, tell me if there ever were three MPs simultaneously from the same family belonging to the ST community ... "" the PM said. He then went on to assert that there was a vast difference between the opposition's words and actions.Targeting Rahul Gandhi's allegations of external affairs minister lobbying for Trump inauguration invite, the Prime Minister took a dig at the Congress leader. 'Some think talking about foreign policy is maturity. They feel they are not mature enough if they don't talk about foreign policy, even at the cost of the nation,"" the Prime Minister said.""If they are really interested in foreign policy, they should read the book 'JFK's Forgotten Crises' that talks of Pandit Nehru's meetings with John F Kennedy to learn about foreign policy,"" he said and added: ""The book speaks of happenings in name of foreign policy when country was facing many challenges."" PM Modi attacked Rahul over his remarks calling President Murmu's speech as 'boring.' ""Those who entertain themselves by getting photo sessions done in huts of the poor will find the talk about the poor in Parliament boring,"" the Prime Minister said without naming Rahul.Soon after the President delivered her address to a joint sitting of Parliament on January 31, Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were seen discussing the speech in the Parliament complex.

A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office, Reuters reported quoting an official on Monday.The official confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India but is not expected to arrive for at least 24 hours.The US embassy spokesperson denied providing any information on the matter but added that the country was ""vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants.""""I have received a number of inquiries on reporting of a deportation flight to India. I can’t share any details on those inquiries, but I can share, on the record, that the United States is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,"" the spokesperson said.The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights. So far, the military aircraft have transported migrants to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras.Military deportation flights come at a high cost, with a recent flight to Guatemala estimated to have cost at least $4,675 per migrant, according to a Reuters report.The Indian government has signaled its willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration in identifying and repatriating its citizens residing illegally in the US, aiming to maintain strong ties and avoid a trade conflict.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case, we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India,"" he added.According to sources familiar with the matter, both nations have identified approximately 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation, though the actual number could be significantly higher, as the total remains uncertain, Bloomberg had reported last month.India accounts for a relatively small share of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens making up about 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.In contrast, Latin American nations like Mexico, Venezuela, and Guatemala contribute a much larger portion. However, the number of Indian illegal migrants has been steadily increasing, particularly at the northern US border, where they now represent nearly a quarter of all illegal crossings—the highest among migrants stopped at that entry point.While the exact total remains uncertain, a 2022 department of homeland security report estimated that approximately 2,20,000 unauthorized Indian immigrants were residing in the US.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to pay a two-day visit to the US and meet Trump starting February 12.(With inputs from agencies)","A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office.

PM Modi references JFK's Forgotten Crisis: What former CIA officer's book says about former PM Nehru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-nehru-jfk-forgotten-crisis-bruce-riedel/articleshow/117919051.cms,"JFK’s Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA, and the Sino-Indian War

Historical Context



Nehru’s Leadership During the Crisis



Nehru’s Pragmatic Turn: Seeking US Assistance



Nehru’s Legacy Post-1962



During his reply to the Motion of Thanks during the Budget Session, PM Modi made several interesting cultural references. The first involved a famous TOI cartoon by R.K. Laxman, which showed the ubiquitous “common man” dragging a float with an aeroplane carrying a group of politicians, where the pilot closely resembles former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Another reference was the bookby Bruce Riedel , a former CIA officer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The book examines the 1962 Sino-Indian War and its profound impact on US foreign policy under President John F. Kennedy.The early 1960s were marked by intense geopolitical rivalries shaped by the Cold War . The world was divided between the Western bloc, led by the United States, and the Eastern bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union, with newly independent nations like India trying to carve out a neutral space through the Non-Aligned Movement. Nehru was one of the movement’s key architects, advocating for peaceful coexistence and diplomatic engagement rather than aligning with either superpower.However, China’s rise as a communist power under Mao Zedong presented new challenges. After the 1949 Communist Revolution, China became increasingly assertive in its foreign policy, particularly concerning territorial disputes. The relationship between India and China, once symbolised by the slogan ""Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai"" (India and China are brothers), deteriorated due to border disagreements, especially in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh . The situation was further complicated by India’s asylum to the Dalai Lama following the 1 959 Tibetan uprising, which strained Sino-Indian relations.Amid these tensions, the world witnessed other critical events: the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded in October 1962, bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was during this volatile period that the Sino-Indian War erupted, creating a parallel crisis that is often overshadowed in historical narratives.Riedel’s book paints a nuanced portrait of Nehru, depicting both his visionary ideals and the strategic miscalculations that contributed to India’s unpreparedness for the 1962 war. Nehru’s foreign policy was rooted in moral diplomacy, non-alignment, and the belief that India could maintain peaceful relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs. However, JFK’s Forgotten Crisis argues that Nehru’s idealism left him blindsided to the realpolitik of China’s territorial ambitions.Riedel critiques Nehru’s overreliance on diplomacy, which led to complacency in addressing the growing military threat from China. Despite intelligence reports and clear signs of Chinese aggression along the Himalayan border, Nehru underestimated the likelihood of an armed conflict. When the People’s Liberation Army launched a surprise, well-coordinated offensive in October 1962, Indian forces were ill-prepared, poorly equipped, and unfamiliar with high-altitude warfare.The war was a personal and political blow to Nehru. It exposed the weaknesses of India’s defence policy and shattered his belief in the power of diplomacy to resolve conflicts with authoritarian regimes. Riedel describes how the defeat deeply affected Nehru’s morale and public image, as he faced criticism both domestically and internationally for India’s lack of preparedness.One of the pivotal moments Riedel highlights is Nehru’s decision to seek military assistance from the United States. This was a significant shift, as Nehru had previously maintained a distance from the US, wary of its Cold War alliances and interventionist policies. The crisis forced Nehru to prioritise national security over ideological consistency, demonstrating his capacity to adapt under pressure.Nehru’s appeal to President John F. Kennedy marked an unprecedented moment in Indo-US relations. Despite being preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy responded swiftly, recognising India’s strategic importance as a democratic counterbalance to communist China in Asia. The US provided military aid, including weapons, ammunition, and logistical support, which helped stabilise India’s defence capabilities in the immediate aftermath of the conflict.Riedel notes that although Nehru’s request for help was born out of desperation, it laid the groundwork for a brief period of closer Indo-US ties. The personal rapport between Nehru and Kennedy grew during this time, with Kennedy’s quick response helping to bridge the ideological divide between the two leaders. However, the momentum was short-lived following Kennedy’s assassination in 1963.While JFK’s Forgotten Crisis critiques Nehru’s missteps, it also acknowledges his role in steering India through the aftermath of the war. The defeat catalysed major reforms in India’s defence policy, including a significant military build-up and a strategic reassessment of foreign relations. Nehru oversaw these changes, recognising the need for a stronger military to complement India’s diplomatic efforts.Riedel argues that the 1962 crisis was a turning point not just for India, but for global geopolitics. For Nehru, it was a harsh lesson in the limits of idealism in international relations. The war forced him to confront the complexities of power politics, balancing India’s moral principles with the pragmatic demands of national security.","Nehru’s appeal to President John F. Kennedy marked an unprecedented moment in US-India relations. Kennedy responded swiftly, recognising China as a democratic power in Asia. The crisis forced Nehru to prioritise national security over ideological consistency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117919179,imgsize-1427986,width-400,resizemode-4/117919179.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , while responding to the Motion of Thanks debate in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, invoked a famous RK Laxman cartoon that appeared in The Times of India to critique past leadership, drawing laughter from NDA MPs and sharp reactions from the opposition.Recalling the illustration, PM Modi described how it depicted an airplane—symbolizing grand ambitions—placed on a wooden cart being puled by the 'common man'. The words ""21st century"" were written on it, yet the plane remained grounded. ""At the time, it seemed like a joke, but later, it proved to be true,"" he remarked, suggesting that previous governments were disconnected from reality.Without naming him, PM Modi took an indirect dig at former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and said, ""There was one PM who used to continuously speak about the 21st century... At that time, RK Laxman made a very interesting cartoon. That cartoon was funny back then, but later, it became the truth.

The work that should have been done decades ago is happening now. That’s why when the public gave us a chance, we focused on youth development and nation-building.""The remarks were widely interpreted as a dig at former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who frequently spoke about modernizing India in the 1980s.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Prataprao Jadhav informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that 59 cases of HMPV and two deaths due to co-morbidities were reported between January 6 and 29, according to the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP). The cases include 17 from Tamil Nadu, 11 from Gujarat, and nine from Puducherry, Jadhav stated in a written reply.Young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are more prone to the virus, causing respiratory illnesses that vary from mild cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia.According to minister of state for health Jadhav, the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been present worldwide since 2001 and there hasn't been a notable increase in instances of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or influenza like illness (ILI) anywhere in the nation.He added that the union health ministry has implemented a number of initiatives to track and control the spread of HMPV cases as well as raise public awareness about HMPV symptoms and strategies.The Indian council for medical research (ICMR) sentinel surveillance data also confirmed no unusual rise in ILI or SARI cases across the country, Jadhav stated.Outlining the measures taken to control HMPV, he said that the Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been operational since January 6, 2025, to monitor the HMPV situation regularly.A daily situational report (SitRep) is shared with relevant stakeholders. In order to test and sequence any positive respiratory samples from hospitalized SARI cases, states and union territories have been advised to remain attentive and transmit them to authorized virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs), said Jadhav. He added, India already has a strong ILI and SARI surveillance infrastructure in place via the ICMR and IDSP networks.States have been advised to strengthen information, education, and communication (IEC) efforts to raise awareness about preventing the transmission of the virus through simple measures like washing hands with soap and water.The states are advised to cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, avoid close contact with those who are displaying symptoms of the sickness, and refrain from touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.The government conducted a nationwide preparedness drill, confirming that the health system is adequately equipped to handle the seasonal rise in respiratory illnesses, Jadhav said.The situation of respiratory illnesses in India and the status regarding HMPV cases were reviewed in a number of meetings with various stakeholders at the level of secretary (health and family welfare), director general of health services, and joint monitoring group, he said.The stakeholders are department of health research, DGHS, health secretaries and officials of states, experts from the integrated disease surveillance platform (IDSP), NCDC, Indian council of medical research (ICMR), national institute of virology (NIV) and state surveillance units of IDSP.He advised the states to review and improve ILI/SARI surveillance.One of the several respiratory viruses that can infect people of all ages is the HMPV, especially in the winter and early spring. Coughing, runny nose, fever, sore throat, and dyspnea are some of the symptoms.The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own, the minister said.Jadhav informed that the majority of patients heal on their own and that the viral infection is often a mild and self-limiting disease.","59 cases of HMPV and two deaths due to co-morbidities were reported between January 6 and 29.

But, this expectation of us was also not met in Parliament.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi, replying to the Motion of Thanks debate in the Lok Sabha criticised the Gandhi family, including leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Criticising the past Congress governments in a veiled reference, the PM said, ""We had a PM, he wanted to be called Mr Clean, he understood the problem. He said if Rs1 leaves Delhi then only 15 paisa reaches the poor. Only one party ruled in states and the centre. This was pure loot, a very big 'haath safai'.""Contrasting it with the efforts of the current government, he mentioned the initiative, ""JAM Trinity,"" which links Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhar cards, and Mobile numbers to give direct benefit transfers to people.Meanwhile, he hit out at Sonia Gandhi for her remarks on the President, ""After the President's address, someone from a poor family, another woman could not respect the President. But she is being insulted by saying all sorts of things. I can understand political frustration but against the President? What is the reason?""",Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra claimed that PM Modi's speech reflected that he has lost his connection with people and their needs.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also attacked PM Modi and termed his address as an election speech.

"PM Modi set to travel to US, meet Donald Trump on February 13",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-set-to-travel-to-us-meet-donald-trump-on-feb-13/articleshow/117898606.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will travel to Washington from Paris on February 12 for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump after the latter’s inauguration last month. His official engagements are scheduled to take place over the next 2 days, with the summit likely on February 13.Modi will travel to France next week to co-chair an AI summit that President Emmanuel Macron is hosting on February 10-11. While Trump too had been invited for the summit, the US is likely to be represented in the meeting by Vice President JD Vance.With Trump not travelling to Paris, the bilateral summit with Modi will now take place in the US capital. Trump in fact had confirmed last week, after a phone conversation with the PM, that he would be visiting the White House in February.In what was their first conversation since the January 20 inauguration, Trump had raised the 2 possible sticking points in ties - trade and illegal immigration - while pledging cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what’s right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in only the first month of Trump’s second term. Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned till now for the PM to participate in. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn’t ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the government will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn’t work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that would restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the 2 sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","PM Narendra Modi will travel to Washington from Paris on February 12 for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump after the latter’s inauguration last month.

Trump’s USAID Funding Halt to Impact India’s Health and Education Sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-usaid-funds-freeze-set-to-hit-india-health-education-projects-hard/articleshow/117898469.cms,"Poll What Will Be the Biggest Impact of USAID's Suspension of Work in India? Setback for Education, Gender, and Climate Change Initiatives Disruption of Health-Related Programs and Services

NEW DELHI: Following the issuance of an executive order by President Donald Trump to review US foreign assistance and align them with the policies of the new administration, US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work until further notice. The move has raised concerns among those engaged with USAID-funded projects in India.The biggest impact is expected on health-related programmes where USAID funds have been seen to have bolstered technical support to grassroots-level outreach. Other sectors where impacts going forward are likely to be felt include education, gender and climate change. Though USAID has a small footprint in India, the prospect of its engagement shrinking further comes at a time when global aid has considerably dropped, and can compound the financial troubles facing NGOs in development.USAID's directive to partners including voluntary organisations and agencies steering projects for govts, make it clear that they must minimise expenditure on the collaborations during the pause period. ""The recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer (USAID) that this award suspension has been cancelled,"" the directive states. It is learnt from sources in the development sector that the 'stop work' orders come with the caveat of a 90-day period during which the existing grants will be reviewed.""But the uncertainty is causing panic,"" a development practitioner said on conditions of anonymity while asserting that her organisation is able to continue work as there are other donors.According to the USAID website, as of Jan 2021, the agency was supporting mother and child health initiatives in six states with a focus on improving maternal and child health services. It was also funding initiatives to improve health by advancing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in several cities, and in addition to this, partnered with states and private agencies to support programmes preventing gender-based violence and protecting and supporting the disabled population.According to development sector professionals, the civil society has already been feeling the heat of a funds crunch with sources of global aid slowly drying up over the decades. Moreover, the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act restrictions in recent years have made it harder for local organisations to get foreign donations.Harsh Jaitli, CEO of Voluntary Action Network India, which is a network of 600 civil society organisations, said USAID pause on funding is part of a larger global trend with big agencies from Sweden, Germany and UK cutting down on aid to countries.However, smaller civil society organisations working at the grassroots level largely remain unimpacted by the USAID directive as the agency support is largely seen in big programmes like combating tuberculosis and outreach on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). According to those working in the sector, since 2004, USAID has been largely supporting technical work on the projects steered by govts.","US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work.

When the main response to 100+ pages of evidence (presented in the report against Adani Group) is a goofy conspiracy, we view it as a sign that we were right on the mark.""He dismissed claims of sharing reports with hedge funds saying, ""We have always maintained full editorial control over all of our research.""""As we and many other US-based short sellers have discussed in public interviews for years, our model involves investing our own capital and sometimes also bringing on a balance sheet partner.

Will halt coal mining if Rs 1.4 lakh crore dues not cleared: Soren to Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-halt-coal-mining-if-rs-1-4-lakh-crore-dues-not-cleared-soren-to-centre/articleshow/117929521.cms,"RANCHI: In a stern warning to the Centre , Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday said his govt would take tough measures, including taking a legal recourse and forcing public sector coal units operating out of the state to shut down their mining operations, if no sincere efforts were made to clear its coal-related dues.Speaking at JMM's 53rd foundation day function in Dhanbad, Hemant said, ""We have been getting step-brotherly treatment for centuries, and this has to stop now. If we take a tough step, then the whole country will plunge into darkness.""""Our coal-related dues are to the tune of Rs 1.36 lakh crore. Whenever we demanded our share, the Centre said there were no outstanding dues. Even their MPs from the state remain tight-lipped in Parliament,"" he alleged.Hemant also revealed that Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy had asked him during their meeting last month to slash the price of land that needed to be acquired by coal companies for mining. ""He told me that our rates are higher than other states and we must slash the rates. I refused and told him that if they were interested, they would have to acquire land at existing rates,"" he added.The chief minister also announced that his govt would soon be launching a massive crackdown on the nexus of land sharks and government officials in shady land deals across the state. ""All BDOs (block development officers) and COs (circle officers), who are hand-in-glove with the land sharks, will be arrested and put in jail, and would be removed from service,"" Soren warned.","Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said his govt would take tough measures, including taking a legal recourse and forcing public sector coal units operating out of the state to shut down their mining operations.

"Abujmarh has fallen, no longer a Red citadel, says surrendered top Maoist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abujmarh-has-fallen-no-longer-a-red-citadel-says-surrendered-top-maoist/articleshow/117928752.cms,"GADCHIROLI : The once-unassailable Maoist headquarters in Abujmarh - spread across the rugged, forested hills straddling Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh - has fallen to security forces after 50 years of bloodshed. A fact conceded by Giridhar, a former commander of PLGA, during a conversation with TOI Tuesday.""Abujmarh is no longer an impregnable Red citadel. The liberated zones have been smashed, commandos are conquering every inch of Dandakaranya jungles. Maoist cadre base has been practically wiped out,"" said the guerrilla combat strategist, who surrendered in June last year and now resides at Gadchiroli police HQ with his wife Sangita.Giridhar, who once helmed seven dalams in Gadchiroli for 28 years, saw the movement decline first-hand. ""There was a spark, a vision, and an ideology. But in today's world, change can only be ushered through democracy. Why should one tribal kill another - one in uniform, the other a Naxal? Meaningless killings find no place in history,"" he said.Once a key architect of Maoist expansion, Giridhar had masterminded the 2009 ambush that killed Rajnandgaon SP Vinod Choubey. With 185 cases against him, he was instrumental in shoehorning villagers into the guerrilla force, even as younger generations drifted toward urban aspirations.""Our cadre base was fast depleting. Police seemed friendlier with their civic actions, freebies, jobs, and promise of a better life. With education and the lure of urban dazzle, nobody wanted to join us. The youth did not want to die with a police bullet in their head,"" he said.Giridhar's surrender turned the wheels of Maharashtra's anti-Maoist operations, leading to the elimination of senior members like Milind Teltumbde, Rupesh, and Bhaskar Hichami. His exit was followed by over 30 cadres returning to the mainstream.Maoists' undoing was a dovetailing of police aggression and govt outreach. ""After Union minister Amit Shah's call to wipe us out by 2026, we knew our days were numbered. Security forces' nightly operations, cordons, and carpet bombings left us clueless,"" added Giridhar, who narrowly escaped death twice.While Maoism in Gadchiroli is gasping for air, top leaders like Hidma, Bhupathi alias Sonu, and Prabhakar - the current Gadchiroli Maoist chief - are continuing to hold out. Giridhar cautioned against writing its obituary just yet. ""The ideology may again revive with one good leader rising up against displacement, exploitation, ostracism, and suppression. Don't take any situation for granted.""",Maoists' undoing was a dovetailing of police aggression and govt outreach. Giridhar masterminded the 2009 ambush that killed Rajnandgaon SP Vinod Choubey.

If it were so, the outbreak would typically follow a point-source epidemic pattern. This means cases would be linked to a common food source, with a clear history of consumption from a specific place, and cases would appear within the expected incubation period.""At least 87 cases were within a 5km radius of the contamination zone.

Tigress in 'boar' well: Prey and hunter's joint survival tale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-in-boar-well-prey-and-hunters-joint-survival-tale/articleshow/117928086.cms,"BHOPAL: Panchtantra met Jungle Book in the forests of Seoni , Madhya Pradesh, when a tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit. Trapped in a battle for survival, both the hunter and hunted treaded the water together, often rubbing against each other in the closed confines.The two mostly faced away from each other. The tigress probably realised predation was pointless if it couldn't eat the kill. The boar, with nowhere to run, followed the predator's lead, even leaning on it when tired. Both were rescued by evening by forest officials with some jungle jugaad . Thereafter, each went its own way.Fittingly, this drama played out in the forest that was the setting for Kipling's 'Jungle Book'. Mowgli's Seoni is in Pench national park , around 400km from Bhopal. Villagers of Piparia Harduli, in Jikurai forest area, were in for a shock when they made their morning walk to the well to fetch water - a tigress and a boar were looking up at them. The tigress, exhausted from swimming, was visibly tired but remained calm. The boar would struggle from time to time just to stay afloat, trembling more from its proximity to the tigress than the cold water.Villagers alerted forest office. Kurai forest range assistant Shariq Khan got the call. A team from Pench tiger reserve, along with police, arrived on the scene and realised that there was no manual for such a rescue and they had to come up with some jugaad.The well was roped off to keep villagers well away from the scene of operation. Foresters worked out a system of ropes and tackles and used a JCB and a hydraulic crane to lower a cot and a cage into the well. The tigress lunged at it, and grabbed on to it, roaring, growling and refusing to let go. Foresters knew the cot would break under the tigress' weight and tried to push it away with a stick. The tigress snarled and roared and swiped at the stick, but it eventually got the message and went back into the water. When the cage was lowered, with its trapdoor open, the tigress attacked it. It took a while to understand that the metal beast wasn't going to swallow it and gingerly climbed into it, to cheers from the rescue team. The trapdoor fell shut.The boar, meanwhile, had realised that the cot was meant for it and climbed on to it. Both animals were pulled to safety. The boar was released back into the forest. The tigress, believed to be about three years old, will be released in Nauradehi sanctuary of Veerangana Durgavati tiger reserve in Sagar.","A tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit.

Delhi election voting time: 7am to 6pm- 11 hours that will matter for 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-2025-7am-to-6pm-11-hours-that-will-matter-for-5-years/articleshow/117927947.cms,"Also Read:

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for a gripping three-way contest that will not only shape the future of the capital but also determine the political fate of its three main contenders.More than 1.5 crore eligible voters will have the chance to choose their representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly from a pool of 699 candidates - 603 men, 95 women and a third-gender person - who have campaigned vigorously over the past two weeks. The polling booths will open at 7am and voting will continue till 6pm.The last two assembly elections were one-sided with AAP winning two huge mandates. BJP could barely manage to mark its presence in the assembly and Congress was almost decimated. In 2015, AAP romped home with 54.6% vote share and a record 67 seats with the remaining three going to BJP. The 2020 assembly elections saw AAP's vote share and seats drop only marginally to 53.6% and 62, respectively. BJP won the remaining eight seats and Congress failed to open its account yet again.The three political parties are engaged in a fierce electoral battle once again and have spared no effort in wooing the electorate. Most of the promises made in their election manifestos have a similar ring.Several seats are going to witness a keen contest this time. While AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal is facing a stiff challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both former MPs from different constituencies in different years, CM Atishi is pitted against BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri, another former MP, and Congress's Alka Lamba.As the city votes today, several contests would be closely watched, among them former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who has shifted from Patparganj to Jangpura, where BJP's Tarvinder Singh Marwah and Congress's Farhad Suri are his two main rivals. In Ballimaran, there is a keen contest between Congress heavyweight and former minister Haroon Yusuf and incumbent AAP minister Imran Hussain.Greater Kailash, Malviya Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Mangolpuri, Patparganj and Matia Mahal are some of the other seats of immense consequence this time.AAP has promised a number of new welfare schemes, which, it claims, will help families make huge savings. It has showcased free electricity and water provided to frugal consumers and free travel for women in public buses as some of its schemes which, along with ""good education and health"", have helped each household make a monthly saving of nearly Rs 25,000. The party has also claimed that a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free treatment for senior citizens and free travel for students in buses will save another Rs 10,000.While promising to continue the schemes run by the AAP-led Delhi govt, BJP - which has not won a single assembly election in Delhi after 1993 - has promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 to women besides increasing the pension for senior citizens; implementation of the Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme for senior citizens; a monthly pension for small traders and entrepreneurs; paid internship for the youth; and a gas cylinder at Rs 500 for the poor.For Congress, it is a matter of survival and staying relevant in city politics. Its campaign was aimed at wresting at least a section of its vote bank from AAP. The party has assured Rs 8,500 per month to the unemployed for a year; Rs 2,500 a month for women under 'Pyari Didi Yojana'; an insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh every year; and zero bills for consumers using up to 300 units, if it elected to office.A bitter campaign that ended on Monday saw AAP, BJP and Congress hurl allegations at each other. Regular representations were made by all three parties to EC, accusing each other of violating the model code of conduct. Interestingly, all three parties this time have an exclusive focus on Poorvanchalis, who form almost one-fourth of the total vote share. Not only have the three parties given tickets to several candidates from the region, BJP has even allied with political parties of Bihar - Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Paswan) - and allocated them one seat each.The Delhi election office, meanwhile, has promised a ""free and fair"" poll in the city. According to chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz, nearly 1.1 lakh civil officials - polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers - and 60,000 security personnel have been deployed.There are nearly 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 lakh women eligible to cast their votes on Wednesday at 13,766 polling booths spread across 2,696 locations across the city.Vaz added that 21,584 ballot units, 20,692 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been procured to conduct the polls. ""A paid holiday has been declared for employees working in govt and private sectors as well as for those employed in shops and commercial establishments. This move, aimed at facilitating voter participation, also applies to voters from bordering states, UP and Haryana, who are employed in Delhi,"" Vaz said.While voting will take place till 6pm, Vaz said all voters standing in a queue at 6pm will be allowed to cast their vote. ""ECI has issued clear directives, prohibiting the use of mobile phones, cameras, smartwatches and any other electronic items inside the polling stations,"" Vaz said.The CEO said that all polling stations will be closely monitored by her office and also by the offices of the district election officers through webcasting.","More than 1.5 crore eligible voters will have the chance to choose their representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly.

Many countries became developed in 20-25 years and since we have democracy, demography and demand, we have to move on with this dream till 2047.""Rahul had Monday alleged that Modi sent external affairs minister S Jaishankar to the US to wangle an invite for inauguration of Donald Trump as US president as part of his larger narrative of incompetence against Modi govt. The PM did not respond to the specific charge which Jaishankar had already refuted but referred to J K Galbraith's recollection of first PM Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to the US during John F Kennedy's presidency, terming it as the ""worst state visit"".Galbraith was a close aide of former US president JFK and a renowned public servant who served as ambassador to India.""These days, people seek to talk about foreign policy. That is seen as a sign of maturity. Such people should read 'JFK's Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA and the Sino-Indian War'. Only then will you get to know what transpired under the cloak of diplomacy,"" Modi said, referring to details of Galbraith's unflattering account of Nehru's engagements in Washington DC as told to former US diplomat and CIA analyst Bruce Riedel.It was one of Modi's least-interrupted speeches in recent times in Lok Sabha as the entire opposition was in attendance and the speech concluded without any noticeable protests or objections by opposition parties.Modi, however, deployed his trademark blend of aggression and subtlety. He suggested that Rahul's claim to be a custodian of the interests of SCs/STs and OBCs did not square with the entitlements that came with his elite background. ""How many SCs/STs and OBCs have had three members simultaneously serving as MPs?"" he asked, alluding to Sonia and Priyanka also being MPs. He criticised Sonia for her ""poor thing"" remark about Murmu. ""After the President's address - a woman President, the daughter of a poor family - if you cannot respect her, it is up to you. But what all is being said to insult her? What is the reason?"" he said.The PM once again took on the allegation that BJP under him was out to subvert the Constitution. ""There are some people who are strutting around with copies of the Constitution stuffed in their pockets. But we are the ones who have internalised the Constitution and act accordingly,"" he said.In a not-so-veiled allusion to Congress' recent pitch for caste census, he said ""it has become a fashion for some leaders to talk of castes"".Modi invoked his own humble background to assert that when a person, who is connected to the ground, understands the ground reality and spends his life for the poor, then changes follow.""One who has lived that kind of life knows what it means to have a house with a proper roof. Pain of poor, troubles of common man cannot be understood just like that; it requires passion and some just don't have it,"" he said.","PM Modi accuses Rahul Gandhi of using ""the language of urban Naxals openly"" He also took exception to Rahul's remark terming Droupadi Murmu's speech unexciting.

They are an assault on the values of equality and human dignity that Ireland holds dear.""The Embassy emphasised that Irish society rejected racism and xenophobia, stating that the actions of a small group do not represent the Irish people's true nature and will not be accepted.Regarding the Indian community's impact, the statement noted, ""Over 100,000 Indians now call Ireland home.

Compared to the compassionate, the wicked are “fortunate” —

They carry no weight of remorse in their hearts.

It was not the crime that first unsettled me — it was the nail polish on her fingers.Neat, with a kind of professional perfection.But here was Abirami — standing trial for killing her two young children — with the composure of someone on a casual outing, not a courtroom that might condemn her for life .Seven years ago, when the case broke, my thoughts went first to her children. Even if they saw their mother adding something to their milk, they would have drunk it. Why would a child suspect their mother of harming them?The court found her and her lover guilty of murder. Yet the case felt like more like a warning than a domestic tragedy — of how the lure of illicit relationships and fantasy, amplified by platforms like TikTok (not banned when the crime happened), can erode moral fibres already tattering. For Abirami, elopement wasn’t enough — she wanted to erase every tie that bound her to her existing life. So, she poisoned her children.In nature, some animals kill their young — to spare the weak, to conserve resources. But evolution attunes most species toward nurturing, not destruction. Monkeys — our closest kin — do not practise infanticide. Which makes maternal filicide in humans not just rare, but chilling.Psychologists trace its motives thus:: a suicidal mother saves her child from a motherless life: driven by hallucinations or delusions: the child is killed to take revenge on the father: the child is an obstacleAbirami’s motive lay in the coldest category — the child as hindrance.On the day of verdict, the judge pronounced the sentence – life imprisonment for both. That image stayed with me — the woman waiting for judgement — her hair neatly tied, her face composed. No tremor of guilt . No eyes hollowed by remorse . She cried only when the punishment was pronounced. She asked for mercy — which she never showed her children.Mothers are considered protectors, who don’t eat, sleep or even comb their hair for weeks if their child is unwell. Think of Manisha Kachhadiya, who in the recent Air India IC171 crash in Ahmedabad, shielded her eight‑month‑old son from the flames with her own body, later donating her skin to save him, again. Her instincts were pure, reflexive — child before self.Abirami stood at the opposite pole. Evil isn’t effortless. Yet some do it — and live on, as though nothing happened.Perhaps they have what psychologists call— two selves coexisting:One, the rational self that walks, talks, and performs the social dance.The other, hidden and dark, driven by lust, desire, hatred, or greed.The mind capable of such cruelty is not always broken; sometimes it is calculating — able to measure gestures of grace with the same precision it measures out poison. It can hold two worlds within itself: one that functions in the day, of socialisation, and another that thrives in the night, untouched by empathy.Valluvar saw this long ago. In1072, he speaks with bitter clarity:And so, they walk on, their pulse even — carrying the quietest death of all: a soul untouched by guilt.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Army-IAF launch another hunt for 200 light choppers to replace old Cheetahs & Chetaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeks-200-copters-to-replace-ageing-cheetah-chetak-fleet/articleshow/123196628.cms,"From Crown Jewel To Flying Coffin: IAF To Phase Out Iconic Mig-21 Fighter Jets After 62 Years

NEW DELHI: India has once again resumed the hunt to replace its old single-engine Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, which lack modern avionics, in-built safety mechanisms and have been dogged by a high crash rate just like the MiG-21 fighters, causing the death of scores of pilots over the years.The Army on Friday issued a request for information (RFI) to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters (RSHs) and another 80 for the IAF. “The defence ministry intends to urgently replace the fleet of existing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters with suitable light helicopters of modern design,” the RFI said.The RSHs should be able to perform surveillance by day and night, transport small number troops for special missions, carry internal and external loads in support of ground operations and perform a “scout role” in conjunction with attack helicopters, the RFI added.The armed forces have been demanding new light helicopters to replace their around 350 Cheetah and Chetak choppers, which are of the design vintage of the 1960s, for well over two decades now. They have sounded the alarm several times but to no avail till now, as reported by TOI earlier.Defence officials told TOI the 200 RSHs will add to the 187 (Army 126, IAF 61) light utility helicopters (LUHs), in the 3-tonne class, being built by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) in another long-delayed project.Progressive induction of these new LUHs will see the Army finally begin to retire its old Cheetahs and Chetaks from 2027 onwards, with the entire retirement-induction plan taking around a decade, an officer said. A separate `Make in India’ project for 60 Utility Helicopter-Marines for the Navy, incidentally, is also yet to take off.It’s, however, very early days for the RSHs. The Army itself said the RFI has been issued to finalise staff qualitative requirements, decide the procurement category and identify probable vendors, including Indian companies forming joint ventures or production arrangements with foreign original equipment manufacturers.While the Cheetahs and Chetaks have certainly been the workhorses of the 14-lakh strong armed forces, especially in high-altitude and forward areas, they have also grappled with poor serviceability and maintainability.The Cheetahs lack modern avionics and glass cockpits that assist in stability augmentation and build better situational awareness for the pilots to operate in low visibility and bad weather conditions.Officials are keeping their fingers crossed this time. For instance, the inter-governmental agreement inked with Russia in 2015 for 200 twin-engine Kamov-226T choppers for Army (135) and IAF (65) in a `Make in India’ project worth around $2 billion, eventually failed to take off due to pricing and other issues.","The Army on Friday issued a request for information to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters.

"“Put yourself in uncomfortable situations,” says Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 8 important career lessons that professionals must learn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/put-yourself-in-uncomfortable-situations-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-here-are-important-career-lessons-to-learn/articleshow/123178194.cms,"Be your own toughest critic



Seek out the people who intimidate you



Lean into discomfort



Let passion guide your decisions



Build mission-oriented teams



Trust before you criticise



Let recognition come naturally



Remember that wealth is only part of the story



Corporate boardrooms rarely produce leaders who combine quiet humility with the strategic acumen to steer a $2.3 trillion enterprise. Sundar Pichai is one of those rare exceptions. His ascent from a product manager’s desk in 2004 to the CEO’s chair at Google is not a story of brash manoeuvres, but of measured choices, deliberate growth, and an unyielding focus on people.At 52, with a personal fortune of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Pichai stands as proof that leadership excellence is not defined by volume or theatrics, but by clarity of vision and consistency of execution. In a candid exchange with Lex Fridman, American Computer Scientist and podcaster, he offered a distilled set of principles, drawn from two decades at the helm of one of the world’s most influential companies, that hold deep relevance for anyone seeking professional and personal advancement.These lessons are not abstract platitudes. They are field-tested convictions forged through moments of uncertainty, challenge, and relentless innovation. For those willing to absorb them, they serve as a blueprint for growing beyond limitations and leading with purpose.Pichai’s most telling insight lies in his belief that the best professionals need no external reprimand to recognise their missteps. “At times, you're working with people who are so committed to achieving, if they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do,” he remarked.The essence: Hold yourself to a standard higher than any imposed by a manager.Far from shying away from professional discomfort, Pichai considers it an essential growth tool. “At various points in my life, I've worked with people who I felt were better than me,” he admitted. The takeaway? Surround yourself with talent that challenges your competence and compels you to stretch your own abilities.For Pichai, growth rarely blossoms in the safe zone. He urges young professionals to “put yourself in uncomfortable situations” because “often you'll surprise yourself.” That willingness to step into the unfamiliar is what propelled him from a product manager’s desk to the helm of Google in just over a decade.In an age when career decisions are often algorithmically calculated, Pichai champions an instinctive approach. “When you do things, I think it's important to listen to your heart, and see whether you actually enjoy doing it,” he advised. Passion, he argues, is a more reliable long-term compass than expediency.A single leader cannot steer a global enterprise without the right people in place. Pichai’s formula for high performance is simple but uncompromising: “You find mission-oriented people who are in the shared journey, who have this inner drive to excellence, to do the best, and motivate people, and you can achieve a lot that way.”Pichai’s calm management style is grounded in faith in his teams. While he recognises that “occasionally, there are people who you need to clearly let them know, like, ‘That wasn't okay,’” he is quick to add, “I've often found that not to be the case.” His approach reflects a belief that empowered and committed employees self-correct more effectively than those micromanaged.Pichai’s rise to CEO was not the result of orchestrated self-promotion, but the by-product of consistent excellence. His work caught the attention of Larry Page and Sergey Brin precisely because it spoke for itself—a quiet reminder that recognition earned organically is the most enduring.Despite his billionaire status, Pichai’s net worth is modest in comparison to Google’s co-founders, whose fortunes exceed $160 billion each according to US media reports. Yet his focus remains fixed on impact, influence, and innovation, an implicit lesson that personal wealth is only one metric of success.Pichai’s philosophy is deceptively simple yet deeply profound: Growth begins where comfort ends, excellence thrives in self-discipline, and success is amplified by the people you choose to work with. For those willing to follow his lead, the results can be transformative.","Sundar Pichai, 52, is the CEO of Google and worth an estimated $1.1 billion.

Israel approves plan to take control of Gaza, military begins troop build-up near border

Today's evening news wrap includes updates on national politics, foreign affairs, business and international security. An SBI report revealed that India's fuel bill may rise by $ 12 billion in FY27 if it stops Russian oil. Centre withdrew Income Tax Bill in Lok Sabha and the new Bill is set to be introduced on August 11. The Election Commission has asked Rahul Gandhi to sign declaration on ""vote chori"" claim. Meanwhile, the US reiterated its ""direct involvement"" claim in India-Pakistan ceasefire. Israel approved plan to take control of Gaza City.According SBI analysis, discontinuing Russian oil imports for the remainder of FY26 could result in a $9 billion increase in the fuel bill during FY26, whilst FY27 might witness an escalation of $11.7 billion owing to price rises.Since 2022, India has sharply increased purchases of discounted Russian oil, priced under a $60-per-barrel cap. The move, adopted after Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion, was aimed at bolstering the country’s energy security amid shifting global supply lines.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.

The three CEOs had expected him to submit the documents along with the declaration on Thursday itself but are still waiting. During a meeting with Karnataka PCC chief DK Shivakumar on Friday, the state CEO sought a similar declaration from him.Justifying the condition placed on Rahul to submit details of the alleged roll irregularities under oath, before it initiates further proceedings, the EC officer explained: ""Rahul has never signed any complaint made to EC. Whatever reply the commission has been giving is to some other entity from AICC, giving him scope to disown it later"".EC on Friday also rejected Rahul's fresh charge on non-functioning of EC website.""It's functioning seamlessly since its launch,"" it said and added that e-roll for all states can be downloaded from the website.Another EC functionary pointed out that Rahul had, at his press conference, repeated a ""tired"" script. On his demand that EC share the electoral roll in a ""machine-readable format"", the officer cited SC's rejection of a similar prayer by Congress' Kamal Nath in 2018.""In 2018, they tried to mislead SC by producing documents from a private website to demonstrate that the roll showed the same face for 36 voters. In reality, the defects were rectified four months before that and a copy of the corrected roll was supplied to the party.

SC to examine validity of BNS 'sedition' provision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-examine-validity-of-bns-sedition-provision/articleshow/123196299.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the 'sedition' provision in Section 152 of BNS and tagged the petition on this issue to pending petitions that challenged the validity of Section 124A of IPC.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by retired Maj Gen S G Vombatkere, who alleged that BNS Section 152 was merely a rewording of the sedition provision defined in IPC Section 124A, which had the maximum penalty of life sentence.In a PIL filed through advocate Prasanna S, he said, ""Section 152 of BNS reintroduces the colonial sedition law, Section 124A of IPC. Though the language is altered, its substantive content - criminalising vague and broad categories of speech and expression such as 'subversive activity', 'encouragement of separatist feelings', and acts 'endangering unity or integrity of India' - remains the same or is even more expansive. "" He was among petitioners who challenged the validity of the IPC section earlier.On April 23, 2023, a bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud had referred to a five-judge bench to decide the validity of the sedition provision under IPC Section 124A after rejecting govt's plea to pause judicial scrutiny and await Parliament's view on the proposed new penal code in BNS.On May 11,2022, a bench headed by then CJI N V Ramana had suspended operation of the sedition provision to stop police from invoking it against anyone and also stayed both probe and trial in existing sedition cases to allow the Centre to examine pruning the rigour of Section 124A. ""We expect that, till the re-examination of the provision is complete, it will be appropriate not to continue the usage of the aforesaid provision of law (Section 124A) by govts,"" the CJI Ramana-led bench had said.In the Kedarnath Singh case in 1962, SC had read down the provisions of Section 124A . ""It is only when the words, written or spoken, etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest of public order.

In response to an RTI query, National Medical Commission (NMC) stated that of the 11,200 applications for registration received, 91% have not been approved as of Aug 8.Launched with much fanfare by Union health minister on Aug 23, 2024, the NMR portal of NMC for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible to practise in India has failed to take off. NMR was hailed as a move to ""strengthen the digital healthcare ecosystem"", after which similar registers were to be launched for paramedics and other healthcare professionals. Yet, with the register for doctors - who constitute the smallest professional group in the health system - not materialising, it remains to be seen whether the registers for an estimated 35 lakh nurses and for paramedics, who would be more than double the number of nurses, will happen any time soon.In response to a question in Parliament, the health ministry said that 13.9 lakh MBBS doctors are registered with state councils, of which it is assumed that about 80% (over 11 lakh) are available.NMC had issued the Registration of Medical Practitioners and Licence to Practice Medicine Regulations, 2023, on June 8, 2023. According to the regulation, NMC's Ethics & Medical Registration Board shall maintain the NMR, which shall contain entries of all doctors in all state registers maintained by state medical councils. The regulations envisage a unique identification number for every doctor, centrally generated by EMRB, which will ""grant registration in NMR and eligibility to practice medicine in India"".All existing medical practitioners enrolled in the Indian Medical Register or the State Medical Register not having registration number as per the regulation were mandated to update their registration in the web portal of EMRB within three months of publication of the regulation.However, applications have petered out as approvals for 90% of those who applied are still pending. From 6,000 applications in the first three months after launch, applications have dwindled to less than 800 in past four months.The renewal of registration every five years is supposed to happen through state councils and the status of registration in the state registry ""shall automatically reflected (sic) in the National Register"". However, state registries are yet to be linked to NMR.""Even when state councils confirm the membership of a doctor, NMC is rejecting it, as in my case,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist.

Global rights organisation Amnesty also questioned the move. The home department has described the action as part of an ongoing crackdown on publications allegedly promoting secessionist ideologies, glorifying terrorism, or disseminating distorted historical narratives.Chief minister Omar Abdullah responded to accusations that he had ordered the ban. “Get your facts right before you call me a coward, you ignoramus. The ban has been imposed by the LG using the only department he officially controls - the Home Department. I’ve never banned books & I never would,” Omar posted on X, responding to the allegations.Following Tuesday’s order under section 98 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023, police had on Thursday seized allegedly “subversive” books from stores and literary venues, including Chinar book festival on the banks of Dal Lake.NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq asked “why we are so afraid of differing opinions”. “History shows that banning books only fuels curiosity, people want to know why something is banned, and readership often increases as a result. Silencing or intimidating opinions never worked and it won’t work now,” Sadiq said.Amnesty India stressed that of the 25 banned books, including Roy’s Azadi, many were written by respected journalists, historians, feminists, and peace scholars, and these weren’t “terror manuals” but “critical voices”. “Censoring books on the basis of an executive notification without due process and judicial oversight doesn’t bring peace; it silences dissent.

No approvals needed for MSMEs up to Rs 125 Cr: Kejriwal

From ‘exploitative’ past to participatory governance

Industrial bodies asked to submit draft policies by October 2

NEW DELHI: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday launched 24 sectoral committees aimed at transforming Punjab’s industrial governance model. The committees will be responsible for drafting policies for each sector, shifting decision-making power from the bureaucracy to business owners, both large and small.“Policies will now be made by small and large business owners themselves; the government will implement them,” Kejriwal said at the launch event in Chandigarh. “True politics of AAP is handing power back to the people — it’s about participation, not control.”Each committee will include MSME representatives, larger businesses, and officials from the Punjab Bureau of Industrial Investment and District Industry Centres. According to CM Bhagwant Mann, the idea was proposed during government-industry consultations held in September 2023.Kejriwal highlighted new measures to ease regulatory hurdles for industries in the state. “Now, deemed approvals are being granted in 45 days in Punjab, and investments up to Rs 125 crore by MSMEs need no approval at all,” he said.He claimed that this model represented a break from previous regimes.“Earlier, the system in Punjab punished entrepreneurs for their growth — they were threatened and extorted,” he added.Describing the transition in phases, Kejriwal said, “Before 2022 – A corrupt, exploitative system inherited by AAP. 2022–2025 – The reform phase under an honest government. Now – A revolutionary model of governance led by industry.”“We don’t know how to run a textile unit or manufacture sports equipment. Nor do the officers. But still, politicians take all decisions, and people run around us,” he said. “That system is now gone.”Kejriwal urged industry stakeholders not to focus on subsidies. “Subsidies aren’t sustainable. If profit depends on them, the day subsidies stop, so does profit,” he said, calling for innovation and ease of doing business instead.The sectoral committees are expected to study national and international policies and submit their sector-specific drafts by October 2. “Make Punjab the most attractive state for investment in each sector. This is a new governance model — the government is stepping back to let people lead,” Kejriwal said.Mann echoed the sentiment, stating that the AAP government was committed to reversing Punjab’s economic decline. “Previous governments looted Punjab, but the AAP government will realize the dream of making Punjab vibrant again,” he said.Kejriwal, responding to criticism around delayed approvals, added: “Some say if you delay approvals, people will come back with bribes, and that’s how party funds are raised. But we don’t want that.

We then focused on seven unexpected losses. We focused on Mahadevapur... All data is 2024 data from the Election Commission; the total votes polled in the Lok Sabha were 6.26 lakhs. The BJP won with 658,915, securing a margin of 32,707. But then we look at Mahadevapura, where Congress polls 115,586 and BJP polls 229,632. Congress wins all Vidhan Sabhas but this one,"" the Congress leader said.""We found 100,250 votes stolen. Stolen in five different ways. Duplicate voters, fake and invalid addresses, and bulk voters in a single address, in a building with 50-60 people living. But when we go there, there is no record of those people living there.

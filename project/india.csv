'Talent vacuum in BJP': Congress on reports of Shashi Tharoor leading delegation of MPs to expose Pakistan's terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talent-vacuum-in-bjp-congress-on-reports-of-shashi-tharoor-leading-delegation-of-mps-to-expose-pakistans-terrorism/articleshow/121226984.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday welcomed the Centre’s decision to bring in Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation of MPs tasked with exposing Pakistan-sponsored terrorism on international platforms.Taking to X, the Kerala Congress claimed that the government chose Tharoor for the role due to a “talent vacuum” within the BJP, asserting that the nation needs a voice that commands global respect.“At a time when Prime Minister Modi and his external affairs minister have lost credibility internationally, the nation needs a voice that commands respect. We appreciate the government for recognising the talent vacuum within the BJP and choosing a Congress leader to represent the country,” the party said.“We are confident that Shashi Tharoor will present India's case at the global level and correct the mistakes made by the Modi government,” the post added.The statement comes a day after the government announced plans to send around 40 parliamentarians to various parts of the world to highlight Pakistan's continued support for terrorism.The MPs will brief the international community about Pakistan’s ongoing involvement in cross-border terrorism and draw attention to India’s recently launched Operation Sindoor.The 10-day tour is expected to commence on May 23, with delegations likely to visit key world capitals including Washington D.C., London, Abu Dhabi, Johannesburg, and Tokyo.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is leading the coordination efforts for the initiative. Several opposition MPs, including Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Priyanka Chaturvedi, and Sasmit Patra, have reportedly been approached to participate.This will be the first time the Centre is deputing a multi-party delegation of MPs to present India’s stance on Kashmir and cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan.Although the government has not made an official announcement, it is understood that the ministry of external affairs, ministry of home affairs, ministry of parliamentary affairs, and other agencies are preparing detailed dossiers to substantiate India’s allegations against Pakistan.An official from the ministry of external affairs is expected to accompany the delegations.The move comes in the wake of precision strikes by Indian armed forces on terrorist launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Following several days of confrontation along the Line of Control, both nations agreed to a ceasefire on May 10. India clarified that while military operations would cease, there would be no diplomatic engagement with Islamabad",The Kerala Congress claimed that the government chose Tharoor for the role due to a “talent vacuum” within the BJP.

Parenting and the Quiet Art of Letting Go,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parenting-and-the-quiet-art-of-letting-go/articleshow/121214817.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.





The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might





that His arrows may go swift and far.”

Kural 68

Thammin Tham Makkal Arivudaimai Maanilaththu

Mannuyir Kellaam Inidhu.

It is a matter of joy for the entire humanity to find oneself outdone in

Intelligence by one’s children.

I was part of that journey.

Kural

A casual visit to a friend’s home can sometimes offer more than hospitality. On a recent work trip, an evening spent with an old colleague and his family brought unexpected joy. Laughter echoed through their home, the dining table buzzed with conversation, and the energy of their two young daughters brought the household alive with their constant chorus of “Amma, where’s my clip?” or “Can we please order dessert? I’ve stopped coughing!” Their world revolved around each other and was filled with warmth and unfiltered affection.After I returned to my hotel, I felt a whisper of sorrow in my heart—not for what was missing, but for what had quietly faded. At one point in my life, my home too was filled with endless demands from my daughters. And then things slowly quietened. I can’t remember when I stopped plaiting their hair or when it changed from: “Can I please go?” to “I will be late today”.Many parents will identify with this feeling. The realization doesn’t come as a blow, but as a slow unveiling; one day they reach for your hand, and the next, they gently let go. Not out of rejection, but out of readiness.This shift is not failure. It is fulfilment. But it still aches.We often speak of parenting as a journey of nurturing, protecting, and teaching. Rarely do we prepare ourselves for its most spiritual act: stepping back. The early years are intense. And then, slowly, the distance grows. The bond remains, but its texture changes. Less visible, more inward.There is deep emotional fatigue in parenting—not just from the effort of raising children, but from accepting that the most beautiful chapters are often fleeting. The days of packing lunch boxes, helping with homework, and being the axis on which your child ’s world revolves, pass quietly.In such times, it helps to look for wisdom beyond our own. Kahlil Gibran writes:But long before Gibran,offered clarity on this inThis is not just a compliment to a child’s intelligence—it is a directive to the parent to release the old model of authority and pride, and cultivate humility and joy in witnessing growth that surpasses our own. It invites us to evolve from participants to spectators, from teachers to admirers. When a child becomes wiser, more capable, more independent—that is not an ending, but an apex.The mountain raises the river in its lap, lets it gather force, and watches it surge ahead, cutting valleys and nourishing lands it will never see. The mountain does not mourn. It stands tall, steady in its knowing:That is how humanity moves forward. What remains with us is not the noise of their childhood, but its echo. A soft, lingering hum that stays long after the room has fallen silent.Thereminds us that parenting is not possession—it is a privilege. One that asks us not just to shape lives, but to celebrate when those lives begin shaping themselves.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121214870,imgsize-60018,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/121214870.jpg"

Alarm ringing in Himalayas: Environment minister Bhupender Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/alarm-ringing-in-himalayas-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav/articleshow/121222005.cms,"Bhupender Yadav (File photo)

‘Need regional synergy to protect fragile ecosystems’

(With agency inputs)

DEHRADUN: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the Himalayas, which is marked by accelerated glacier melt, while addressing ‘ Sagarmatha Sambaad ’ — a global dialogue on climate change and its impact on mountainous regions — in Kathmandu on Friday.“The science is clear. The Himalayas are sounding the alarm,” Yadav said, warning that climate change is hastening glacier retreat and endangering water security for downstream populations.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav added that the Himalayan communities are under threat despite contributing little to the climate crisis, and called for regional cooperation to share knowledge and protect these fragile ecosystems.The Union minister’s call for action comes on the heels of a study published in ‘Journal of Glaciology’ by Cambridge University Press which revealed a troubling trend at Himachal Pradesh’s Gepang Gath glacier: rapid glacial retreat coupled with the dramatic expansion of its proglacial lake — a water body that forms at the front or side of a glacier and is typically dammed by moraine, glacial ice, or debris. Over the past six decades, this lake has grown nearly sixfold, from 0.2 sq km in 1962 to 1.2 sq km in 2023.Led by scientists from National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under ministry of earth sciences, the study links this expansion directly to the glacier’s retreat, further accelerated by calving (the breaking off of ice chunks from the glacier’s terminus). Between 2014 and 2023, Gepang Gath retreated 480m, resulting in substantial surface area loss and volume loss (21.7 million cubic metres of ice). The glacier’s mass balance has shown a consistently negative trend, indicating it is losing more mass than it gains.The study highlights a dangerous feedback loop: as the lake grows, its relatively warm water accelerates melting at the glacier’s edge, triggering further calving.To prevent disasters, the study calls for urgent measures, including the establishment of early warning systems for the proglacial lake and enhanced monitoring of glacier-lake dynamics.",Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the Himalayas.

Justice Trivedi's career recap

Boycott of judge’s farewell not in good taste, says CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai on Friday disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi , the tenth woman judge in the 75-year history of the court.The boycott stemmed from a split decision of an SC bench on punishment to an AoR who had reportedly suppressed material and attempted to mislead the court in a criminal case. While Justice Trivedi had ordered the AoR’s name to be struck off the rolls for a month, her colleague Satish C Sharma had let him off with a warning.During the farewell in the CJI’s courtroom, many advocates, especially women, complimented Justice Bela M Trivedi for a sterling career that exemplified integrity, hard work and protection of institutional dignity.She had joined Ahmedabad City civil court as an additional district and sessions judge in 1995, when her father, too, was a judge in that court. She became an high court judge in 2011 and was appointed as a judge of Supreme Court in Aug 2021.CJI B R Gavai said though Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Kapil Sibal was present, the boycott of farewell of a judge by the two associations was not in good taste. “We deprecate such a stand of SCBA and SC Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA).” CJI’s bench partner Justice A G Masih said, “Good traditions must be followed and respected.”Justice Trivedi, who will retire on June 9, would not be available on the last working day of SC on May 23 prior to the summer break as she has a family wedding in the US. She said it is for the first time that the CJI has broken tradition to invite all her relatives for tea after the ceremonial bench, and dinner.Attorney general R Venkataramani said Justice Trivedi delivered justice while scrupulously adhering to the law. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Justice Trivedi has never attempted to mould relief to suit popular sentiments, which is a rare thing. This needs courage of conviction, courage to displease people. I lost most of the matters before her, as HC or SC judge, but our respect can never depend on the relief we got or refused.”SG Mehta said, “There are certain individuals who feel that ‘my word should be the last word in law’ and that never happened in Justice Trivedi’s court, where the last word was the word of law even if it was at the expense of displeasing some people... Our respect and love for the judge is not contingent upon whether relief is being granted or not.”",CJI B R Gavai disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi.

Operation Sindoor: Over 600 Pakistan drones killed by Army air defence units,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-over-600-pakistan-drones-killed-by-army-air-defence-units/articleshow/121221694.cms,"Indian Army's air defence units swiftly deployed along the western front, successfully neutralizing over 600 Pakistani drones and repelling the rest during 'Operation Sindoor'. A multi-layered air defence network, integrating legacy weapons with indigenous systems like Akash and Akashteer, showcased unmatched precision and thwarted Pakistan's attempts to overwhelm India's air defence grid. This operation demonstrated India's enhanced AD preparedness.

NEW DELHI: Over 600 drones launched by Pakistan were simply swatted out of the sky while the rest were repelled by Army air defence (AD) units, which were swiftly deployed along the western front in the build-up to the launch of ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on May 7, senior officers said on Friday.More than 1,000 AD gun systems and 750 short and medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, of all shapes and sizes, plugged into a wide array of radars, were mobilised in double-quick time. This ensured the multi-layered air defence network transformed from a peacetime posture to full operational readiness to thwart the multiple waves of drones unleashed by Pakistan during the four days of hostilities last week.“The operation not only safeguarded vital military and civilian infrastructure but also shattered the myth of drone supremacy. It has shown that Indian boots on the ground, backed by indigenous technology and rigorous training, can defend the skies with unmatched precision,” a senior Army Air Defence (AAD) officer said.Pakistan’s strategy of launching multiple drone swarms , many of them armed, were aimed to map and test India’s AD radar network as well as get the Indian armed forces to deplete their stockpiles of ammunition and missiles designed to take on hostile aerial threats. The Indian defence establishment was ready, having built adequate ammo reserves through regular and emergency procurements over the last five years due to the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“Pakistan’s strategy was to overwhelm India’s integrated air defence grid, gather real-time intelligence, and target population centres, military assets and places of worship. But it failed spectacularly,” another officer said.“We neither open up all our radars, nor keep them open round-the-clock, to ensure the adversary does not pick up electronic signatures. One also does not use the top-end Russian S-400 (interception range 380km) or Barak-8 MR-SAM (70km, jointly produced with Israel) AD systems against low-value targets like small drones,” he added.Old ‘legacy’ AD weapons like L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and upgraded Schilka, often underestimated in this era of high-tech warfare, proved their mettle in this arena. “They emerged as highly effective point defence systems against low-flying, hard-to-detect drone swarms,” he said.The indigenous Akash AD missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, also played a major role in taking care of the bigger threats like aircraft, armed UAVs and the Turkish Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones.Army deployed six nodes of its new indigenous Akashteer air defence control and reporting systems, which were fully plugged into IAF’s larger IACCS ( integrated air command and control system ) for a real-time composite air situation picture available to all commanders on the ground, as reported by TOI earlier.“Akashteer’s digital backbone offered unmatched situational awareness and real-time command-and-control capabilities, enabling commanders to neutralise threats swiftly without risking friendly aerial platforms,” the officer said. The “sheer scale” of engagement, speed of deployment, and level of integration between sensors, shooters & networks across the Services is “a turning point” in India’s AD preparedness, he added.","More than 1,000 AD gun systems and 750 surface-to-air missile systems mobilised in double-quick time.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today.

India gives special entry to 160 Afghan trucks via Attari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-special-entry-to-160-afghan-trucks-via-attari/articleshow/121221556.cms,"Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at Attari

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan, as bilateral ties with the Taliban develop rapidly even in the absence of a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul. According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that took place a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but not any reverse export from India to Afghanistan.Expanding trade ties was one of the issues that external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed with the Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in what was the first political engagement between India and the Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $ 1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan to not hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar on Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistan authorities to sow discord between India and the Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed India’s Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan and, while also considering more development cooperation projects for the people of Afghanistan. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are also considering humanitarian assistance for the Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,’’ said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait until the international community remains convinced that the Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have also provided 2000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,’’ added the source.",India is learnt to have approved entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader P Chidambaram says the future of INDIA bloc is not so bright. BJP has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress.

It could harm relations with Pakistan. It is a strategic move for India.

Indus Waters Treaty

What India is planning



Impact on Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the Indus river system, a move that could drastically reduce the water supply to Pakistan. This development comes amid heightened tensions following a deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22 by Pakistan-backed terrorists.Shorlty after the attack, India had suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark water-sharing agreement between the two countries that has historically regulated the use of the Indus river and its tributaries.Despite the ceasefire agreement reached after intense fighting in early May, the Indus Waters Treaty remains suspended, and India's water projects are moving forward, according to a report by Reuters.Experts note that while large-scale infrastructure projects take years to complete, the political message and initial impacts on water flow are already significant. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for water to become a new flashpoint in the already tense India-Pakistan relationship.The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank in 1960, allocates the waters of six rivers between India and Pakistan. India controls the eastern rivers — Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi — while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers —Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum. Under the treaty, India is allowed limited use of the western rivers for irrigation and hydropower projects but must not significantly affect the water flow to Pakistan.Following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 civilians were killed, India suspended its adherence to the treaty, citing Pakistan's involvement in cross-border terrorism.External affairs minister S. Jaishankar has made it clear that the treaty will remain ""in abeyance"" until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably stops cross-border terrorism. He also emphasised that India is willing to engage with Pakistan only on issues related to terrorism and the return of illegally occupied territories in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), rejecting broader talks on Kashmir or the treaty itself for the time being.In a strategic move, India is accelerating plans to increase its water extraction from the Indus river system, particularly focusing on the Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers, which are primarily allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.One of the most impactful projects under consideration is the expansion of the Ranbir Canal on the Chenab river.Originally built in the 19th century and currently about 60 kilometers long, the plan is to extend this canal to 120 kilometers.This expansion would increase India’s capacity to divert water from 40 cubic meters per second to 150 cubic meters per second, significantly reducing the flow of water into Pakistan’s Punjab province, a key agricultural region.Additionally, India is exploring other irrigation and hydropower projects that could further reduce water availability downstream. Government documents reviewed by Reuters indicate proposals to potentially redirect water from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers into rivers within northern Indian states, further limiting water flow into Pakistan.These projects include the construction of dams capable of storing large quantities of water-something India has not previously done on the western rivers under the treaty’s restrictions.Read More: Operation Sindoor: How India delivered devastating blow to Pakistan’s air defence with dummy jets, BrahMos missiles Pakistan relies on the Indus river system for approximately 80% of its agriculture and much of its hydropower generation. Any substantial reduction in water flow could have severe consequences for Pakistan’s food security, economy, and energy supply.Islamabad has already reported a 90% drop in water levels at a critical receiving point following Indian maintenance work on Indus projects, providing a glimpse of the pressure it might face if India proceeds with its plans.Pakistan has condemned India’s suspension of the treaty and warned that attempts to halt or divert water flows would be considered an ""act of war.""The Indus Waters Treaty has long been regarded as one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally, having survived multiple wars and ongoing tensions.",India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the Indus river system.

NEW DELHI: Turkish-origin firm Celebi Airport Services India , which handled ground handling operations at various airports in India, including in the capital, approached the Delhi high court on Friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog BCAS to revoke its security clearance in the “interest of national security”.The plea questions the move to act against the firm on “vague” national security concerns , a decision taken by govt days after Türkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. It is likely to be taken up for hearing next week. Celebi, operating in the Indian aviation sector for over 15 years and employing over 10,000 people, offers its services at nine airports.According to sources, it argued that the Indian govt’s decision to revoke its security clearance, which provides airport ground handling services across India, will jeopardise thousands of jobs and threaten investor confidence.Celebi maintains that its operations in India are independent and professionally governed, distancing itself from any political affiliations. It is likely to seek an urgent stay, arguing that mere rhetoric of national security can’t be a ground to take such action as govt’s move fails to reveal grounds or reasons why such an action is called for and gives no justification.Following the revocation of Celebi NAS Airport Services’ security clearance, Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu assured that efforts are underway to retain employees. A press release from the civil aviation ministry stated that BCAS revoked Celebi's security clearance on grounds related to national security. Govt reaffirmed its commitment to national security, passenger convenience, and uninterrupted cargo operations while managing the fallout from the decision.The firm handles around 58,000 flights and 540,000 tonnes of cargo annually in India, according to its website. It is present at Mumbai, Delhi, Cochin, Kannur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Goa, Ahmedabad, and Chennai airports.In a statement issued earlier, Celebi Aviation India said it remains in full compliance with Indian aviation, national security, and tax regulations, and operates with complete transparency.It rejected all allegations regarding the company's ownership and operations in India and reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to the country's aviation sector.",Celebi Airport Services India approached the Delhi high court on Friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog BCAS to revoke its security clearance.

Sack Devda & Vijay Shah, demands Congress

BHOPAL: Even as BJP is battling the crisis triggered by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, a fresh controversy erupted Friday over a statement by deputy CM Jagdish Devda.Thanking PM Narendra Modi while lauding the military’s courage in Op Sindoor, Devda said at a training programme for civil defence volunteers in Jabalpur Friday: “Yashaswi Pradhan Mantriji ko hum dhanyawad dena chahenge. Aur poora desh, desh ki woh sena, woh sainik, unke charno mein natmastak hain. Unke charno mein poora desh natmastak hain. Unhone jo jawab diya hai, uski jitni sarahna ki jaye, jitni kaha jaye utna kam hai.” The dispute is over Devda using the words ‘unke charno mein’. While Congress claimed Devda meant the ‘PM’s feet’, BJP said he meant the Army’s feet.BJP, which is on a defensive after Shah’s remark, stoutly defended Devda, with IT cell chief Amit Malviya alleging that Congress is targeting the deputy CM because he is a Dalit. “Congress is unable to accept that a Dalit leader holds such a prominent position,” he said.“Deliberately distorting Devda ji’s statement is an attempt to create sensation and an atmosphere of lies,” Malviya tweeted. Devda warned of legal action, saying: “My speech is being presented in a wrong and distorted manner, which is absolutely improper. I said that the courage shown by the Army in conducting Operation Sindoor against terrorists cannot be praised enough. The entire country and the people of the country bow at their feet and salute them. I too salute them.” Devda defended himself by saying: “What I meant was people of the country salute brave soldiers of the Army. My statement is being circulated in the wrong manner. I have not given any such statement for which an apology is required nor have I hurt anyone’s feelings.”Slamming MP deputy CM Jagdish Devda for allegedly saying that defence forces and its soldiers are at PM Modi’s feet and state minister Vijay Shah for his comments about Colonel Qureshi, Congress Friday said the BJP netas should be sacked from state govt without delay, else their utterances would be seen as having the approval of Modi and the BJP brass.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said comments from BJP politicians are tantamount to sedition but BJP is going all out to protect them, and the MP CM has already ruled out action against Shah. She asked how could Devda say “defence forces are at the PM’s feet” when they are responsible for maintaining peace, and when the country is full of respect for the way they stunned Pakistan in the recent face-off.“These words are like committing a sin and BJP is doing it time and again,” Shrinate told reporters. “An apology or regret will not work this time. Devda has to be sacked. BJP cannot be a bystander this time.”","Madhya Pradesh deputy CM Jagdish Devda allegedly said that defence forces and its soldiers are at PM Modi’s feet.

NEW DELHI: Congress veteran P Chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition INDIA bloc was no longer intact while stressing that an alliance was required to take on the ‘formidable’ BJP machinery that “controls from Election Commission to the lowest police station” — echoing concerns among many players in the anti-BJP grouping amid growing dissonance and lack of active coordination.“If INDIA bloc is totally intact, I am very, very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed. It can be put together, there is still time,” Chidambaram said at a function to release a book on 2024 elections , ‘Contesting Democratic Deficit’, by Congress’ Salman Khurshid and Mrityunjay Yadav.A gleeful BJP latched on to the comments to state that successive defeats had left Congress scarred. “Chidambaram used the word ‘formidable’ six times to describe BJP and its election machinery in a speech that lasted less than three minutes. Successive defeats have left Congress scarred, much like Pakistan after its bases were destroyed by the IAF,” BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya posted on X.Chidambaram’s remarks struck a chord with many politicians who have raised alarm that INDIA bloc has stopped having meetings and players like NCP of Sharad Pawar are seen to be toying with options outside. But the widespread lament in the bloc may not yield much result as electoral compulsions of partners are, in any case, likely to keep them away for many months. Four key allies — TMC, Congress, AAP and the Left parties — will be taking on each other in West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab in 2025 and 2026, and party leaders are loath to be seen together.That is the reason, sources said, the alliance partners have joined hands for coordination in Parliament but have not held meetings outside in recent months. In the most recent instance, Pawar has expressed disagreement with Congress’s demand for a special session of Parliament to discuss Operation Sindoor. TMC has not supported it either. However, Congress argues that alliances in key states are intact, citing examples of Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala, UP, J&K, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which retains the INDIA flavour to a large extent.But Chidambaram’s alarm appeared to emphasise that the parties could not just cobble an alliance during LS polls and needed to strengthen it during the interim period. “In my reading of history, there has been no political party that has been so formidably organised as BJP. In every department, it is formidable. It’s not another political party. It’s a machine behind which is another machine. And, the two machines control all of the machinery of India — from ECI to the lowest police station in India. They are able to control and sometimes capture these institutions,” he said. “We are still an electoral democracy. We are not a full-fledged democracy no more, we are an electoral democracy ,” he added.",Congress veteran P Chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition INDIA bloc was no longer intact.

The move directly impacts Celebi's ground handling operations , considered sensitive from a security standpoint, at nine major Indian airports: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Goa, Cochin, and Kannur.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd (CASIPL), along with two other group companies, manages ground handling operations at these locations.“The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has revoked Celebi’s security clearance on grounds related to national security. Nothing is above the security of our nation and our fellow citizens. National interest and public safety are paramount and non-negotiable,” Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a statement. He added that efforts are underway to retain employees of Celebi and ensure continued handling of passenger and cargo services at the affected airports.The order, which takes immediate effect, is widely seen as a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration that countries perceived to support Pakistan will face economic consequences. During Operation Sindoor, Pakistan reportedly used Turkish-origin drones in attacks on Indian cities, triggering diplomatic fallout.Amid growing public backlash, Turkish businesses are also feeling the heat in India. Tour operators have reported widespread cancellations of travel to Turkey, while protests have emerged against Turkish products such as marbles and apples.Celebi, meanwhile, has denied any links to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s daughter, Sümeyye Erdoğan, who was reported to have a stake in the company. Sümeyye is married to Selçuk Bayraktar, the chairman of BAYKAR, the manufacturer of the drones allegedly used by Pakistan.Concerns about potential disruption at Indian airports were eased after Delhi airport authorities announced the termination of their contract with CASIPL and assured continued smooth operations and employee retention. Most major airports in India work with multiple ground handling service providers. In Delhi, Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) are active. Bengaluru is served by AISATS and GlobeGround India, while Kochi has BFS, AI Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), and Agile (run by IndiGo).Ground handling companies are responsible for a range of critical airport services, including baggage and cargo loading, passenger check-in and boarding, fueling, maintenance support, cleaning, and guiding aircraft safely on the tarmac.","Turkey-based aviation firm Celebi on Friday filed a case against the government’s move to revoke its security clearance.

NEW DELHI: In a display of modern warfare, India unveiled its indigenous air defence network with Akashteer , a fully automated Air Defence Control and Reporting System.The newly operational automated air defence system, Akashteer, played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by Pakistan on the night of May 9th and 10th, according to a press release from the Ministry of Defence.The ministry said the attack targeted both military and civilian areas and was repelled without any of the projectiles hitting their intended targets. “By the time the enemy knew they were being watched, they were already being targeted,” the statement claimed.Akashteer focuses on strategic warfare rather than raw power, according to the government. The integrated platform delivers instantaneous aerial surveillance data to all connected entities (control room, radars and Defence Gun), facilitating synchronised air defence activities. The system automates the process of detecting, monitoring and countering hostile aircraft, drones and missiles. It combines different radar mechanisms, sensors and communication systems into one unified operational structure.The government further revealed that, Akashteer automates surveillance and response, and provides a real-time common air picture to various defence units. It is vehicle-mounted, enhancing mobility and allowing deployment in active combat zones. ""Akashteer has demonstrated that it sees, decides, and strikes faster than anything the world has fielded,"" said the government, boasting the capabilities of the defence system.The government said Akashteer was developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to reduce reliance on imports and increase indigenous capability. “What stood between them and their intended targets was not just technology, but years of commitment to Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the release said.Pakistan, which reportedly used Chinese-supplied HQ-9 and HQ-16 systems, failed to intercept Indian counter-strikes during the exchange. Officials said the performance gap highlighted the strategic value of domestic defence systems tailored to Indian requirements.Akashteer is part of a broader network that includes integration with the Indian Air Force’s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) and the Indian Navy’s TRIGUN platform. This tri-services coordination is designed to reduce friendly fire incidents and improve response times.The system also forms a component of India's wider C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) framework, a critical part of modern military operations.Akashteer joins a growing list of indigenous platforms under development, including the Dhanush artillery system, ATAGS, MBT Arjun, LCA Tejas, ALH, and several naval platforms. According to the Ministry of Defence, 65 per cent of defence equipment is now produced domestically, compared to 30 to 35 per cent a decade ago.India is targeting Rs 3 lakh crore in total defence production by 2029. The private sector now contributes 21 per cent of output, supported by 16 Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), over 430 licensed companies, and about 16,000 MSMEs.While Akashteer’s performance during Operation Sindoor is still being assessed in detail, officials say its use marks a transition in India’s approach from reactive defence to more proactive and integrated airspace control.","Akashteer played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”, Union Jal Shakti ministry has conveyed to the cabinet secretary in its monthly report.Though the ministry has articulated the country’s well stated position on the issue after keeping the treaty in abeyance, the communication assumes significance in the wake of the latest missive from Pakistan appealing to India to reconsider the 1960 treaty, citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by it.In a report to cabinet secretary T V Somanathan on Tuesday, Debashree Mukherjee, secretary of Jal Shakti ministry, said the govt announced that the treaty would be held in “abeyance” with immediate effect in the aftermath of the “Pakistan-sponsored” terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam.“The key water-sharing treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism ,” she said in her report.","The Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism’ Pakistan has appealed to India to reconsider the 1960 treaty, citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121221614,imgsize-104540,width-400,resizemode-4/Pak-signals-willingness-to-engage-on-Indus-Waters-Treaty-with-India.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Pulling the curtain down on a 25-year-old legal battle between the two factions of Iskcon over control of Hare Krishna temple and other assets in Bengaluru, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that Iskcon Bangalore will have control over it and quashed the Karnataka high court order in favour of Iskcon Mumbai .Noting that Iskcon was established with a laudable object and had initiated the Hare Krishna movement, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said the dispute between Iskcon Mumbai and Iskcon Bangalore ought not to have been brought to court. The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality , began in 2001 when Iskcon Bangalore filed a civil suit for control of the temple and other material assets.Examining all the documentary records and statement of witnesses, the court said that the application for allotment of land was made by Iskcon Bangalore and the sale deed was also executed in its favour, and Iskcon Mumbai cannot lay claim over it.“Therefore, the high court’s finding that Iskcon Mumbai, through its branch in Bangalore, was the owner of the Schedule ‘A’ property is completely erroneous and deserves to be set aside. It is completely contrary to the documentary evidence. Even assuming that Iskcon Bangalore did not possess funds, and even if money came from Iskcon Mumbai, it cannot claim ownership. Only because the existence of the Bangalore branch of Iskcon Mumbai was proved, one cannot jump to the conclusion that allotment of Schedule ‘A’ property was to Iskcon Mumbai through the Bangalore branch,” the court said.Karnataka HC had on May 23, 2011 passed an order in favour of the Mumbai unit by setting aside the decree passed by the trial court, and Iskcon Bangalore thereafter moved the apex court which passed an interim order to maintain status quo.","The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality, began in 2001.

NEW DELHI: BJP launched a digital offensive against Pakistan on Friday, mocking its failed military retaliation after Operation Sindoor and exposing Islamabad’s use of fake news to project false victories.In a symbolic jab, BJP shared a 31-second clip from the tied India-Pakistan match during the 2007 T20 World Cup, where India clinched a 3-0 bowl-out win. Indian bowlers Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa hit the stumps with precision while Pakistan’s Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi failed completely. “Kuch aisa tha.

No chaos at major airports as other ground handlers step in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-chaos-at-major-airports-as-other-ground-handlers-step-in/articleshow/121220710.cms,"A recent government rule impacted operations of Turkiye's Celebi at nine Indian airports. Existing ground handling agencies stepped in to manage the workload. GMR Group made alternate arrangements at Goa's Mopa airport. Over 10,000 Celebi employees were absorbed by other handlers like Bird Group and AISATS. Operations have stabilized with no major disruptions.

NEW DELHI: The govt rule mandating that airports handling over a crore passengers annually have at least three ground handling agencies (GHA) meant that flights and passengers at majority of the nine airports from where Turkiye’s Celebi was barred on Thursday were not affected.Other ground handlers equally handled their share of the job Celebi was doing. This is an interim arrangement and airport operators will now issue tenders inviting bids for a third GHA.The exceptions included Goa (Mopa), where the Turkish company was the only JV and where the GMR Group has made alternate arrangements for now. The other eight airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Cochin — asked the other GHAs to chip in.Among the leading GHAs in India are Air India Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS), Bird Group’s Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Agile Airport Services (of IndiGo). “Air India and IndiGo mostly do their own self-handling through these companies. Other GHAs cater to smaller domestic and international airlines. In Delhi, for instance, non-airline GHAs may be handling 1-1.5 crore passengers annually. This keeps reducing for other airports. When the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) order of Thursday revoked security clearance to Celebi and its associated companies, airport operators reached out to us and asked us to do Celebi’s job for some time,” said a leading non-airline GHA.The handover from Celebe was completed within 24 hours, say people in the know. “The over 10,000 employees of Çelebi have been absorbed across interim handlers. About 35-40% of them have joined Bird Group, while the rest have been placed with AISATS and AIASL. There have been no job losses,” said another ground handler.Barring a few hiccups — mostly administrative and linked to communicating now with people who overnight came onto their rolls — GHAs say “operations have stabilised and there are no reported flight delays or passenger disruption”.“Till a third GHA is appointed, existing handlers will operate in a non profit, support-only capacity to ensure service continuity and regulatory compliance. We are stretched but in national interest will do the job as long as it is required to be done...,” they said.","Turkiye's Celebi was barred on Thursday from nine Indian airports.

These included student and faculty exchanges, joint research, and dual degree programmes.LPU chancellor and Rajya Sabha MP, Ashok Kumar Mittal said: “National security is not safeguarded solely at the borders — it must be defended in every classroom, boardroom, and international collaboration.”On Thursday, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) urged over 1,100 universities to review and, if needed, suspend or end partnerships with institutions in Pakistan, Turkiye, and Bangladesh. The appeal follows a terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.AIU president, Vinay Kumar Pathak accused these countries of supporting anti-India narratives and called for academic institutions to show national solidarity in their international engagements.","IIT-Roorkee has cancelled its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Inonu University, Turkiye.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the “firm political will of PM Narendra Modi, pinpointed information generated by our intelligence agencies and the infallible strike capability of the three armed forces”.“India is proud of its three armed forces, BSF and all the security agencies ,” Shah said while unveiling the upgraded Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the country’s foremost intelligence fusion centre — that connects all the intelligence, security, law enforcement and investigative agencies, at the North Block here.He underlined the new MAC will provide a seamless and integrated platform for agencies to coordinate their efforts towards addressing complex and interconnected national security challenges like terrorism, extremism, organised crime and cyber attacks.Referring to the 21-day anti-Naxal operation conducted recently by security forces at the Karreguttalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, Shah said this displayed exemplary coordination between intelligence agencies and security forces. “There is very good coordination in the process and thinking of our intelligence agencies and the three armed forces,” he noted.The home minister lauded the new MAC network, which has undergone a hardware and software upgrade in record time to acquire futuristic capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This will help to harness the potential of the vast database with MAC and geographic information system (GIS) services.Unveiling the future roadmap for the security establishment, Shah emphasised upon the need to integrate other significant databases housed with different central agencies in different silos, onto one platform, for leveraging advanced data analytics. The system, Shah said, will elevate the quality of data analytics generated on the MAC network, enabling accurate trend analysis, hotspot mapping and timeline analysis to give predictive and operational outcomes. “The new MAC will go a long way in combating the terror ecosystem having intricate linkages with organised crime,” he said.Shah has been actively guiding the technological upgradation of MAC, which was set up in 2001. Housed with the Intelligence Bureau, the new MAC follows qualitative and quantitative transformation at a cost of over Rs 500 crore.It has weaved in the country’s island territories, insurgency-affected areas and high-altitude terrain, while ensuring last-mile connectivity down to the district level, with a fast and standalone secure network.","Home minister Amit Shah said ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the ‘firm political will of PM Narendra Modi’ The home minister lauded the new MAC network, which has undergone a hardware and software upgrade in record time to acquire futuristic capabilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121220597,imgsize-17362,width-400,resizemode-4/Op-Sindoor-result-of-firm-political-will-of-PM-Shah.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Stepping up its diplomatic offensive on Operation Sindoor , govt has decided to send five all-party delegations of MPs to different parts of the world starting next week to highlight Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Each team will have eight members.MPs belonging to BJP, Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP (SP), JDU, BJD, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPM and some other parties will be part of the delegations which are meant to signal national unity.Sources said some former ministers would lead the delegations scheduled to visit various countries over a period period of 10 days. MEA will brief the MPs before they depart.Though all parties appeared to be on board, Congress sources were angry that govt had reached out to its MPs and others directly instead of approaching the leadership first. Sources said while party members would join the delegations in “supreme national interest”, it was for the leadership to decide who from its ranks would go. They particularly appeared to be unhappy about the likelihood of Shashi Tharoor being the choice to head one of the delegations, possibly the one to the US. “He, being chairman of the standing committee on external affairs, should have been the logical choice, but his remarks have lately been out of line with the party’s stand,” said a source.Congress sources also indicated that they would push for the inclusion of deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi in one of the teams.Govt expressed surprise at Congress’s response. “Members of delegations are supposed to pursue national interest and not work as representatives of political parties. They are going there as Indians,” a source said. “The practice has always been that govt chooses the members. So far nobody has objected,” he added.A leader of a party that has been sounded out for the exercise said they were asked to be ready to leave by May 22-23 for a period of 10 days and that MEA would be in touch with them to provide details, including the itinerary.Former Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Anurag Thakur, Aparajita Sarangi, Samik Bhattacharya and Brij Lal are among the BJP members to be part of the teams, sources said.At least four MPs from Congress, besides members of other parties, have been tapped by govt for the exercise. They include Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh. However, Congress sources said at least three leaders told govt that it should contact their party leadership for the names.TMC’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay, JDU’s Sanjay Jha, BJD’s Sasmit Patra, CPM’s John Brittas, UBT’s Priyanka Chaturvedi, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule, DMK’s K Kanimozhi, AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi and AAP’s Vikramjit Sawhney are also being tapped to be part of the delegations, sources said.While Khurshid, a former external affairs minister, has been asked to lead a delegation of seven MPs to south and south-east Asia, covering countries such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore, Baramati MP Sule is likely to lead a team to West Asia and Africa, including the likes of Oman, Egypt, Kenya and South Africa, sources said.Tewari is likely to lead a delegation to Europe or West Asia and has been asked about his availability while Tharoor could lead a team to the US, they said, adding that former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was likely to be part of one delegation.While there was no official word from govt on the delegations, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said Union minister Kiren Rijiju had spoken to party president Mallikarjun Kharge.",Five all-party delegations of MPs will be sent to different parts of the world starting next week.

Film producer Akash Baskaran’s house in Teynampet was also searched but ED did not reveal the link between him and the ongoing investigation. ED teams, comprising at least four officers, reached the targeted premises in separate vehicles guarded by CRPF personnel.ED sources said the agency had issued summonses to Visakan twice, but they were not complied with. After an eight-hour search at his residence, ED sleuths took Visakan and his wife to their Nungambakkam office while the search continued at the residence. Visakan was brought back home around 9pm and was being interrogated at his house in Manapakkam.In March, after searching the Tasmac head office, distilleries and breweries, ED said it suspected a Rs 1,000 crore scam via illegal cash generation by inflated prices for bottles from manufacturers. It registered a case under PMLA based on DVAC FIRs registered between 2016 and 2021. Visakan was detained at the Tasmac office for at least two days.Though Tasmac approached Madras HC to declare ED searches illegal, court rejected the plea."," ED conducted searches at Visakan's residence and other locations, including the house of film producer Akash Baskaran. The investigation stems from a suspected ₹1,000 crore scam involving inflated bottle prices, based on DVAC FIRs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121220220,imgsize-48686,width-400,resizemode-4/121220220.jpg"
"Experts align with Omar’s view, saying revival of Tulbul Navigation Project will yield socio-economic benefits for J&K",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-align-with-omars-view-saying-revival-of-tulbul-navigation-project-will-yield-socio-economic-benefits-for-jk/articleshow/121219418.cms,"JK CM Omar Abdullah (File photo)

NEW DELHI: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti may have slammed Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah over his call for reviving the Tulbul Navigation Project , but he has echoed India’s long-term interests, with experts flagging how its implementation will yield socio-economic benefits for the entire UT.The project, also known as the Wular Barrage , is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, Wular, in J&K. It was designed to facilitate navigation on the Jhelum river during lean winter months (Oct-Feb) but was stalled by Pakistan citing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).As the treaty is in abeyance following the last month Pahalgam terror attack, experts, who have tracked the project’s development ever since it was stalled by Pakistan in 1987, believe that its implementation can be the most immediate step for the benefit of J&K.“It is time for India to finally break ground on the long-stalled Tulbul Navigation Project,” said Uttam Sinha, a senior fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses. He rues that for nearly four decades, the “developmental aspirations” of the people of Kashmir were “sacrificed at the altar of diplomatic caution” even as its implementation falls well within the treaty.“It is a matter of interpretation. India has long held the view that regulating depletion of naturally stored water for use of navigation, which is non-consumptive, is permissible under the IWT,” said Sinha.Kushvinder Vohra, former Central Water Commission chairperson, echoed similar views and explained how the project will help in better flood and water management through the Wular lake, and also help in tackling drainage congestion downstream.“It shall help in maintaining requisite water depth in the Jhelum below the Wular lake during the lean period so that navigation can be maintained throughout the year,” said Vohra, noting that it will also have an “incidental benefit” of increase in power production through hydro-electric projects .But why was the project stalled when it falls well within the treaty? After all, non-consumptive use is permitted to India under the IWT which includes control or use of water for navigation, provided these do not prejudice downstream uses of waters by Pakistan. Islamabad could never establish any prejudice to their downstream uses by the construction of the structure.Pakistan during multiple secretary-level talks in the past flagged that the project structure is a barrage with a storage capacity of around 0.3 million acre feet (0.369 billion cubic metre) and that India is not permitted to construct any storage facility on the main stem of the Jhelum river.Sinha said, “It’s a matter of interpretation...Now, the suspension (of the IWT) paves the way for a more assertive water strategy...Implementation of the Tulbul project is the most immediate step that can be taken.”","The project, also known as the Wular Barrage, is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, Wular.

SRINAGAR: The governing National Conference reiterated on Friday its demand for restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, the first time it has done so after the Pahalgam terror attack In response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s congratulatory message to “Sikkim on their Statehood Day”, NC chief spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq wrote on X, “Warm greetings to the people of Sikkim on their Statehood Day. As we celebrate the strength of India’s unity in diversity, we humbly urge Hon’ble PM@narendramodi ji to also grant Jammu & Kashmir its rightful place by restoring its statehood.

We killed Dalla ‘aide’ Harjit Singh Dhadda in Ontario: Lawrence Bishnoi gang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-killed-dalla-aide-in-ontario-lawrence-gang/articleshow/121197188.cms,"Lawrence Bishnoi

Despite warning, Dhadda helped Dalla get bail

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed the killing of a Sikh businessman in Ontario’s Mississauga early Thursday. The victim, Harjit Singh Dhadda , was shot multiple times near his office. Bishnoi’s aide, Rohit Godara , owned up to the killing, accusing Dhadda of furnishing a bail bond for Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla.“I, Rohit Godara, along with Goldy Brother, am taking responsibility. This man was close to our enemies. He got his brother Mehal Singh Uttarakhand murdered by giving money to Arsh Dalla and Sukha Dunuke. All were named in that case,” Godara said in a post.Godara’s post said Dhadda was given a warning a year ago but despite that he helped Arsh Dalla’s release on bail two months ago. “This will be the fate of whoever supports our enemy,” it added.Dhadda, a businessman in the trucking services industry, was shot dead near the intersection of Telford Way and Derry Road in Mississauga, Canada, the local police said. Dhadda was standing near his car when unidentified assailants, believed to have been lying in wait, approached and fired around 20 rounds before fleeing the scene. The gunfire caused panic in the parking lot.A staffer of a local office narrowly avoided injury when a stray bullet entered their office and hit an empty chair, just moments after they stood up. An eyewitness described the scene, saying the gunmen exited a parked car, fired many shots at close range. Dhadda was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.Dalla, who replaced slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, fled to Canada in July 2020. He was linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion, and targeted killings, with more than 13 FIRs registered against him. In January 2023, he was designated a terrorist by the Union home ministry for his involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding, and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.Godara, on the other hand, is on Interpol’s list of wanted men. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Godara in December last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies. “On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one ‘Pawan Kumar’. He is learnt to have taken the same route as his associate, Sachin Bishnoi, who also went to Azerbaijan and was staying in Baku,” said an official.","Harjit Singh Dhadda was shot multiple times near his office.

IAEA Confirms No Nuclear Radiation Leak from Kirana Hills Nuclear Facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/iaea-denies-radiation-leak-in-pak-after-op-sindoor-airstrikes/articleshow/121168129.cms,"Representative Image (AI)





DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan's Sargodha district during Operation Sindoor, triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA's press department in an email response to TOI's query stated, ""We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.""The development came two days after Indian Air Force's director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, ""Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn't know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.""The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, ""Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan's National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied.In fact, Pakistan's govt representatives have officially denied this on record. ""IAEA's statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless. Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served as deputy director general military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI, ""Hitting any nuclear installation is a very irresponsible thing to do, which the highly professional Indian forces will never do. All these stories are bogus conspiracy theories that can't be believed.""He added, ""Above all, both countries in 1988 signed the India-Pakistan Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, or simply called the non-attack agreement. Under this, both maintain an understanding of not attacking each other's nuclear installations as it would then lead to a devastating armed escalation. Having said that, our forces are fully ready to respond to any misadventure by Pakistan.

"Operation Sindoor: How India delivered devastating blow to Pakistan’s air defence with dummy jets, BrahMos missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-how-india-delivered-devastating-blow-to-pakistans-air-defence-with-dummy-jets-brahmos-missiles/articleshow/121192203.cms,"brahmos missile

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor.

Won’t permit any challenge to 1995 Waqf Act: SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it will on May 20 hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners who have challenged the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, only for the purpose of deciding the necessity and contours of any interim order required to be issued by the court.SG Tushar Mehta said govt has filed a comprehensive affidavit on the three issues flagged by the court in its April 17 order: nomination of non-Muslims to Central Waqf Council and boards, validity of waqf-by-user without valid documents, and the process for identification of govt land under waqf.Perturbed after seeing a number of senior advocates appearing for the Muslim parties and speaking in different voices, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said if merely scheduling the hearing takes so much of time and if this there is so much confusion as to who all should be permitted to argue, then the hearing cannot commence.The bench asked lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal , to coordinate with other counsels who are arguing against the amendments and file by Saturday a consolidated written submission on the need and shape of interim order. It asked Mehta to articulate his response and submissions by Monday.During the hearing, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the court should allow him to argue a petition challenging the Waqf Act, 1995, as well as the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, both of which are discriminatory based on religion. The bench, however, asked, “How can you challenge the 1995 Act after 30 years?”Jain said the petition also challenges certain provisions of the new waqf law as it has not addressed the unequal situation created in favour of Muslims by the 1995 Act.The bench said, “Do not mix the issues. We will not consider any request for stay of any provision of the Waqf Act, 1995. Just because the Amendment Act, 2025 is challenged, no one can be allowed to jump in to challenge the 1995 legislation.”Sibal said the assurance of the Union govt through the solicitor general on certain aspects should continue till May 20. Mehta said it will continue till May 20.","Supreme Court will hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners on May 20.

'Uneducated': BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal slams Tejashwi Yadav's 'sootra' remark on SIR; demands apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uneducated-bjps-sanjay-jaiswal-slams-tejashwi-yadavs-sootra-remark-on-sir-demands-apology/articleshow/122428754.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (Picture from X)

NEW DELHI: Bihar's voter list controversy is snowballing into a political slugfest, with BJP leader Sanjay Jaiswal on Sunday launching a fierce attack on RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav for dismissing reports of illegal foreign nationals being found in the state’s electoral rolls.The ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise by the Election Commission has become a flashpoint between the ruling and opposition camps in Bihar.Reacting sharply to Tejashwi's comments, Jaiswal pulled no punches. Speaking to ANI, he said, ""Only Tejashwi Yadav can make such comments about media personnel or any human being in general. The problem with Tejashwi Yadav is that he is not educated, which is why the people at his home make him memorise whatever they want, and he just repeats it. But if someone asks him a question outside of that, he will create this kind of mess. ""Calling the RJD leader ""uneducated and irresponsible,"" Jaiswal demanded a public apology. ""Tejashwi Yadav should publicly apologise, express regret, and take an oath that he will not say anything beyond what he is taught at home,"" he added.The war of words escalated after Tejashwi rubbished reports suggesting that Bangladeshis, Nepalis, and even people from Myanmar had been detected as voters in Bihar during the Election Commission’s house-to-house verification.""Who are these sources?"" Tejashwi asked. Mocking the credibility of the reports, he said, ""These are the same sources that said Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore have been captured.""He further added,Tejashwi also questioned the timing and intent of the revision. ""SIR was conducted for the last time in 2003 under the UPA government. Since then, we have seen many elections, including the ones in 2014, 2019, and 2024. In those elections, we lost by three to four lakhs. Does that mean all these foreigners voted for PM Modi?... This means that the NDA are at fault for any dubious elements' names getting added to the voter lists. ""He went on to claim that the process was politically motivated. ""That means all the elections they have won have been a fraud... SIR is a complete eyewash. The EC is working as a cell of a political party.""Earlier, news agency PTI quoted Election Commission officials as saying that field-level teams had identified “a large number” of suspected foreign nationals, mainly from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, during the verification drive.As Bihar heads toward assembly elections later this year, the Election Commission’s SIR effort to clean up the electoral rolls has taken center stage, and may set the tone for a nationwide scrutiny of voter lists, particularly with a focus on verifying individuals’ place of birth.",Bihar's voter list controversy is snowballing into a political slugfest.

Axiom-4’s science and outreach success





What’s next for him





How he’ll cope with Earth’s gravity

A landmark mission for India

NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla , the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS), is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.The Dragon spacecraft, carrying Shukla and fellow crew members Commander Peggy Whitson, ESA astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu, is scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday at 4:30 pm IST, with splashdown expected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California around 3:00 pm IST on Tuesday. The journey back is expected to last approximately 22 hours.The Ax-4 farewell ceremony was held aboard the ISS on Sunday evening, also attended by members of Nasa 's Expedition 73. Speaking at the event, Shukla reflected on his experience: “It almost seems magical to me... It has been a fantastic journey for me.” Channeling the iconic words of Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut in space, he added, “Even today, Bharat looks 'saare jahan se accha' from above.”In Lucknow, anticipation is high. Shukla’s mother, Asha Shukla, told ANI, “We pray to God that he completes his mission successfully and comes back to Earth as soon as possible and meets us… We will give him a grand welcome.”His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, confirmed the flight timeline, saying, “We were waiting for this, so we are happy that he is coming back. We pray to God that he comes back safely.”Asha added that she is preparing all his favourite dishes: “He told us that this time, after coming back, he wants to eat everything he hasn't had in the past five-six years due to being abroad.”Before launch, Shukla had packed mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa for his time in space, saying, “There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa with me.”Launched on June 25 from Nasa ’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a Falcon-9 rocket, Axiom-4 docked with the ISS on June 26. Over 18 days, the team carried out more than 60 experiments, including studies on human health, space agriculture, mental well-being, and space suit materials. The mission will return with over 580 pounds of cargo, including scientific equipment and research samples.Shukla focused on testing glucose monitors in microgravity, contributing to efforts aimed at enabling diabetic individuals to participate in future space missions.In his final remarks from space, Shukla said, “I carry with me a lot of memories and learnings. But what stays with me most is what humanity can achieve when we all come together for a common goal.” He also thanked ISRO, Nasa , SpaceX, and Axiom Space, and acknowledged the contributions of Indian students and researchers to the mission’s outreach goals.After splashdown, Shukla and his crewmates will be transported to Nasa ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will undergo post-landing protocols under medical supervision before being cleared for return to their home countries.He will undergo a series of medical and psychological evaluations, covering physical fitness, balance, reflexes, cardiovascular function, and immune response. Nasa ’s Human Health and Performance team will lead the assessments.Shukla will also be debriefed on his mission experience and the experiments he conducted. This data will aid both Axiom and ISRO as they plan future collaborative space missions. He is expected to be formally recognised by Indian scientific institutions, including ISRO and the Indian Air Force, and may receive honours from government bodies for his achievements in space exploration.After spending over two weeks in microgravity, Shukla’s body will need time to readjust to Earth’s gravity. Space travel leads to temporary loss of bone density and muscle mass, along with fluid redistribution that affects blood circulation and organ function.Nasa specialists note that astronauts often experience symptoms such as ""puffy face,"" ""chicken legs,"" vision changes, and even increased height during the early days in space. Upon return, rehabilitation protocols kick in. These include compression garments to stabilise blood pressure, hydration with salt tablets and water, and physical therapy to rebuild strength, coordination, and balance.According to Dr. Dervay from Nasa, “Almost every organ system in the body is impacted to some degree – whether it's the skin, the neurovestibular, the bone, muscle, the immunological system, the cardiovascular system.”However, Nasa says no extraordinary measures are needed in Shukla’s case. “We don’t see any need for any special precaution,” said Dina Contella, deputy manager of Nasa’s ISS Program. “Like any astronauts coming back, there is an acclimation period, and so that will vary by crew member.”Shukla’s recovery will also help space agencies better understand the impact of short-duration missions, crucial for long-term exploration goals such as missions to the Moon and Mars.Shukla’s mission is being seen as a symbolic and scientific milestone in India’s space journey. Coming ahead of ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission, it represents India’s growing presence in international space collaboration. At the farewell, Shukla noted, “If we decide, then even stars are attainable (taara api prapyante).”As he prepares to step back on Earth, Shukla brings not just research findings and experience, but a message of aspiration, unity, and national pride.(With inputs from agencies)","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS) He is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.

According to police, around 2,500 personnel will be deployed during the Yatra. Fourteen deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) will be on duty, and 28 checkpoints have been set up at various locations along the route. Videography and strict checking will be carried out at these checkpoints to prevent the entry of miscreants.

Additional measures include the deployment of mounted police, sniffer dogs, bomb disposal squads, four drones, 21 video cameras, and commando units, they added.

All government and private schools in the district will remain closed.

District Magistrate Vishram Kumar Meena issued orders prohibiting the carrying of all weapons, including licensed arms, firearms, swords, sticks, tridents, rods, knives, and chains. Only the kirpan, worn as a religious symbol by members of the Sikh community, has been exempted.

The use of DJs, loudspeakers, or any sound-amplifying devices with provocative content that could hurt the sentiments of any community will be strictly prohibited.

Meat shops along the Kanwar route are to remain closed till July 24.

According to police, cow vigilante Bittu Bajrangi has been denied permission to attend the Yatra, and his social media accounts have been suspended.

The sale of petrol or diesel in open containers such as bottles will be prohibited at fuel stations in Nuh district from 6 am to 12 noon on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Authorities on Monday suspended mobile internet and bulk SMS services in Haryana's Nuh district to prevent any communal tension ahead of the annual Braj Mandal Jalabhishek Yatra.The preventive measures come in the backdrop of the 2023 procession, which led to deadly communal clashes in the district, claiming six lives.According to the Haryana government’s order, the move is aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation and rumours through social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and X, and to curb any mobilisation of agitators or demonstrators who could indulge in arson, vandalism, or other violent activities, leading to loss of life and property.""No attention should be paid to any kind of rumours. Strict action should be taken against those spreading misinformation,"" Meena said, adding that a special team will monitor social media to curb any attempts to vitiate the atmosphere.Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Sanjay Kumar reviewed the security arrangements and directed officials from the civil and police administration to coordinate closely.","Authorities suspend mobile internet and bulk SMS services in Haryana's Nuh district to prevent any communal tension ahead of the annual Braj Mandal Jalabhishek Yatra.

Major airstrike by Russia



Sanctions on Russia?



US will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine







US President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a sharp rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine.Responding to the reporters, Trump said, ""I am very disappointed with President Putin. I thought he was somebody that meant what he said. And he'll talk so beautifully and then he'll bomb people at night. We don't like that.""His remarks came after Russia launched its fourth major airstrike this month, targeting several western Ukrainian cities.According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , the Russian assault involved 597 drones and 26 missiles, killing two people, injuring 20, and damaging civilian infrastructure from Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast to Lviv, Lutsk, and Chernivtsi in the west.Asked whether the US would impose sanctions on Russia, Trump replied, ""We're going to see what we will see tomorrow. Okay. We have the secretary general. As you know, Europe has announced sanctions. But I am very disappointed with President Putin.""A bipartisan group of US senators is pushing a sanctions bill that would give Trump broad powers to hit Russia with what they call ""sledgehammer"" measures. While Trump has so far held off, hoping to convince Putin to end the war through diplomacy, recent developments suggest his position may be shifting.During a cabinet meeting, he said, ""I'm looking at it very strongly.""A major announcement is expected Monday, when Trump will address the Russia situation and meet Nato secretary general Mark Rutte in Washington. At the same time, US special envoy Keith Kellogg will begin a new visit to Ukraine.Trump also confirmed that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv. ""We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,"" he said. ""I haven't agreed on the number yet, but they're going to have some because they do need protection.""This marks a reversal from the White House's earlier consideration to pause some arms deliveries. A new deal is now in the works that would involve Nato paying the US for the weapons sent to Ukraine.""We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they're going to pay us 100 percent for them,"" Trump said. ""It'll be business for us.""With the war in Ukraine now stretching into its fourth year and Russian strikes intensifying, Trump’s latest statements suggest a possible turning point, combining military support, diplomatic pressure, and the looming threat of economic sanctions against Moscow.","US President Donald Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine.

MIT years: A dual degree and deeper specialisation

Real-world experience across leading tech firms

Founding Windsurf: Where AI meets developer workflows

The $2.4 billion deal with Google

In July 2025, Google signed a $2.4 billion deal for a nonexclusive licence to the technologies developed by Windsurf, a cutting-edge AI startup co-founded by Varun Mohan. Along with the deal, Mohan and several core members of his team joined Google DeepMind, marking one of the most high-profile movements in the AI talent landscape this year.This landmark agreement not only validated Windsurf’s innovation in AI-powered software development but also brought global attention to Mohan’s exceptional trajectory. His journey from a math Olympiad enthusiast in high school to an MIT-trained engineer and AI entrepreneur is a story rooted deeply in education, vision, and technical mastery.Born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, Mohan is the son of Indian-origin parents who instilled in him the value of rigorous learning from an early age. He attended The Harker School in San Jose, a school known for nurturing bright minds in science and technology. Here, he developed a reputation as a math and computing Olympiad achiever, excelling in competitions that tested both analytical depth and speed.Mohan was not just performing well academically. He was exploring the boundaries of computational thinking, often creating solutions to problems that went well beyond classroom material.Mohan’s academic promise led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he enrolled in the prestigious Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) program. Between 2014 and 2017, he completed both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in EECS, a challenging combination that only a few students pursue.At MIT, Mohan chose to specialise in operating systems, distributed computing, machine learning, performance engineering, and algorithms. His graduate work was marked by a strong blend of theory and hands-on experimentation, especially in building systems that could operate at scale.This academic foundation was instrumental in shaping his long-term vision: a world where artificial intelligence could assist humans in coding, debugging, and designing software—making development faster, smarter, and more accessible.Following his graduation from MIT, Mohan took a thoughtful approach to building experience. He worked at some of the top technology companies in the world, including LinkedIn, Quora, Nuro, Samsung, and Databricks. Across these roles, he gained practical insights into backend systems, machine learning infrastructure, robotics, and big data platforms.Each job added a new layer to his expertise and deepened his understanding of the challenges developers face when working with large-scale systems. It also reinforced his belief that existing development tools needed a fundamental overhaul—something only AI could deliver.In 2021, Varun Mohan co-founded Codeium, later rebranded as Windsurf, with his MIT classmate and close friend Douglas Chen. Initially focused on GPU virtualisation, the company soon pivoted to its breakthrough idea: an AI-native IDE (Integrated Development Environment) capable of helping developers write, refactor, and understand code using large language models.Under Mohan’s leadership, Windsurf gained enormous traction in a short time. It onboarded over a million developers within four months, raised $243 million in funding, and reached a valuation of $1.25 billion. The platform’s core innovation lay in its use of agentic workflows, where AI tools like Cascade could automate routine development tasks while keeping engineers focused on architecture and strategy.In one of the biggest AI deals of 2025, Google entered into a $2.4 billion agreement to license Windsurf’s technologies. Though it did not acquire the company outright, Google welcomed Varun Mohan and key members of his team into Google DeepMind. The move positions Mohan at the heart of Google’s efforts to lead the future of AI-assisted software development.The structure of the deal also means Windsurf can continue to operate independently, licensing its tools to other enterprise clients. This hybrid model of licensing plus talent integration is seen as a blueprint for future collaboration between startups and tech giants.At the core of Varun Mohan’s success lies a consistent thread: education as a launchpad. Whether it was the competitive environment of Harker School, the academic intensity of MIT, or the deep technical exposure across companies like Databricks and Quora, every stage built upon the last.Mohan’s story shows that deep learning—of the academic kind—is still one of the most powerful tools for shaping the future of technology. While AI may now assist in writing code, it was a strong human foundation in mathematics, systems thinking, and research that enabled Mohan to imagine that future in the first place.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

LONDON: Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government.“This report is wrong. We don’t accept it,” said Ameen Siddiqui, whose British brother-in-law and Gloucestershire resident Akeel Nanabawa, died alongside his wife Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter Sara in the June 12 crash of the Ahmedabad-London flight.Speaking to the UK’s The Telegraph from Surat, Siddiqui alleged that “they want to blame dead pilots who can’t defend themselves”. Siddiqui added that he had rejected Air India ’s compensation offer and would take the airline to court for “killing our family members”.UK law firms are already representing families of dozens of passengers who died in the AI 171 crash and considering legal action against Boeing and Air India.Tushar Joge, whose male cousin’s in-laws, Vallabh Nagji Agheda and wife Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, both in their 70s, died in the crash, echoed the claim that the probe report was a “cover-up” for Air India and Boeing.“We were pre-empting that they would start blaming the pilots.Why are they not looking for a mechanical fault? How qualified are the people in the Indian Air Accident Investigation Bureau? The FAA (US aviation regulator) gave an advisory in 2018 to check the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. Shouldn’t they have made this a mandatory requirement rather than an advisory?” Joge asked.The Agheda couple were coming to the UK to spend time with their youngest daughter and her family in Reading. Speaking to TOI from Vadodara, their son-in-law said: “It does not look like it’s the pilot’s fault. It could be Boeing’s design fault with the switches, or it could be Air India’s maintenance issues. Most of the families believe it’s a problem withthe aircraft. Air India is helping us with compensation but we are more concerned about getting the right report. We want the truth to make sure another disaster doesn’t happen.”Imtiyaz Ali Syed, whose London-based brother Javed died with his wife and two children lamented that the probe report was replete with “aviation jargon praising Boeing’s systems” while saying “nothing conclusive”. “Everyone, Air India, Boeing, government, has something to protect. But we have lost our entire families. How can we move on without the truth?” Imtiyaz asked.Sameer Rafik, cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik from Leicester, told the BBC he did not trust the Indian government. “Until the airline provides the cockpit recording to us, I’m not going to believe the report,” Rafik said.","Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government. “This report is wrong.

First Somvar Vrat in Sawan 2025: Do’s and Don’ts for attracting success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/others/first-somvar-vrat-in-sawan-2025-dos-and-donts-for-attracting-success/articleshow/122408446.cms,"1. Ignoring the Purity of Food (Vrat Bhojan)

2. Treating the Fast as a Diet or Social Trend

3. Neglecting the Timing and Simplicity of Rituals

4. Not Preparing Mentally or Emotionally

5. Overlooking Consistency and Closure

Sawan Somvar, the Mondays that fall during the holy month of Sawan (Shravan), are among the most spiritually potent days for Lord Shiva devotees. In 2025, the first Sawan Somvar falls on July 14, setting the tone for a month filled with devotion, fasting, prayer, and rituals. Observing Sawan Somvar vrat (fast) is believed to bring blessings in health, relationships, and spiritual evolution. However, many devotees—especially beginners—unknowingly commit mistakes that dilute the spiritual essence or disrupt the intended discipline of the fast.Let us explore the five most common mistakes people make while observing the Sawan Somvar vrat, particularly on the first Monday. Whether you're a first-time devotee or a seasoned follower, avoiding these pitfalls will help you experience the true sanctity and power of the vrat.One of the most common mistakes is consuming the wrong type of food during the fast. The spiritual and energetic purity of vrat bhojan (fasting food) is essential during Sawan Somvar. Many people unknowingly include ingredients that are strictly prohibited during this fast, such as salt (including rock salt in some traditions), grains, pulses, or processed food items that contain additives not aligned with fasting norms.Even ingredients like onion, garlic, or table salt, which are typically avoided in most Hindu vrats, are sometimes used by mistake. These items are considered tamasic, meaning they increase lethargy, emotional disturbance, and cloud spiritual clarity. Instead, vrat foods should be sattvic—simple, fresh, and full of pranic energy. Commonly accepted items include fruits, milk, yoghurt, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes, sabudana (tapioca pearls), kuttu (buckwheat), singhara (water chestnut flour), and fresh coconut water.Additionally, cooking utensils should be clean and separate from those used for regular meals. If possible, prepare food with a calm, meditative mind, ideally chanting or listening to Shiva mantras while cooking. This brings vibrational alignment to your offering and enhances the purity of your fast.In the age of wellness culture and social media trends, fasting during Sawan is sometimes mistaken for a detox diet or spiritual fad. While the health benefits of Sawan vrat are real—such as digestive rest, hormonal balance, and mental clarity—the spiritual purpose far outweighs the physical.A common mistake is fasting without internal intention. People may skip meals but remain angry, anxious, or distracted throughout the day. They may even indulge in screen time or gossip, defeating the purpose of inner purification. Remember, Sawan Somvar vrat is not merely about abstaining from food—it’s about disciplining the body and elevating the mind.Lord Shiva represents stillness, introspection, and transcendence. Fasting during Sawan is symbolic of withdrawing from worldly indulgences to connect with that inner silence. Even if you’re only fasting partially, approach it with the bhava (intention) of surrender, not as a checkbox or challenge. This small shift transforms the vrat into a sacred offering.Another frequent mistake is not honouring the time-specific rituals associated with Sawan Somvar. Many people perform puja at random times or rush through it without understanding its flow. In Vedic tradition, timing (muhurta) is key to maximising the spiritual current of any practice.For example, the Brahma Muhurat (around 4:00–6:00 AM) is considered the best time to bathe and begin prayers. Ideally, one should perform Abhishek (ritual bath of the Shivling) in the early hours and continue with mantra chanting or silent meditation throughout the day.Another mistake is over-complication of the puja itself. While elaborate rituals have their place, they are not necessary for everyone. Devotees often get caught up in externalities—types of milk, exact numbers of Bilva leaves, arrangement of flowers—and forget the inner devotion. Lord Shiva, known as Bhola Bhandari, accepts even a single drop of water with pure devotion.If you're unsure about the full puja process, keep it simple. Offer clean water or milk to the Shivling, chant “Om Namah Shivaya” 108 times, light a lamp, and sit in silence for a few minutes. This minimalist approach, done with sincerity, can be more spiritually rewarding than a mechanical, elaborate ritual.Many people enter the Sawan vrat without preparing themselves mentally or emotionally. Fasting is not just a physical act—it is a form of tapasya (austerity), which requires inner stability and intention. If the fast is observed while carrying resentment, stress, or emotional volatility, the very purpose of calming the mind is defeated.Emotional and mental preparation begins the night before. Avoid arguments, heavy meals, or overstimulation (like binge-watching or overuse of social media). Instead, read or listen to stories of Lord Shiva, chant mantras, or journal your intentions for the vrat.On the day of the fast, be mindful of your thoughts, reactions, and speech. Speak kindly, forgive easily, and maintain a gentle pace throughout the day. These subtler aspects often go unnoticed but play a huge role in the success of your vrat. Remember, the energy you carry is the offering you make.One last mistake is starting with great enthusiasm but failing to maintain consistency throughout the month. Devotees often fast diligently on the first Sawan Somvar but gradually become lax in the following weeks. The initial energy is not sustained, and the spiritual build-up is interrupted.Sawan is about accumulative energy—each Monday deepens your alignment with Shiva. Missing fasts or treating subsequent Mondays casually reduces this cumulative effect. To avoid this, plan your Mondays in advance. Set reminders, prepare simple sattvic food the night before, and create a supportive environment that encourages continuity.Another often-overlooked aspect is closing the vrat with gratitude and reflection. At the end of the day, offer a final prayer expressing what the vrat meant to you, what you learned, or how you felt. Thank Lord Shiva for the strength and clarity to observe the fast. This simple act of reflection seals the spiritual energy and allows it to integrate into your life.","In 2025, the first Sawan Somvar falls on July 14, setting the tone for a month filled with devotion, fasting, prayer, and rituals.

Odisha horror: Student sets self ablaze after HoD’s sexual harassment; says he threatened to lower marks if she didn’t give in; in critical condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/harassed-by-teacher-college-student-sets-herself-ablaze-is-critical/articleshow/122410179.cms,"Poll Should stricter laws be enforced against sexual harassment in educational institutions? Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.





BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment. A forensic team visited the site, and a detailed investigation is underway. ""Law and order is being strictly maintained on the college campus,"" Naik said.","A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises.

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","Pilots' union slams ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423964,imgsize-1785791,width-400,resizemode-4/122423964.jpg"

Tejashwi Yadav Questions Validity Of 80% Bihar Voter Forms, Flags ECI Silence On Fake Uploads

Official: Poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner

PATNA: Bihar’s ongoing special intensive revision of electoral rolls has unearthed an unspecified number of illegal immigrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar residing in the state and aiming to become voters with Aadhaar, ration cards and domicile certificates acquired through fraud, Election Commission sources said Sunday based on reports from booth-level officers.The purported findings of the door-to-door voter verification campaign have already become a political hot potato, with RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav dismissing these as “rubbish”. EC is still to make an official statement.Officials said that the final poll rolls would be purged of anyone flagged as a foreigner during the survey.The rolls are to be published on Sept 30. The house-to-house verification exercise started on June 25 with the focus on verifying places of birth. Teams conducting the survey have found “a considerable number of people from neighbouring countries” during their visits across the state, sources said.Tejashwi, leader of opposition in the state assembly, held a presser in Patna to question the credibility of the sources behind the “claim” that foreigners had infiltrated the rolls with fake papers.“Has Election Commission issued any document or press release on the matter? This claim is based on ‘sources’ whom I have no reason to believe,” he said.BJP shot back, saying Tejashwi and the rest of the opposition were “nervous” about losing their allegedly “illegal vote base”. “If Tejashwi had his way, he would allow citizens from Bangladesh and Pakistan to vote through postal ballots. No wonder the intensive rolls revision has left the entire opposition worried,” said state BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma.He accused RJD supporters of helping illegal immigrants get their names included in the rolls. “Why else is Tejashwi concerned about illegal migrants being weeded out, but not Bihari migrants outside the state who have still to be included in the electoral rolls?""",Official: Poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner during the survey.

Search stretched from Nigam Bodh Ghat to Noida

Emotional distress a key factor

Investigation and post-mortem underway

NEW DELHI: The body of 19-year-old Sneha Debnath, a Delhi University student who went missing on July 7, was recovered from the Yamuna River under the Geeta Colony flyover, Delhi Police confirmed on Sunday. The discovery marks a tragic end to a week-long search operation that began after a suspected suicide note was found at her residence, ANI repoted.Sneha, a resident of South Delhi’s Paryavaran Complex and a B.Sc. Mathematics (Honours) student at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, had reportedly told close friends and family through messages and emails on the morning of her disappearance that she was in emotional distress.According to investigators, Sneha’s family discovered a note indicating her intention to jump off the Signature Bridge. A cab driver later confirmed he had dropped her there on the same day. Technical surveillance placed her last known phone location at the bridge, while eyewitnesses also reported seeing a girl standing alone at the edge of the bridge around sunrise.Moments later, she was no longer in sight.Police registered an FIR at Mehrauli Police Station under Section 140(3) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).A joint operation with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was launched, covering a wide area along the Yamuna, from Nigam Bodh Ghat to Noida. The operation led to the recovery of a female body that matched Sneha’s physical description and clothing.“We had been conducting an extensive search since July 7. The body recovered matches the description shared by her family,” a senior police official said.Friends close to Sneha revealed she had been withdrawn and visibly upset in recent months.

From having legs hacked off to getting Rajya Sabha foothold: A Master's journey of grit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-having-legs-hacked-off-to-getting-rajya-sabha-foothold-a-masters-journey-of-grit/articleshow/122424644.cms,"File photo: Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: It was May 2016. Speaking at a rally in Kasaragod, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held up the hand of C Sadanandan Master as he lamented the silence imposed on the story of the victim of barbaric poll violence. Coming from a family of hardcore CPM members, the 30-year-old school teacher was influenced by the writings of poet Akkitham and turned into a votary of RSS's philosophy of cultural nationalism. He was dubbed a traitor by his comrades, who punished the defection by hacking off both his legs in 1994. The limbs were mutilated so that they could not be rejoined. The PM breached the ""silence"" on Sunday that he complained about nine years ago by announcing Sadanandan Master's nomination to Rajya Sabha - a move that lakhs of members and sympathisers of RSS would applaud.For, if the atrocity was meant to intimidate him into submission, the attackers failed miserably. Sadanandan, popularly known as Master or 'Maashay', who is now dependent on his prosthetic legs, did not let the gruesome attack deter him from taking on the powerful CPM in their stronghold of Kannur and elsewhere, and propagating Hindutva. Importantly, he has been arguing against the use of violence to settle political and ideological disagreements.If the recognition of Sadanandan Master helps explain his enduring appeal among lay supporters of RSS, the PM gave them another reason to celebrate on Sunday: the nomination of historian Meenakshi Jain. Part of the rare breed that challenged the dominant Left historiography, Jain had to endure resistance and ridicule in academic circles. She, however, earned the admiration of Hindutva circles by detailing the destruction of temples in the medieval period, a taboo area for 'mainstream' historians. Her books - 'Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples', 'The Battle for Rama: Case of the Temple at Ayodhya', and 'Rama and Ayodhya' - are evidence of the tenacity with which she pursued her passion. Ujjwal Nikam , the Mumbai lawyer who successfully argued for death penalty for Ajmal Kasab of 26/11 infamy and had earlier argued the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case, is not known for his links with RSS. Yet, his nomination appears to be part of Modi rewarding those who turn out to be symbols of the cause.Ditto for Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the career diplomat who served as foreign secretary under Modi 2.0. He was seen as BJP's choice for the Darjeeling LS seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections before the leadership deferred to the in-house wisdom that the incumbent be retained. The PM may have gone along with the majority view, but did not let the former ambassador slip off his radar.A Leftist-turned-RSS karyakarta, Sadanandan Master's life has been one of sacrifices and a symbol of resilience and unwavering public service in the face of a brutal political attack on him in 1994 in Kannur. For 31 years, Sadanandan Master has been living with these scars when CPM workers severed both his legs, mutilated them on the surface of the road so that he couldn't undergo limb replantation and left him writhing in pain.The brutal attack didn't deter Sadanandan Master as he returned to his teaching job and social service on prosthetic legs. He has consistently spoken out against political violence, especially in Kannur, and has advocated peace and dialogue.""The psychology of violence is that of action and reaction. I am a victim of political violence, and I have always maintained that in my individual capacity, I am willing to take on any role to end this violence,"" he had told TOI in 2016.Sadanandan Master unsuccessfully contested the 2016 and 2021 assembly elections in Kerala on a BJP ticket from the Koothuparambu constituency in Kannur district. Currently, he is the vice president of BJP's Kerala unit.","C Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha.

GUWAHATI: Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I, the banned anti-talks faction of the original militant outfit of the same name that he co-founded in 1979, claimed Sunday that three of its senior members were killed in targeted pre-dawn drone attacks by the Indian Army on some ""mobile camps"" in Myanmar's Sagaing region.The Army officially denied carrying out any such aerial attacks on the camps purportedly shared by Ulfa-I and Manipur's Revolutionary People's Front (RPF) across a stretch of the India-Myanmar border, adjoining Longwa in Nagaland and Pangsau Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.Ulfa-I said the attacks came in waves between 2 am and 4 am - involving over 150 drones of Israeli and French make - and resulted in the outfit losing insurgent veterans Nayan Asom, Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom. The last two were killed in the second drone strike while attending Nayan's funeral, while 19 members were wounded, the outfit said.""There are no inputs with the Indian Army on such an operation,"" defence ministry PRO Lt Col Mahendra Rawat told TOI in Guwahati.Ulfa-I contested the statement, specifying that three drone attacks took place in the span of two hours. The outfit said residents of the border belt in Arunachal Pradesh would testify to the attacks.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who started his stint in office with an offer of talks to Ulfa-I, and state police denied any involvement or knowledge of operations against the outfit. They said there could be clarity on Ulfa-I's claim as more information arrives from the remote border.A source in the security establishment confirmed casualties in the Ulfa-I camps in Myanmar, suggesting the attacks could be the outcome of the civil war in that country with several ethnic armed groups at heart of the strife."" The ongoing civil war there has led to frequent clashes, shifting alliances and a general breakdown of state control in many areas, particularly near the international border,"" the source said. ""In this environment, attacks on insurgent camps - including those used by Ulfa-I - could plausibly originate from Myanmar's own ethnic armed organisations, or even the Myanmar military, rather than by Indian forces.""Insurgent outfits of the Northeast have had a presence in Myanmar since the late Eighties, taking advantage of the porous border and ongoing conflict there.Indian security agencies have repeatedly expressed concern over the use of Myanmarese territory by militants for hit-and-run attacks in the Northeast. There have been instances of unconfirmed Indian military action on militants across the border on several occasions.Ulfa-I's camps are said to be in the dense forests of Sagaing, with additional bases at Waktham Basti, Hoyat Basti and Hakiyot (opposite Longding district of Arunachal). Some camps are near the Pangmi Naga-inhabited area, and along the China-Myanmar border. Manipur-based groups, including Manipur outfits like People's Liberation Army (PLA), KYKL and PREPAK. RPF is the political wing of PLA.The NSCN-K(YA) faction has its headquarters and camps in Naga-inhabited regions of Sagaing, often within a 6 to 10km radius of the other militant bases.

Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to Know

NAGPUR: The jalebi might soon come with a guilt trip. The samosa, a side of shame. And your chai biscuit? A health warning on the wall behind it.The health ministry has ordered all central institutions, including AIIMS Nagpur, to install ""oil and sugar boards"" - vivid posters spelling out how much hidden fat and sugar lurk in everyday snacks. It's a first step toward treating junk food like tobacco.The boards aim to act as quiet but pointed reminders in govt institutions, alerting citizens to the sugar and oil content in snacks considered cultural staples. A laddoo, a vada pav, a pakora - all under scrutiny. AIIMS Nagpur officials confirmed the directive. Cafeterias and public areas will soon display the warnings. ""It's the beginning of food labelling becoming as serious as cigarette warnings,"" said Amar Amale, president of Cardiological Society of India's Nagpur chapter. ""Sugar and trans fats are the new tobacco. People deserve to know what they're eating.""Govt's internal note draws a sharp line under the country's growing obesity crisis. More than 44.9 crore Indians are projected to be overweight or obese by 2050 - placing the country second only to the US. Already, one in five urban adults is overweight. The rise in childhood obesity, driven by poor diet and low activity, deepens the concern.""This is not about banning food,"" said senior diabetologist Sunil Gupta. ""But if people knew that one gulab jamun might contain five teaspoons of sugar, they might think twice before going for seconds."" Doctors and health advocates see this as part of the broader war on non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, many of which are linked to diet.Nagpur will be among the first to reflect that shift - not with bans, but with bold, visual nudges. Near every tempting snack, a colourful sign will watch over: ""Eat wisely.

NEW DELHI: In a special message read out at a day-long conference organised here to mark his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama said ""we Tibet ans"" are deeply indebted to the govt and people of India for the warm hospitality they have shown since 1959, even as he indirectly questioned China's claim over Tibet.The Tibetan spiritual leader recalled how it had been more than 66 years since a large number of Tibetans, including him, fled to India following the ""Chinese Communist invasion of Tibet"".Referring to India as ""Arya Bhumi"" in his written message read out at the conference by his confidant and noted scholar Samdhong Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama said that ""here (India) I have enjoyed the freedom and opportunity to continue my studies of ancient Indian wisdom"". He felt a ""special closeness"" to India, which, over and above being the world's most populous country and the largest democracy, is the land of the Buddha, the place where he attained enlightenment, he added.Reflecting on the profound impact the 14th Dalai Lama has had on the world, a declaration adopted at the conference organised by International Buddhist Confederation and attended by nearly 500 participants, including renowned Buddhist monks and scholars, hailed him for having consistently championed the preservation of the rich Tibetan culture and religious freedom.""His (Dalai Lama) recent statement announcing the continuation of his reincarnation, and only by Tibetan people without any foreign interference is a testament of preserving its culture and heritage,"" the declaration stated. ""His wisdom in safeguarding the sacred institution of the Dalai Lama - particularly his clear and courageous stance on its future - stands as a beacon of spiritual integrity in the modern world,"" it said.In his message, the Dalai Lama added, ""I believe that if aspects of India's ancient wisdom, of which the Buddha's teachings are a part, are combined with modern education they can make a beneficial contribution to greater peace and happiness in the world"".Recalling that soon after ""we Tibetans"" came to India, the Dalai Lama said the Indian govt actively supported establishment of schools for Tibetan children to receive modern education while also learning about Tibetan culture and traditions.","The Tibetan spiritual leader recalled how it had been more than 66 years since a large number of Tibetans, including him, fled to India following the ""Chinese Communist invasion of Tibet"" He felt a ""special closeness"" to India, which, over and above being the world's most populous country and the largest democracy, is the land of the Buddha, he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122425696,imgsize-1145638,width-400,resizemode-4/122425696.jpg"

He confirmed that 10 of the arrested are residents of other states.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, “Under this campaign, the police took action in various police station areas on Saturday and arrested 23 fake babas roaming around in the guise of saints and sadhus. Among the arrested fake babas, 10 persons are residents of other states.”The CM instructed all station in-charges to identify such individuals and take firm action. Police say these fake seers often target women and young people, promising solutions to personal or domestic problems, only to defraud them.“In line with the instructions, all the station in-charges have been instructed to identify such persons in their respective police station areas, who disguise themselves as saints and mislead people, especially women and youth, and lure them to solve their personal or domestic problems and commit fraud with them, and take strict action against them,” Singh told ANI.Hindu religious bodies have welcomed the campaign, describing it as necessary to protect the sanctity of Sanatan Dharma. They called for strict punishment for those misusing religion for personal gain.Ravindra Puri, President of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, supported the move and emphasised the need to safeguard Kanwariyas from fraud.“Kanwar is being conducted in Haridwar and we welcome this decision by the Chief Minister and thank him as well...

Our Chief Minister's vision is a safe Uttarakhand, and doing justice to all the Kanwariya and all of us are with him,” Puri said.The Akhand Parshuram Akhada also extended support, urging authorities to verify the identity of such individuals.“We welcome this campaign... There are some fake seers who bring disgrace to our respected saints, the Aadhar card of such imposters should be checked... While India is about to become Vishwaguru, only original saints must be there... There are some seers (fake ones) who have committed a crime, and action must be taken on such people...” said its president.State BJP President Mahendra Bhatt also said that anyone trying to disrupt social harmony should be subjected to strict action.“Some criminal elements try to ruin social environment.

CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

KOLKATA: A forensic team collected Sunday soft drink and water bottles, two types of hair strands, and other samples from a sealed hostel room in a premier Kolkata management institute, where a 24-year-old psychologist accused a student of drugging and raping her during a supposed counselling session. However, the probe hit a wall as the ""woman and her family refused to cooperate"".""In an ideal situation, we would have spoken to the survivor at length, got her medico-legal test done, and collected her clothes and phone, which are all crucial evidence in such a probe.

But the case took a turn within 12 hours of the complaint when her father publicly denied any crime had occurred and accused police of coercion.

What followed the tragedy was a heartwarming tale of a community turning into a family.Orphaned, yet surrounded by love, little Nikita still looks for her mother in the crowd of familiar and unfamiliar faces but gentle hands and kind eyes try to fill the void.There was no dearth of hearts reaching out to adopt her but Nikita's relatives decided Sunday, after her parents' last rites - she would live with her paternal aunt, Kirna Devi.

The baby's 24-year-old mother, Radha Devi, and 59-year-old grandmother, Poornu Devi, were also washed away. No trace has been found of them.Talwara village lay devastated.

And the entire community reached out to the orphaned child.When word got around, Nikita's relatives and the Mandi district administration began receiving calls from couples, even from abroad, to adopt her.

Martyrs Day clampdown: ‘Jammu and Kashmir government under detention’ to prevent visits to graveyard; CM calls it a ‘shame’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyrs-day-clampdown-jammu-and-kashmir-government-under-detention-to-prevent-visits-to-graveyard-cm-calls-it-a-shame/articleshow/122423538.cms,"File photo: J&K CM Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah was barred Sunday from visiting a graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar, and most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others to keep them away from the site, virtually putting the National Conference (NC) govt under lockdown.Among the other key political figures J&K police confined to their homes were Omar’s father and NC president Farooq Abdullah, former ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone.Omar called the restrictions a “shame” and described “13th July massacre as our Jallianwala Bagh” as he slammed the first such clampdown since his govt took charge in Oct 2024. The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, an arrangement that took shape after the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370.Nasir Aslam Wani, Omar’s political adviser, said the CM had been outside J&K and returned to Srinagar on Sunday but was not allowed to proceed towards Naqshband Sahib, the resting place of 22 people killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh on July 13, 1931. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history.According to Wani, Omar remained in his house after being stopped. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC was in Jammu but his Srinagar house was locked.Wani said he himself had been shut in since 3 am Sunday. “An elected government was placed under house detention in J&K by the very people who hailed the 2024 assembly elections as a triumph of democracy. The irony is not just strange, it is tragic,” NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq told TOI.Omar expressed anger, calling the curbs “blatantly undemocratic” with troops deployed as jailers and major bridges in Srinagar blocked. “I will never understand what the law-and-order govt is so afraid of,” Omar said in a swipe at authorities under LG Sinha.Since early Sunday, authorities shut down major routes. Security was tightened at Gupkar Road, home to top politicians including Farooq, Omar, education minister Sakina Itoo and CPM MLA MY Tarigami. I too posted that she had been “put under house arrest since last (Saturday) night”. The NC head office was sealed with concertina wire. PDP office was shut, too. A popular Sunday flea market in the Lal Chowk area was not allowed. All roads leading to the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib were closed. Senior cops were at the site.Amid the restrictions, Omar sought to counter the established narrative on the 1931 uprising by likening it to Jallianwala Bagh and claiming it was against the British. “The people who laid down their lives did so against the British. Kashmir was being ruled under the British Paramountcy. What a shame that true heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims. We may be denied the opportunity to visit their graves today but we will not forget their sacrifices,” the CM posted.PDP chief Mehbooba called for “acceptance” of the martyrs. “The day you accept our heroes as your own just as Kashmiris have embraced yours, from Mahatma Gandhi to Bhagat Singh, that day, as Prime Minister Modi once said, the dil ki doori (distance of hearts) will truly end,” Mehbooba said. Former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar, also locked in, posted that “it feels like we are in 1931”.In Jammu, the BJP leader of opposition, Sunil Sharma, sought to contest projections of the 1931 episode as martyrdom. He had sparked bedlam in the assembly this March by calling the martyrs “traitors”. “Communal violence was given a false narrative of martyrdom. The recent remarks by Omar, equating Islamist rioters with freedom fighters, are an insult to the nation and its true freedom struggle,” Sharma said Sunday.Deputy CM Choudhary hit back with a veiled jab at the BJP. “If they admire Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, what’s wrong in remembering the July 13 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the rights of people?” Choudhary asked as NC functionaries in Jammu paid tributes.",J&K chief minister barred from visiting graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar.

"Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha: I take full onus for Pahalgam, was a security failure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-i-take-full-onus-for-pahalgam-was-a-security-failure/articleshow/122426736.cms,"File photo: J&K LG Manoj Sinha (Picture credit: PTI)

LG Manoj Sinha, who completes five years at J&K Raj Bhavan, told TOI’s Bharti Jain that the Pahalgam terror attack was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. “The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide.

” “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”

Excerpts from the interview:

Has the Pahalgam attack shattered the myth that terrorism is on the wane in J&K?

There has been no attack in J&K since Operation Sindoor. Do you think this will hold?

Is local involvement in Pahalgam attack a worry for security agencies?

How has the Pahalgam incident impacted tourism in J&K?

What is the status on tourist destinations closed after Pahalgam attack?

What happened in Pahalgam was very unfortunate; innocent people were brutally killed. I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure. The common belief here has been that terrorists do not target tourists. The location where the attack took place is an open meadow. There is no facility or room for security forces to be present there.This was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. The arrests made by NIA in the case corroborate local involvement but it would still be wrong to conclude that the security environment in J&K stands completely vitiated. The attack was a debilitating and deliberate strike on the nation’s soul. The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide and trigger a backlash against the people of J&K living in other parts of the country, adding to the feeling of alienation.Pakistan doesn’t want J&K to be peaceful and prosperous. In the past five years, the J&K economy’s size has doubled. Tourists have been flocking in high numbers. This (attack) was a hit by Pakistan at the economic well-being of Kashmir. But condemnation and protests by the people of Kashmir following the attack provided a befitting reply to Pakistan and terror outfits. They were clear signs that terrorism is not acceptable here anymore.Operation Sindoor has drawn red lines for Pakistan. India has made it clear that any terror attack will be considered an act of war. The manner in which our forces carried out precise hits against terror facilities in Pakistan, and when it tried to target our military and civilian assets, how they destroyed their airbases, conveyed a stern message to Pakistan. Still, a country that has made terrorism its declared state policy, is not to be trusted. I am confident that the home ministry, defence ministry and our intelligence agencies are keeping a watch on Pakistan. But it is a fact that there has been no terror attack in J&K after Operation Sindoor.Local terror recruitment is at an all-time low. There has been just one incident of local recruitment this year as compared to 6 to 7 last year; there was a time when this figure used to be 150-200.

Rijiju had later clarified that he had not spoken on behalf of the Indian government.Spokesperson Yu Jing said on X the Indian government has made political commitments to China, recognising that Xizang Autonomous Region is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and that India does not allow Tibetans to engage in political activities against China in India.The controversy over the Dalai Lama's announcement that China will have no role in his reincarnation has erupted at a time both countries are engaged in efforts to normalise the relationship after a protracted military standoff.

NEW DELHI: India and Saudi Arabia witnessed the signing of long-term agreements between leading Sauidi mining company Ma'aden and Indian companies, IPL, KRIBHCO and CIL, for supply of 3.1 million MT of DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertiliser per annum for five years, with likely extension of another five years with mutual consent.The agreements were signed during Union minister for fertilisers and chemicals J P Nadda's ongoing ""landmark"" visit to Saudi Arabia.Indian officials said this represents a substantial increase in the availability of the crucial DAP fertiliser, ensuring the goal of food security in the medium to long term. China is one of the countries India has been dependent on for DAP supplies, and the govt is looking to reduce its reliance on the country for what is the most used fertiliser in India after urea.Without naming China, a source said that at a time when some countries are showing a restrictive approach in fertiliser supply, the commitment from Riyadh demonstrates that India's friends and partners continue to work closely to deliver requirements and collaborate on future investments.Indian officials said Nadda's visit provided a further impetus to the expanding strategic partnership with Saudi, following the State Visit of PM Modi to Jeddah in April.""Both sides underscored their commitment to broadening the scope of bilateral relations to include other key fertilisers such as urea along with DAP, aiming to ensure India's fertiliser security. Talks were also held on facilitating mutual investments, with a focus on exploring opportunities for Indian PSUs to invest in audi fertiliser sector, and reciprocally, Saudi investments in India,"" said an official.","India and Saudi Arabia witnessed the signing of long-term agreements between leading Sauidi mining company Ma'aden and Indian companies.

PATNA: Raju Sinha has been eagerly waiting for booth-level officers (BLOs) to deliver enumeration forms (EFs) to his residence in Patna's Patel Nagar for the past 18 days. A health worker posted in Bhojpur district, he leaves for office early every morning and, after reaching work, repeatedly calls his wife to check whether the forms have arrived.""There are 13 votes in my household, and if our names are not included in the electoral rolls, we will cease to be voters. Time is running out, and we are all quite worried,"" Sinha shared over the phone on Sunday.The last date for submitting EFs is July 25. With no option left, he finally contacted the district election officer's office, which assured him that the BLO concerned would be sent to his residence ""very soon"".Munna Singh, a cloth trader residing in Patna's Friends Colony, echoed Raju's concern: ""No BLO has visited our area in past 18 days."" The experience of Umesh Singh, a social worker, is no different. ""No BLO has come to my house in Vijay Nagar locality.

There are four electors in his family, and they have never missed an opportunity to vote.They are not alone. Scores of residents in Patna are still waiting for BLOs to visit their homes.

Election Commission (EC) claims that more than 80 per cent of the EFs have already been collected, stating that four out of every five electors have submitted their forms, even as complaints of ""missing"" BLOs persist.As per EC guidelines, BLOs are required to conduct door-to-door enumeration in three steps: first, to distribute the EFs to all existing electors; second, to guide them in filling out the forms; and third, to collect the completed EFs along with the necessary documents.Deputy election officer of Patna, Ashutosh Rai, said BLOs were actively engaged in the task and would reach every household. ""There is nothing to worry about. If they haven't reached today, they will definitely come tomorrow,"" he told TOI.However, leader of opposition in the assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, dismissed EC's claim of 80 per cent EF collection.

India in grip of silent salt consumption epidemic: ICMR-NIE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-in-grip-of-silent-salt-consumption-epidemic-icmr-nie/articleshow/122425215.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Excessive salt consumption is fuelling a silent epidemic in India with people at increased risk of hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and kidney disorders, according to scientists from ICMR's National Institute of Epidemiology.The scientists have initiated a community-led salt reduction study to address the issue and are focusing on low-sodium salt substitutes.While the World Health Organisation recommends less than 5 grams of salt per person per day, studies show that urban Indians consume around 9.2 grams/day, and even in rural areas, it is around 5.6 grams/day - both higher than recommended. One promising tool in this effort is low-sodium salt substitutes -- blends where part of the sodium chloride is replaced with potassium or magnesium salts, Dr Sharan Murali, a senior scientist at National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) and principal investigator of the study, said. ""Lesser sodium consumption helps reduce blood pressure and improves overall heart health, making low-sodium alternatives a meaningful switch, especially for those with hypertension,"" Dr Murali stated.""Just switching to low-sodium salt can lower blood pressure by 7/4 mmHg on average, a small change with a big impact,"" Dr Murali said.To tackle the issue of high salt consumption, the NIE has launched a three-year intervention project in Punjab and Telangana, supported by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of structured salt reduction counselling in reducing blood pressure and sodium intake among individuals with hypertension, senior scientist at NIE, Dr Ganesh Kumar, who is also a part of the study, said.","Excessive salt consumption is fuelling a silent epidemic in India.

Indian Coast Guard and Gujarat ATS intercept over 300kg narcotics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-ats-indian-coast-guard-seize-300kg-drugs-worth-rs-1800-crore/articleshow/120268647.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

In an overnight operation on 12-13 April 25, Indian Coast Guard undertook an intelligence based anti-narcotics operation at sea jointly with the Gujarat ATS. More than 300kg of narcotics worth approx Rs 1,800 crore has been seized.The operation was a perfect example of inter-agency coordination wherein based on a corroborated input from Gujarat ATS, an ICG ship from the Coast Guard Region (West), which was on multi-mission deployment off North Maharashtra/ South Gujarat area, diverted and intercepted an attempted transshipment in proximity of the notional International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) prior it could be undertaken, thus leading to the successful operation.Based on the credible intel of ATS, the ICG ship identified a suspect boat despite pitch dark night. On realising the approaching ICG ship, the suspect boat dumped its narcotics consignment in sea before it started fleeing towards the IMBL.The alert ICG ship deployed its sea boat immediately for recovery of the jettisoned consignment whilst commencing a hot chase of the suspect boat. The proximity of IMBL and the initial separation between the ICG ship and the boat at the time of its detection helped the perpetrator to evade interception before it crossed over the IMBL within a short time.The cross over resulted in termination of the hot chase and precluded the ICG ship to apprehend the suspect boat. Meanwhile, the ICG team in sea-boat, after thorough search in the tough night conditions, recovered the sizeable amount narcotics that was dumped into sea.The seized narcotics has been brought to Porbandar by the ICG ship for further investigations. The jointness of ICG and ATS, which has led to 13 such successful law enforcement operations in recent years reaffirms the synergy for national objective.","Indian Coast Guard undertook an intelligence based anti-narcotics operation at sea jointly with the Gujarat ATS.

Power of Rs 10: Firms bet big on small packs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-of-rs-10-firms-bet-big-on-small-packs/articleshow/120268450.cms,"MUMBAI: This summer, consumer goods companies are turning up the heat on Rs 10 price packs-brands are pushing new products and variants within the price range into the market and also sharpening focus on distribution and marketing of smaller packs. Rasna for instance, has launched a fruit drink concentrate in Rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage. The company's chairman Piruz Khambatta told TOI it will allow the lower middle-class an affordable alternative to other brands selling similar products at higher prices. Mother Dairy has widened its bouquet of Rs 10 packs by adding mango lassi and pudina chaach to the mix while PepsiCo has introduced a no-sugar beverage pack in Hyderabad at that price.While Rs 10 packs have always been key to companies' pricing strategy for India as it enables them to get more consumers within their fold in the value conscious market, the renewed bets on smaller packs also comes at a time when hit by high inflation over the past few quarters, middle class households have curtailed discretionary spending. Given that summers this time set in early in many parts of the country and projections indicating a scorching season ahead, companies want to tap into this opportunity to spur demand and the ploy here is pricing.""In terms of consumption, the environment remains mixed. Companies are trying to push smaller packs and drive more frequency. Also, after the launch of Campa, Rs 10 packs will somewhat make sure that companies remain competitive,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president at Elara Capital.Dabur said that its portfolio of juices offered at Rs 10 will be a key distribution and market share driver for the company this summer. ""For beverages, the Rs 10 price point hits the sweet spot of affordability for Indian consumers, making it the preferred out-of-home consumption price point. This summer too, we will focus on offering more value for money to reduce the relative price differential with aerated beverages,"" said Monisha Prasher, marketing head, beverages at Dabur India. Mother Dairy has already seen a 30%-40% surge in demand for beverages, ice-creams and curd over last year, helped by an early onset of summer, said managing director Manish Bandlish. Rival Amul has stepped up competition in the market by launching Tru dairy-based fruit drink at Rs 10 for 150 ml.Coca-Cola's global CFO John Murphy who was on a visit to India earlier this year had said that the Rs 10 price point is very important in India and the company will focus on it. ""It's very important to understand the magic price points in a market like India and the Indian consumer is pretty elastic in what price point they are willing to buy or not,"" Murphy had said. Reliance's move to push Campa Cola in the market at a cheaper price of Rs 10 has nudged all brands to revisit their strategies.",Rasna has launched a fruit drink concentrate in Rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage.

"Indian first and Indian last: Dr Ambedkar, a visionary reformer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-first-and-indian-last-dr-ambedkar-a-visionary-reformer/articleshow/120267396.cms,"Rajnath Singh (File photo)

Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar , one of India's greatest visionaries. There have been deliberate and unjust attempts to downplay the legacy of Dr Ambedkar . After more than a century, the greatest injustice to his legacy is to reduce him to a Dalit leader. Today, he should be seen not merely as a symbol of resistance for Dalits and marginalised, which he undoubtedly is and always will be, but also as one of the foremost thinkers of modern India.It is recorded that when he was at school, he was not even permitted to drink water from the common tap that other children drank from. One day, in the scorching heat, when he decided to drink from the source closest to him, he was assaulted for daring to violate this oppressive taboo. After such an incident, many young boys would have been resigned to their fate. Others may have become reactionary, rebelling against an unjust system through violent action. But Ambedkar channelised his inner angst into a zeal for learning. He went on to get an MA, MSc, PhD, DSc, DLitt and Bar-at-Law, including degrees at Columbia and London School of Economics.Providence granted Dr Ambedkar unparalleled grit, intellect and integrity, which he put to use as a social reformer , jurist, economist, philosopher, human rights champion and nation-builder. His role as an institution builder also needs to be highlighted. Several institutions in modern India, such as RBI and Central Water Commission, find their genesis in Babasaheb's farsightedness.Being a staunch democrat, Dr Ambedkar also believed that a democratic form of govt presupposes a democratic form of society. He believed that without moral order in society, there cannot be democracy and rule of law. It can also be said that for him, democracy, politics and ethics formed a trinity just like liberty, equality and fraternity. Like his greatest interlocutor, Gandhiji, Dr Ambedkar was committed to fundamental social reform.This is because he was deeply worried about the future of India, its democracy, and hard-earned independence. His trepidations found expression in his last speech in the Constituent Assembly. Amid loud cheers, Dr Ambedkar held that we must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood. He forewarned that India would lose its democracy and independence a second time if Indians become complacent.It is his words of caution that set India on the path of a vibrant democracy for almost eight decades. However, today, we see attempts by some people to reduce the fraternity between Indians based on social cleavages such as caste, religion, ethnicity, language etc. We should be on guard to ensure that these divisive tendencies remain nothing but failed attempts. For instance, Ambedkar mocked the Aryan invasion theory at a time when he could have gained most from the Aryan-Dravidian divide. ""Whether a tribe or family was racially Aryan or Dravidian was a question which never troubled the people of India until foreign scholars came in and began to draw the line,"" Babasaheb wrote in a paper published in 1918.Furthermore, those who are attempting to use linguistic issues to further their narrow and sectarian interests would greatly benefit by reading Dr Ambedkar's views on the unity of the nation and the role of a language in this. On Sept 10, 1949, he moved an amendment in the Constituent Assembly supporting Sanskrit - one of the nine languages he had mastered - as the official language of the Union. In his 'Thoughts on Linguistic States', he also declared it the ""bounden duty of all Indians to own up Hindi as their language"". Dr Ambedkar believed that social and economic democracy goes hand in hand with political democracy. PM Narendra Modi ji has set a target of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, which conforms to the vision of Babasaheb.Last month, when PM Modi visited Deekshabhoomi, he reaffirmed govt's commitment to work even harder to realise the India which Babasaheb envisioned. Babasaheb's birth anniversary presents all Indians with an opportunity to renew our pledge to the values and ideals given by him. Let us rise above our race, religion, region, caste and creed, and be 'Indian'.The writer is India's Raksha Mantri","Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar, one of India's greatest visionaries.

JEE Mains 2025: What is the difference between mark and percentile?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/jee-mains-2025-what-is-the-difference-between-mark-and-percentile/articleshow/120247839.cms,"Understanding the difference: JEE Main Marks vs Percentile

Marks: This refers to the total score obtained by a candidate out of 300. Each correct answer adds to the score, while incorrect responses can attract negative marking.



Percentile: This is a comparative metric. It reflects the percentage of candidates who scored lower than a particular student. Unlike marks, percentiles do not denote absolute performance but rather relative performance.

How the JEE Main rank is calculated in 2025

Percentile Score

Key factors affecting JEE Main 2025 marks vs percentile vs rank

Total number of candidates: A greater number of test-takers increases the competition. With more candidates, minor differences in marks can significantly affect percentile and rank.



Difficulty level of the exam: If a particular session is tougher than others, scoring lower marks may still translate to a high percentile. The normalisation process adjusts percentile scores accordingly.



Normalisation across sessions: To maintain equity, NTA compares performance across different exam shifts. This adjustment ensures that no candidate is disadvantaged due to the relative toughness of their session.



Individual performance: Ultimately, your personal performance is pivotal. The higher your score, the higher your percentile is likely to be—assuming all other variables remain constant.



Maximum marks: JEE Main continues to be out of 300 marks. Understanding how these marks scale to percentiles and rank gives candidates clarity on their performance spectrum.



Aspiring engineering students across India take the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main to secure seats in top-tier institutions like the NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs. However, many remain puzzled by the terms marks, percentile, and rank, which are crucial to understanding their standing in the examination. This article delves deep into the difference between JEE Main marks and percentile, explains how ranks are calculated, and outlines the factors that influence these metrics in 2025.At the heart of the confusion lies the distinction between raw marks and percentile scores. Here's a breakdown:For instance, if a student scores a 98 percentile, it means they have performed better than 98% of the candidates who appeared for the same session.The rank in JEE Main 2025 is derived from the percentile score, not directly from the marks. Since the exam is conducted in multiple sessions, the normalisation process is employed to ensure fairness. This process adjusts for variations in difficulty across sessions, making percentile scores the most equitable metric for comparison.The formula used for calculating percentile is:= (Number of candidates who scored less than you / Total number of candidates) × 100A higher percentile ensures a better All India Rank (AIR), which in turn influences college admissions.Several variables come into play when mapping your raw score to your percentile and final rank:","JEE Main marks are the total score obtained by a candidate out of 300 marks.

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies.""""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare.

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.Acknowledging the long timelines typically associated with developing cutting-edge fighter jet programs, Kamat said, ""If you look at any programme anywhere in the world, it takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new platform. So we have started this journey only in 2024, when the CCS sanctioned the project. So it will take ten years and we have committed to deliver the platform by 2035…""""We want to start an AERO engine programme and we want to collaborate with a foreign OEM to cut down the risks of development. AERO engine technology is a very complex technology, however we have learnt a lot from Kaveri. Kaveri was a fourth generation engine and the current engine technology has moved to sixth generation, so we want to work with foreign OEM to reduce the risks as well as cut down the time for development. Hopefully, we will have some good news on this in the next few months..,"" he added.Talking about other crucial projects that are set to be completed in year, Kamat said, ""There are many projects which are now moving towards maturity. In the next six months to one year, you will see many of our systems getting inducted. VSHORAD, MPATGM, we have LCA Mark II, which will have its first flight, so there are many systems which are now moving towards maturity and in the next six months to one year you will see many of them getting inducted.""The comments came after the defence organisation, for the first time, demonstrated its ability to neutralize fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies...,"" Kamat said.With this breakthrough, India has joined a select group of nations—such as the US, China, and Russia—that have successfully showcased similar advanced directed-energy capabilities.","India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.

Governor Ravi had withheld the bills, reserving them for the President's consideration.

Poll How do you feel about the impact of social media on public perception during crises? It's just noise, doesn't matter much. It greatly influences public opinion.

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Sunday lashed out at cricketer-turned-Trinamool Congress MP Yusuf Pathan , amid ongoing violence in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district. Referring to a post on Pathan’s Instagram — where he appears relaxed and sipping tea—Poonawalla questioned the MP’s priorities as the state grapples with unrest.However, Murshidabad—the epicentre of the violence, is represented by Pathan's party colleague, Abu Taher Khan in Lok Sabha, Poonawalla still used the situation to target him and TMC over his social media post. BJP's Poonawalla also used pictures of violence-hit areas in his X post.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Bengal is burning. HC has said it can’t keep eyes closed and deployed central forces. Mamata Banerjee is encouraging such state-protected violence as police stay silent! Meanwhile, Yusuf Pathan—MP—sips tea and soaks in the moment as Hindus get slaughtered… This is TMC.""Later, speaking to ANI news agency, Poonawalla further intensified his criticism: ""Mamata Banerjee has picked up a cricketer named Yusuf Pathan from somewhere and gave him a ticket. The vote bank made him win in Baharampur and today when Bengal is burning, Hindus are being selectively killed, Yusuf Pathan is enjoying sipping tea… This is the priority of TMC.""His remarks came amid heightened tensions in parts of West Bengal, especially in Murshidabad, which has seen violent protests following changes to the Waqf law.At least three people have died and over 150 have been arrested. Several areas, including Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Murshidabad, witnessed arson, stone-pelting, and clashes with security forces.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.Authorities have since conducted multiple raids and deployed additional forces to restore order.","BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at cricketer-turned-Trinamool Congress MP Yusuf Pathan.

Poll Should the Indian government pursue stricter laws against individuals involved in terror activities? No, current laws are sufficient Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in its ongoing probe into Tahawwur Rana's involvement in the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, is focusing on the network of people who helped plan the conspiracy.Rana was questioned for the second day in a row as investigators try to understand how the large-scale attack was planned and who all were involved. NIA is also directing its effort to examine the possible links of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.As sources informed PTI news agency, the NIA is dissecting dozens of phone calls between Rana and Headley, using them to piece together the larger conspiracy that spanned continents. Investigators believe these conversations hold vital clues to the operational details of the attacks, and to those who worked behind the scenes.One of the leads includes a person based in Dubai, believed to have met Rana on Headley’s request. Investigators think this man knew about the attack plans. They are also checking if this ""mystery man"" was connected to Dawood Ibrahim or his criminal network known as D-Company, which is based in Dubai, as sources told IANS news agency.The agency is also looking into Rana’s possible ties with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which carried out the attacks. NIA officials believe the planning for the 26/11 attacks may have started as early as 2005.To support their investigation, Rana’s fresh voice samples have been sent for testing to match with calls made right after the attack. Investigators also suspect that Rana may have visited several parts of India before the attack, possibly to assist in planning.Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening. A Delhi court gave the NIA 18 days of custody to question him. He is currently being held at the NIA headquarters in Delhi in a high-security cell.According to the NIA, Rana is being questioned not just for his role in the Mumbai attacks, but also to see if he was involved in planning similar terror attacks in other Indian cities. He faces several serious charges, including conspiracy, murder, and helping terrorists.The 2008 Mumbai attacks were among the deadliest in India’s history. Ten terrorists came to Mumbai by boat and attacked several places including the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, CST railway station, and Nariman House. The attacks lasted three days, killing 166 people and injuring over 230.With Rana now in India, the NIA is hoping to get a clearer picture of how the entire plot was put together and who all were involved behind the scenes.","Tahawwur Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening.

Investigation underway

NEW DELHI: The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in Karnataka's Hubballi, was killed in an encounter on Sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.Earlier in the day, a body of a girl was discovered in a tin-roofed abandoned shed, sparking outrage. Hundreds gathered outside the Ashok Nagar police station demanding justice for the child.A massive manhunt was launched and the accused was identified as 35-year-old Ritesh Kumar from Bihar's Patna.Later in the day, based on CCTV footage and inputs from local residents, police traced the accused.“This morning in Vijayanagara area, within Ashok Nagar limits, the girl’s body was found in an abandoned shed. We identified the accused as Ritesh Kumar. He tried to flee, damaged the police vehicle, assaulted our officers, and pelted stones,” said Commissioner Kumar.“In self-defence, PSI Annapurna fired warning shots and then shot at the accused, injuring him in the leg and chest,” he added. The man was later declared dead.Defending police action, Karnataka government chief whip Saleem Ahmed said, “The commissioner has given me the information that the accused tried to hit the lady inspector and in self-defence, she had to fire at him... It is not a failure of law and order. Our police are competent enough to take action, so have they…”According to Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner N Shashi Kumar, the girl’s mother had taken her along while working in nearby homes in the locality. An unidentified man took the girl away from one of these houses. After a frantic search, she was found unconscious in a bathroom inside a tin-roofed abandoned shed located directly opposite the house where she was last seen.“She was immediately shifted to the hospital where she was declared brought dead,” the Commissioner said.The victim’s family hails from Koppal district. Her mother works as a domestic help and beauty parlour assistant, while the father is a painter, officials said.While reports of sexual assault have emerged, the police have not confirmed it. “No information for now. Cause of death and whether there was any kind of assault will all be verified after medical examination,” Kumar said.Following the gruesome incident, angry residents gathered in large numbers at the Ashok Nagar police station demanding swift justice and answers. Police appealed to the public to maintain calm and let the investigation proceed.“The complaint is being taken from the girl’s parents. Necessary legal action is underway,” Kumar said.Authorities are still verifying key details. A post-mortem is expected to shed light on the cause of death and whether there was any sexual assault involved.The identity and background of the accused are also being investigated. “Once the identity is fully established, we’ll ascertain his whereabouts and any past records,” Kumar said.","The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in Karnataka's Hubballi, was killed in an encounter on Sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.

'A truly pathetic state of affairs'

Home secretary assures all assistance

NEW DELHI: Amid unrest in West Bengal's Murshidabad , 12 more people were arrested in connection with violence, taking the total number to over 150. No new incident of violence has been reported yet after five companies of BSF were deployed in the Muslim-dominated district. Meanwhile, BJP claimed that over 400 Hindus have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the tension.The move came after Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the ""immediate"" deployment of Central forces in the area. IG South Bengal Frontier Karni Singh Shekhawat, said that BSF would coordinate with state police to restore peace in the region. He added that more forces would be added if needed.""We have to work along with them in this situation. The discussions were held on this only. We have sent our five companies to help the police. We are here to help the police, not for independent action. We will act according to the demands of the state police. We hope that peace will be restored here soon. If the police need more companies, we will provide them. BSF is ready for all situations,"" he said.The violence in West Bengal's Muslim-dominated Murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended Waqf law. At least 3 people were killed and over 150 were arrested in connection with the violence. Meanwhile, raids were conducted at several places in West Bengal.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.BJP leader and West Bengal Assembly's Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari claimed that over 400 people have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the violence.Further attacking Bengal's government, he said that ""appeasement politics"" on TMC has ""emboldened radical elements.""""More than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad driven by fear of religiously driven bigots were forced to flee across the river & take shelter at Par Lalpur High School, Deonapur-Sovapur GP, Baisnabnagar, Malda,"" Adhikari wrote in a post on X.The BJP leader also shared pictures and videos from the area, including interviews from displaced individuals. One man claimed his house had been set on fire while alleging that police personnel present at the scene failed to act and instead fled.""I urge the Central Paramilitary Forces deployed in the District, the State Police and the district administration to ensure the safe return of these displaced Hindus & protect their lives from this jihadist terror. Bengal is burning. The social fabric is torn. Enough is enough,"" his post read.""Religious persecution in Bengal is real. Appeasement politics of TMC has emboldened radical elements. Hindus are being hunted, our people are running for their lives in their own land! Shame on the State Govt for allowing this breakdown of law & order,"" he added.Adding to the rising dissent, Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday announced a public protest meeting against the Act.“A protest public meeting is being organized by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board against the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 on 19th April from 7 pm to 10 pm in Hyderabad Darussalam. It will be presided over by the President of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Khalid Saifullah Rahmani,” Owaisi said at a press conference.Owaisi said members from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh’s Muslim Personal Law Boards and key Muslim organizations would participate.“They will tell the public through their speeches that this Waqf (Amendment) Act is not in favour of the Waqf... We are also trying to talk to the members of the Waqf Committee, and if their schedule permits, they can also come and participate.”A senior police officer said on Sunday that prohibitory orders under section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) have been imposed in affected areas.He added that internet services were also suspended and security forces are checking vehicles on the main roads and patrolling the sensitive pockets.Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Saugata Roy said that chief minster Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community.Saugata Roy said, ""Mamata Banerjee is the leader of the people of Bengal. She knows how to run Bengal. There is no place for BJP here. People are unhappy over Waqf Amendment Bill, so the Chief Minister has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community. People's sentiments are agitated over the Waqf Bill. The reaction was spontaneous.""BJP Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal, Jyotirmay Singh Mahato on Sunday wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting him to declare select border districts of West Bengal as 'disturbed areas' under AFSPA.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind chief Mahmood Madani launched a scathing attack on the legislation, calling it a “politically motivated” move to enable land grabbing in the name of reform.Addressing a press conference in the national capital on Sunday, Madani alleged that the Act was not intended to strengthen the Waqf Boards, but to serve “vested interests.”“This is not an issue of Waqf but politics. In the name of Muslims, sometimes by abusing Muslims or by being the sympathisers of Muslims, this act (was implemented) with malicious intent,” Madani said.Madani claimed the government and its allies had created a false narrative to justify the amendment, portraying the previous Waqf Boards as operating without accountability.“BJP and its friends in the country and media friends told that the earlier Waqf Board was such that it could do anything... People of their choice were made in the government,” he said.He went on to accuse the government of facilitating real estate developers and land occupiers, particularly those eyeing prime properties.“You are trying to help the builders and land occupiers, so that they get the lands in prime locations... This act or amendment is not right for the country, society or Muslims. You are benefiting the occupiers,” Madani said.Amid tension, political storm erupted after BJP lashed out at state's chief minister Mamata Banerjee, saying that her government is ""incapable"" of handling the situation.""Let it be known that this was not an act of protest, rather a premeditated act of violence, an assault on Democracy and Governance by Jihadist forces who seek to spread chaos in order to assert their dominance and sow fear amongst other Communities of our Society,"" BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari said in a post on X.""Public property was destroyed, Government Officials felt threatened, and an atmosphere of fear and intimidation was created, all under the false guise of dissent. The silence of the Mamata Banerjee Government is deafening,"" he added.'A truly pathetic state of affairs'West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar alleged that Mamata has handed over the state to ""Jihadis"" for vote bank politics.""The situation is very terrible. The special bench of the High Court has given the verdict, and we welcome it. The situation has become like this because of Mamata Banerjee's incompetence. The verdict of the High Court today is a big slap on Mamata Banerjee's cheek that she is not ready to rule the state. She is not eligible to rule the state,"" he said while speaking to ANI.On Sunday, BJP's Amit Malviya targetted Banerjee, saying that the morale of the West Bengal police has hit a new low, with senior officials struggling to maintain order amid a series of violent incidents and growing political pressure. In a post on X, Malviya claimed that during the recent violence in Murshidabad, West Bengal police officers refused to enter the riot-hit areas until the BSF arrived. He further alleged that the director general of police had to be physically present to coax officers into action.""The morale of the West Bengal Police is at an all-time low, following Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s repeated capitulation to rampaging Islamist mobs. In fact, they even refused to enter the riot-affected areas of Murshidabad until the BSF arrived. The Director General of Police had to be physically present to coax his own force into action. A similar situation occurred during the Sandeshkhali unrest, where the state’s top cop had to intervene personally—though the reasons were different then,"" Malviya said.""During the RG Kar protests, it was police officers who held press conferences and planted stories to shape the narrative. Every time Mamata Banerjee finds herself cornered, she uses the police as a political shield, as if no other TMC leader is willing—or perhaps even allowed—to defend her. The rest appear to be nothing more than clerks in Mamata Banerjee’s criminal empire,"" he added.Union home secretary Govind Mohan on Saturday assured all possible help amid violence in a video conference with the chief secretary and the director general of police of the state.Mohan asked the high officials to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also and take adequate steps.He mentioned that the ""Centre is also closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary.""",The violence in West Bengal's Muslim-dominated Murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended Waqf law.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

GURGAON: A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat - featuring a girl emerging out of a suitcase like a magician's escape - went viral on social media, with many describing it as a boy's 'Romeo-and-Juliet' style attempt to smuggle his love into his hostel. The university said it was prank gone too far and was taking action against the students.Although the video - which surfaced Saturday - does not show any boy in it, sources at the university said one had indeed sneaked into the girls' hostel.It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the suitcase incident.According to Anjoo Mohun, director of communications at the university, the video shows a group of girl students moving their friend around the hostel in a large suitcase as part of a ""light-hearted"" joke.""This was a prank, entirely confined to the premises of the girls' hostel.

NEW DELHI: Amid rising political heat over the Murshidabad violence in West Bengal, RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha hit out at the BJP for repeatedly invoking Hindu victimhood, saying the narrative had worn thin and that social harmony was a shared responsibility of both the Centre and the states.“Kitni jagah ye card kheloge, ghis chuka hai,” said Jha, responding to BJP allegations of ""state-sponsored, state-protected, and state-encouraged targeted violence against Hindus."" The BJP had blamed the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government for the clashes during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Speaking to ANI, Jha added, “The time has come for PM Modi to break his silence. The country's social harmony is the responsibility of the Centre and all state governments... because if the country remains, only then there will be elections and parties would win and lose them.”The violence in Murshidabad has left three people dead and led to the arrest of 150 individuals.

The SOP aims at preventing a large number of road crashes and fatalities due to wrong-side and distracted driving.The SOP was prepared following an SC order directing 23 states and 7 UTs to file compliance reports indicating the implementation of electronic monitoring as provided in central Motor Vehicles Act. The automated camera enforcement system of traffic rules is the default mode for electronic enforcement and generating prosecutable evidence, focusing on accountability of violators and enforcement agencies.As per the submitted SOP, the cameras installed should automatically generate evidence of distracted drivers, particularly of those using mobile phones, eating or drinking and not wearing seatbelt. The cameras should capture an offence, including a one second to 10 seconds video having vehicle, location, time and date details, without motion blur. The system needs to process violations within ""one"" second and generate real-time alerts for enforcement authorities.In case of driving against the flow of traffic, the system will need to use cameras, sensors and advanced algorithms to detect the violation automatically. It should be able to differentiate between actual violations and permitted movements, such as those of police, ambulance, fire brigade. It must capture high-resolution images of the violating vehicle and a five-second video before and after detection of violation.Similarly, to rein in vehicle owners and drivers who change phone numbers and addresses to evade paying fines, the ministry will have a one-time three-month window to verify and update the details, and after that it will be a prerequisite for availing any transport and driving licence-related services.

The report was submitted to the cabinet on Friday. On Sunday, all cabinet ministers were delivered a copy to study and prepare for the April 17 meeting.Though the leaked report does not give the respective proportions in total population of the two dominant caste groups in Karnataka - Vokkaligas and Lingayats - it does propose quotas in different categories which the two rival caste groups are part of.The report says that under category III(A), which includes Vokkaligas and two other dominant communities, the population is placed at 73 lakh with a recommendation of a 7% reservation. Similarly, the population under category III (B), which comprises Veerashaiva-Lingayats and five other communities, is 81.3 lakh and the report recommends 8% quota. The total population of the state is pegged at 5.9 crore.As per the report's recommendations, the total reservation for all communities would increase to 73.5% (including 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs) from the existing 50%, in line with SC capping guideline.Though the exact proportion of Lingayats and Vokkaligas in the population of modern-day Karnataka is not known, the two communities were estimated at 19% and 17%, respectively, on the basis of which the Chenappa Reddy commission for socio-economic survey had given its report in 1990. Based on that report, the then Deve Gowda govt in the state had recommended 4% reservations for Muslims.Even though the total Lingayat numbers are not known, industries minister and Lingayat politician M B Patil hinted at mismatch between ground realities and the survey findings, saying: ""It is nobody's fault that Lingayat numbers have fallen. Members of some Lingayat sub-castes have (in a fine slicing of sub-caste identity) declared themselves as Hindu Ganiga, Hindu Banajiga and Hindu Sadaras for the sake of (existing) 2A reservation benefits. If we take all of them into account and also Lingayats recorded under 3B, then their population crosses 1 crore. The cabinet meeting will discuss all these finer points.""Muslims are placed at 12.6% of the population in the survey conducted in 2015.The largest community in Karnataka, however, are the Scheduled Castes with a population of nearly 1.1 crore and 108 sub-castes within them.Responding to senior Congressman Shamanur Shivashankarappa's claim that the report was ""unscientific"", deputy CM D K Shivakumar was cryptic in his response: ""Everyone is trying to safeguard their communities. I will not stop them (as it's their democratic right to do so). On April 17, the cabinet will discuss the issue.""BJP targeted Congress govt for minority appeasement.

Kernel of calm for Goa's cashew business as Trump hits 90-day pause on higher tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kernel-of-calm-for-goas-cashew-business-as-trump-hits-90-day-pause-on-higher-tariffs/articleshow/120266725.cms,"PANAJI: US President Donald Trump's decision to hit pause on his trade war - except with China - has alleviated anxieties in the far corners of North Goa. While Trump's tariff tantrums did not result in any additional duties on Indian cashew nuts, his move to impose higher tariffs on Vietnam, which holds more than 80% market share of cashews in the US, would have seen nuts from Vietnam and African nations flooding India.Owners of cashew nut processing plants said that such an eventuality would have sent prices tumbling in Goa. Vietnam, which has the lion's share as a supplier of cashews - raw and processed - in the US market, was hit with a steep 46% tariff by Trump before the 90-day pause was announced.Vietnam imports raw cashews from West African nations and then exports them to the US. If the demand from the US and Vietnam had dropped, cashew nuts from West Africa would have swamped India, crashing cashew prices. ""If Vietnam is affected, it will default on the African crop and the price will drop. This is our worry,"" Goa Cashew Manufacturers Association president Rohit Zantye said. Vietnam imports raw cashew nuts from Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Benin, Tonga, and Ghana. Goan companies also tap those markets. Many Goan cashew nut processing factories and packers have already placed import orders for the current year.As of now, the landed cost for African cashew nuts is Rs 155 per kg while for Goa cashew nuts, which are of a higher quality, it is Rs 175 per kg. ""We have already purchased 40% of our raw material. If the raw cashew prices collapse after we have purchased at a higher price, it would have been a challenge,"" Zantye said. ""Those who have bought local produce will be in the soup since the African cashew nuts will flood the Indian market,"" he added.The reciprocal tariffs imposed by Trump roiled the international markets last week and an impact analysis by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) had said tariffs could be an opportunity for the cashew nut processing units. ""Vietnam is the dominant supplier of cashews (raw as well as processed) in the US market with more than 80% share,"" the Ficci report said. ""Since the reciprocal tariff imposed on Vietnam is considerably high at 46%, this gives an opportunity to other exporting countries like India to expand their market share in the US.""India currently has a 0.9% share in the export of fresh or dried cashew nuts to the US, the same as Nigeria, while Vietnam has an 88% share. Trump's reciprocal tariff on India is just 26%. In terms of preserved cashew nuts, India has a 6% share in exports to the US. However, the 15-odd cashew nut processing units in North Goa were worried last week.

30kW DEW Targets Drones & Missiles at 3.5 km,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-laser-system-to-destroy-aerial-targets/articleshow/120266057.cms,"NEW Delhi: India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors, joining a select group of countries like the US, Russia, China, UK and Israel in the quest for effective Star Wars-like directed energy weapons (DEWs).The multiple tests of the Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) to destroy a small fixed-wing aircraft and a swarm of seven drones as well as “blind” surveillance cameras and sensors mounted on drones and deployed on the ground, at ranges up to 3.5-km, were conducted at the national open air range at Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.“It is a very powerful and reusable weapon for 'beam kills’, instead of ‘kinetic kills’ with expensive missiles and ammunition. With low cost per kill, it’s much more economical, especially for extended wars like we are now seeing. This is the technology of the future,” DRDO director-general (electronics and communication systems) Dr B K Das told TOI.The 30-kilowatt vehicle-based integrated drone detection and interdiction system (IDD&IS) marks a significant breakthrough for India, which has lagged far behind other countries in developing such cost-effective counter-drone systems.The challenge will be to miniaturise the system for deployment on airborne platforms and warships as well. The armed forces have so far inducted 23 IDD&IS systems, with 2-kilowatt lasers, for around Rs 400 crore, with DRDO also completing the development of 10-kilowatt lasers. But their kill ranges are just about 1 to 2-km, as reported by TOI earlier.“The Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) was tested for a 3.5-km range in hot weather or extreme conditions on Sunday. User trials can take place in 1-1.5 years, with technology being transferred by DRDO to companies for production,” Dr Das said.With the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems and the fast emergence of deadly drone swarms as asymmetric threats, DRDO is now also working on DEWs with power levels of 50 to 100-kilowatt as well as high-energy microwaves, as per a roadmap laid down with short, medium and long-term goals.“Cost-effective defence solutions to tackle low-cost drone attacks is driving the adoption of DEWs by militaries worldwide. The cost of firing a DEW for a few seconds is equivalent to the cost of a couple of litres of petrol. Therefore, it has the potential to be a long-term and low-cost alternative to defeat a variety of targets,” another DRDO official said.Some countries are far ahead in this arena. The US, for instance, has already deployed Helios’ (high energy laser with integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance), with a 60-kilowatt laser that can be scaled up to 120-kilowatt, on some of its frontline warships to intercept armed drones, missiles and fast-attack craft.Israel, in turn, is getting set to deploy a 100-kilowatt Iron Beam’ laser weapon system with a 10-km range, while the UK is developing Dragon Fire’ for its warships.While firing focussed beams of concentrated electromagnetic energy at the speed of light at targets may be much cheaper than conventional kinetic weapons, DEWs are still to enter large-scale operational use.The kill ranges of DEWs are still far less than conventional weapons, and bad weather can adversely impact their performance. “Advancements in technology will lead to more powerful and versatile weapons. One such advancement is the development of more powerful and efficient lasers, allowing for greater range and precision. Additionally, advancements in beam-steering technology and adaptive optics may enhance the DEW’s ability to maintain focus and accuracy at longer ranges,” a DRDO scientist said.","India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely- piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors.

Despite resistance from their respective families, the couple married last year. The girl's mother filed a police complaint against the man, resulting in his arrest under Pocso Act & imprisonment.The girl, who had become pregnant, was forced by the mother to undergo an abortion. The man was released on bail a month ago. On April 4, the girl tried to call him over phone. In a fit of rage, the mother forced her daughter onto her lap, pressed her nose and mouth shut with her hands, causing her death by asphyxiation. Within hours of the murder, the mother cremated the body along the banks of Swarnamukhi river.The hasty cremation raised suspicion, and on April 9, the village revenue officer lodged a police complaint. As police probe began, the mother fled from her house. But on Friday she surrendered before a village elder confessing that she acted out of a combination of rage, fear, and social pressure.","The girl was in a relationship with a 20-year-old man for over three years.

"Proposals to bring relief from toll charge on NHs, e-expressways under finance minister’s consideration",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/proposals-to-bring-relief-from-toll-charge-on-nhs-e-expressways-under-finance-ministers-consideration/articleshow/120262135.cms,"NEW DELHI: The two proposals of road transport ministry to bring relief to lakhs of commuters from shelling out high toll on national highways and expressways — no user fee on narrower NHs that are two-and-half lanes and option of annual pass costing around Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel for cars — are now under the finance ministry’s consideration.Sources said the proposals have been approved by the road transport ministry and sent to the expenditure department of the finance ministry since it involves some revenue loss. While annual passes would cause some loss to toll revenue, stopping user fee collection on narrower highways won’t have any impact, they added.Though earlier road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had spoken about the plan to offer the option of annual and lifetime pass for private vehicles, the ministry zeroed down on the monthly pass, considering high probability of its acceptance among vehicle owners. The minister has been making statements of extending some “big relief” for highway commuters in the near future and has also claimed that with this they won’t have any complaints.Sources said the proposal of no tolls on two-and-half lanes or two-lane with paved shoulders was mooted by the minister as a review meeting and had asked officials to look into this. The user fee on such roads is 64% less than the toll payable on highways that are four-lane and more. TOI has learnt that there are less than 50 toll plazas on such stretches and barring a few all are public funded roads, meaning the toll is collected by govt’s own agencies.“In most cases, the toll generated is less than the expenses incurred. So, it isn’t a bad proposition to do away with tolling on these stretches. The only issue is highways with four lanes and more, and expressways. There are a significant number of private players collecting toll and govt has to compensate for the loss they may incur due to annual passes,” said a source.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 61,000 crore of 2024-25, private cars had a share of around 20-21%. and the large chunk of 79-80% fee comes from commercial and heavy vehicles.","No user fee on narrower NHs that are two-and-half lanes.

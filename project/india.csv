The History of India (V) c. 1550-1605

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath 's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday.During his address at the event, Jaishankar described Tipu Sultan as a ""very complex figure in history."" ""Tipu Sultan is actually a very, very complex figure in history. On the one hand, he has the reputation as a key figure who resisted the British colonial control over India, and it is a fact that his defeat and death can be considered a turning point when it came to the fate of peninsular India,"" Jaishankar said.He also pointed out that in Tipu Sultan’s case, a ""particular narrative"" has been promoted over the years, which has largely focused on his anti-British stance while downplaying other dimensions of his rule.""History in all society is complicated, and the politics of the day often indulges in cherry-picking facts. To a considerable extent that has happened in the case of Tipu Sultan,"" he remarked. According to Jaishankar, this narrative focuses on the ""Tipu-English binary"" while excluding a broader and more nuanced understanding of his role in history.The EAM noted that the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures like Tipu Sultan to emerge. He said, ""In the last decade, the changes in our political dispensation have encouraged the emergence of alternative perspectives and balanced accounts. We are no longer prisoners of a vote bank, nor is it politically incorrect to bring out inconvenient truths. There are many more subjects on which the same degree of objectivity is needed.""Jaishankar discussed the importance of studying history with an open mind and engaging in genuine debates. He emphasized that a pluralistic society and vibrant democracy require objective accounts of history. He suggested that much of India’s past has been edited to suit specific political or ideological purposes. ""How much of our past has been airbrushed, how awkward issues have been glossed over, how facts are tailored for regime convenience—these are basic questions which confront us all today,"" he said.Referring to Tipu Sultan’s actions in different regions, Jaishankar noted that opinions about him remain divided. While many remember him for resisting British colonial control, others have strong negative sentiments about his rule, particularly in regions like Mysore, Coorg, and Malabar.He acknowledged that Tipu Sultan’s resistance to the British was significant, saying, ""There can be no doubt that Tipu Sultan was fiercely and almost consistently anti-British. But how much of it was inherent and how much a result of their allying with his local rivals, that is difficult to distinguish.""The minister also highlighted Tipu Sultan’s alliances with foreign powers, which complicate a straightforward interpretation of his legacy. ""To counter British ambitions, Tipu Sultan had no hesitation in collaborating with the French and that makes a ‘straightforward anti-foreign narrative’ very difficult to assert,"" he said.Touching upon Tipu Sultan’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said Tipu reached out to the rulers of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia for support, often on the basis of shared religious ties. He noted that this reflects the historical context of the time, where the modern sense of nationhood was absent. ""Perhaps the truth is that the sense of nationhood, all of us have now, was simply not there then,"" he observed.Jaishankar praised Vikram Sampath’s book for providing a detailed and ""balanced"" account of Tipu Sultan’s life and the era he lived in. He said the book goes beyond being a simple biography, offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology, and diplomacy. ""To call Sampath's book a biography would be a serious understatement. It is something very much more, capturing the flavour of a fast-moving and complicated era but offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology and even diplomacy,"" he said.He also appreciated the challenges Sampath might have faced in presenting a more comprehensive view of Tipu Sultan, given the strong existing narratives. He emphasized that the book allows readers to make their own judgments by presenting a detailed context.Jaishankar concluded by reiterating the importance of objective historical accounts. He shared his perspective as someone who has experienced what he calls politically influenced historical narratives during his education. ""As a product myself of an institution that was at the centre of these politically driven endeavours, I could well appreciate the need to present an actual representation of history,"" he said.Jaishankar spoke about selective narratives at a time when, as part of the syllabus ""rationalization"" process, NCERT last year removed significant portions of Mughal history from its textbooks for Classes 7-12. As a result, Mughal history is now briefly covered in Class 7, touched upon in Class 8, omitted entirely in Classes 9 to 11, and included in a shortened form in Class 12.This reduction is not limited to school education. At the undergraduate level, Delhi University’s BA History Honours program has also revised its curriculum to exclude references to the Mughals. In the 2019-20 academic year, the syllabus for Semester 4 dropped the topic The Consolidation of Mughal Rule under Akbar from the course. This topic had previously covered Akbar’s military campaigns, administrative reforms, and responses to revolts and resistance."," External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday. During his address at the event, Jaisankar described Tipuultan as a ""very complex figure in history"" He said the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115858304,imgsize-796892,width-400,resizemode-4/115858304.jpg"

"In top 'clean' cities, air is not so fresh, data shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-top-clean-cities-air-is-not-so-fresh-data-shows/articleshow/115855837.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indore may be the cleanest city in India, having secured the top rank seven times in a row, but when it comes to air quality, it reported a 21% rise in the level of the pollutant PM10 in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18. The city joined 30 others including Navi Mumbai, Vizag, Cuttack, Guwahati, Gwalior, Patna, Raipur, Chandigarh and Bhopal that reported increase in the level of annual average particulate matter (PM10) - a critical air pollutant - during that period.All these 31 cities are in the list of 130 which are under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by environment ministry in Jan 2019 with an aim to improve air quality by reducing PM10 up to 40% by 2025-26 from the 2017-18 level or achieving the national standards during the period.Incidentally, Navi Mumbai was the third ranker and Vizag fourth in the list of cleanest cities after Indore and Surat in 2023. This ranking is based on the cities performance in terms of their performance in sanitation and municipal waste management. On the air quality front, Vizag reported 58% increase (second worst in the list of 31) in level of PM10 in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18 while Navi Mumbai reported 11% increase during the period.Surat, on the other hand, reported 21% reduction in the level of air pollutant in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18 but the city's PM10 continues to be much higher than the acceptable limit of 60 g/m3. Though both kinds of cleanliness - sanitation/waste and air - cannot be compared due to the very different nature of the problem, it shows that the efforts on one front may not make cities liveable unless air quality is also be taken care of by dealing with multiple other factors in neighbouring areas or in a region.On a positive note, the comparative data on level of pollutant shared by environment ministry in the Parliament, shows 97 out of 130 cities have shown improvement in air quality in terms of annual average PM10 concentrations in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18.Though 55 cities have achieved reduction of 20% or more during the period, most of them still reported higher level of pollutant than the acceptable standards. Varanasi turned out to be the best performer by reducing level of PM10 by 68%highest percentage reduction in the list of 97 - but the city still has higher level of pollutant than national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).Total 18 out of 130 cities conform to the national ambient air quality standards in terms of PM10 during 2023-24. Among big cities, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Delhi, Nagpur, Chennai and Surat are among others which have shown improvement but their pollutant levels are still not good enough to meet the annual average acceptable limit.","Indore reported a 21% rise in the level of the pollutant PM10 in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18.

Bangladesh carriers cancel 3 daily flights as flyer count nosedives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-carriers-cancel-3-daily-flights-as-flyer-count-nosedives/articleshow/115854778.cms,"No. of B'desh-Kol flights down by half since July

KOLKATA: At least two daily flights between Kolkata and Dhaka and one between Kolkata and Chittagong have been cancelled by airlines operating between the two countries as passenger count continues to nosedive in the wake of continued unrest in Bangladesh, attacks on minorities and curbs on travel due to Indian visa restrictions.Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day. The country's private carrier, US-Bangla Airlines, has reduced the frequency to Dhaka from twice daily to once and has discontinued the flight to Chittagong.Indian carrier IndiGo still continues to operate its twice-daily schedule, but sources said the airline was closely following the situation in Dhaka. The dip in passenger loads over the past few months, which has further accentuated in recent days, was a cause for concern, they said.The number of flights from Kolkata to Dhaka/Chittagong has dipped from 125 in Sept to 97 in Nov. Consequently, the count of departing passengers has reduced from 15,479 in Sept to 12,747 in Nov. The number of arrivals to Kolkata from Bangladesh has dipped from 114 in Sept to 96 in Nov, resulting in a drop in passenger count from 12,540 in Sept to 10,121 now.Bangladeshi carriers have been the worst-hit due to the crisis in the country. Biman Bangladesh flights from Kolkata are down from 59 in July to 28 in Nov while US-Bangla Airlines has fared worse with flight departures down from 84 in July to 24 now.In contrast, IndiGo flight departures are down from 62 in July to 45 in Nov, while arrivals during this period are down from 64 in July to 44 now.While Bangladeshis who depend on Kolkata for both commerce and healthcare are majorly impacted, a section of the economy in Kolkata, particularly hotels, restaurants and hospitals that serve Bangladeshis, have been dealt a body blow. Hotel occupancy in the Marquis Street-Sudder Street belt is down to 20% while shops and restaurants in and around New Market have witnessed a 65%-70% slide in sales.""Tourism, both conventional and local, as well as business, are impacted by the ongoing turmoil there. For most middle-class Bangladeshis, India is a foreign country within reach for medical as well as religious tourism where affordability, food and language are not a barrier. Unless the situation gets resolved, everyone will feel the pinch,"" said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (East) Anjani Dhanuka.","Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day.

Maharashtra government formation: Signal to Shinde? BJP says Maharashtra government oath on December 5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-government-formation-signal-to-shinde-bjp-says-maharashtra-government-oath-on-december-5/articleshow/115854029.cms,"CM will be from BJP, deputies from

& Sena, says Ajit

NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday announced that the new Mahayuti govt will be sworn in on Dec 5 in what is being seen as a signal to Eknath Shinde to make up his mind fast about joining the govt led by Devendra Fadnavis.State BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule said in a post on X that the swearing-in ceremony will take place at Azad Maidan and PM Modi would attend it. ""The wait for this historic swearing-in is over. We thank the public for their support,"" Bawankule said.The announcement came after talks had paused after the three Mahayuti netas, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar met home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. The unambiguous post on X and the timing of it came as a surprise because there has been no communication between Shinde and BJP since he left Delhi and headed to his village in Satara district, after which he has been reportedly unwell.Political circles in Delhi and Mumbai were unanimous that the post was a clear message to Shinde to come around and agree to be part of the Fadnavis govt.During deliberations, Shinde had raised the issue of the awkwardness of him joining govt as deputy CM after having served as CM of Mahayuti govt. Sources said Shah is learned to have told him calmly that even Fadnavis, an ex-CM, had joined him as deputy and it was not a decision Fadnavis took on his own but because he was asked to do so by the party.BJP's confidence is based on the numbers it has in the assembly: 132 plus five independents, which with Ajit's support swells to a daunting 178, putting the ball in Shinde's court.NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Saturday reiterated the CM would be from BJP and there would be two deputy chief ministers, one from NCP and the other from Shiv Sena However, Sena would, in addition to seeking the deputy CM's post, keep up its demand for the home portfolio and for retaining all the nine ministries it held in the Shinde-led govt, a Sena functionary said. These include the industries and urban development departments.Asked about Sena's demand for the home portfolio, Ajit Pawar said, ""It's the CM's prerogative to decide portfolios. There is no tug-of-war regarding portfolios.""Shiv Sena's Sanjay Shirsat justified the party's demand. ""When BJP held the deputy CM's post, they got the home portfolio. So it's only fair that we insist on it. If there is a dashing leader in charge of the home department, it will keep rioters at bay,"" he said.The Sena functionary said there are no backchannel talks or negotiations going on with BJP and any formula will only be discussed when Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar meet in person.""Before the meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, CM Shinde had made it clear he was wholeheartedly accepting of their decision on the next CM. In the Delhi meeting, no name for CM was announced. It was only indicated that the CM will be from BJP. It was decided that the exact formula will be decided by CM Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar in Mumbai and then reported to New Delhi. After CM Shinde's return from Delhi there has been no communication with BJP or NCP, and BJP hasn't elected its own legislature party leader,"" the Sena functionary said.In the outgoing govt, CM Shinde headed urban development department. Gulabrao Patil helmed water supply and sanitation, Dada Bhuse led ports and mining, Uday Samant was industries minister and Tanaji Sawant had public health and family welfare portfolio, among others.The Sena functionary said, ""Our ministers got only 2.5 years in this govt so they need more time to perform. Sena is clear on this. Whether CM Shinde is the DCM or he nominates someone else is his decision.""Meanwhile, Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said, ""Before the MVA govt was formed, they declared President's rule. Now after such a massive majority, the Mahayuti govt has still not been formed. The term of the assembly is over. Why hasn't President's rule been declared?"" Thackeray took a dig at Shinde's trip to his village in Satara on Friday. ""After such a massive majority, some people are going to their fields instead of Raj Bhavan,"" he said.Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut said, ""Shinde looks uneasy, both mentally and physically. The smile on his face and twinkle in his eyes is gone. It's like he was offered something which has been taken away,"" Raut said.Shiv Sena's Shirsat hit back at Raut, saying, ""After this verdict, it's clear to us whose mental balance has been affected.""","BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule says swearing-in ceremony will take place at Azad Maidan.

The city's 24-hour average AQI reached 325 ('very poor') at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) daily national bulletin.This was a deterioration from Wednesday's reading of 303 ('very poor').Weather analysts noted consistent wind speeds of 10-12 km/hr during both days, but predict reduced speeds over the weekend due to an approaching western disturbance.

(Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15.

However, the leaders have not placed any name in the public even a week after storming back to power with an unprecedented mandate.On Thursday, Mahayuti's leadership, including caretaker CM and Shiv Sena supremo Eknath Shinde , BJP's Devendra Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar, huddled at Union home minister Amit Shah's house to expedite the state government formation talks.Before the talks at Shah's house, Eknath Shinde had expressed his complete support for the BJP leadership's choice of the next chief minister, stating he would not obstruct the process.However, his visit to his native village in Satara raised eyebrows as it reportedly delayed the finalisation of the government formation process.Speaking on Shinde's visit, Shirsat said: ""Whenever Eknath Shinde thinks that he needs some time to think he goes to his native village.""""By tomorrow evening, he (Eknath Shinde) will take a big decision.

Swearing-in on December 5

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the next chief minister of Maharashtra will be from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while two deputy CMs will be from the Shiv Sena and his party.Pawar shared what transpired at Thursday's meeting that took place at Union home minister Amit Shah's house in New Delhi.""During the meeting (Delhi meeting of Mahayuti leader) it was decided that Mahayuti will form the government with CM from BJP and the remaining two parties will have DCMs... This is not the first time there has been a delay... If you remember, in 1999, one month was taken for government formation,"" Ajit Pawar told news agency ANI.On Thursday, a day after Eknath Shinde said he would accept the BJP leadership's decision on who should be the next Maharashtra CM, Mahayuti partners got down to working out details of the government, which is to be formed on December 5 . Amit Shah met three chiefs of the alliance — Eknath Shinde, Devendra Fadnavis & Ajit Pawar — on Thursday.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations told TOI.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar, BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism.However, Shine's visit to his native village in Satara raised eyebrows as it reportedly delayed the finalisation of the government formation process.Speaking on Shinde's visit, Shirsat said: ""Whenever Eknath Shinde thinks that he needs some time to think he goes to his native village.""""By tomorrow evening, he (Eknath Shinde) will take a big decision.

Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday

A day after the Mahayuti leaders' meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde left for his village Dare Tamb in Mahabaleshwar taluka in Satara district. Sources said the BJP is working on him to get him to accept the deputy CM's post.The swearing-in of the Maharashtra cabinet is unlikely until Dec 5 as the talks could only progress after partners agree on the return of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM with nominees of Shiv Sena and NCP as the two deputies.The swearing-in was earlier expected to be held on Monday. However, the negotiations are unlikely to be wrapped up because of the preoccupation of Amit Shah, who has to balance the competing demands of Mahayuti partners with the DGPs' conference until Saturday. Sources now expect the oath-taking to be scheduled on Dec 5 at Azad Maidan both because of the tricky nature of Shah's assignment and the engagements of PM Modi, who is billed to be the star of the show.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations said.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar , BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism. There also appears to be an understanding among the partners over the Speaker, an important figure when it comes to coalitions, being a BJP nominee. Significantly, Shinde dropped hints about Sena's interest in having his nominee as chairperson of the legislative council and BJP, according to sources, did not look averse to acceding to the desire as part of compensation to Shinde.The appreciation of Shinde's contribution in Mahayuti's grand return and the ""sacrifice"" he is likely to make for the sake of the unity of the alliance will not extend to BJP acquiescing in an insistence for the home department. Fadnavis would get to retain home, while Ajit Pawar is seen as a shoe-in for sixth term as finance minister of the richest and the most industrialised state.Both Shiv Sena and NCP have argued that the power-sharing arrangement cannot be worked out merely on the basis of mathematics because doing so would, for all practical purposes, mean installing a BJP regime, given that the party's own numbers are within striking distance of the magic mark of 145. However, unlike a scheme based on numbers where berths are assigned on the basis of who has got how many MLAs, crafting an arrangement expected to be based on abstract considerations like ""fairness"" and ""objectivity"" can be difficult, with each partner having notions which may not gel.In Delhi, Shinde, speaking to the media on Thursday night, said the meeting with Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, along with his colleagues from the Mahayuti-Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar-was cordial. ""The meeting was to discuss govt formation. Today was the first meeting; tomorrow, a second meeting will be held in Mumbai on CM and portfolio allocation. I have already announced Shiv Sena's support to Mahayuti CM candidate, so that deadlock was resolved,"" he said.When no Mahayuti meeting happened and news came that Shinde would be in the village for the next two days, his colleague Uday Samant told media that Shinde was running a fever the past couple of days and went to his village, to a healthier environment to recuperate.Asked if Shinde would accept dy CM's post, Samant said, ""We want Shinde Saheb to be in Maharashtra politics, and he should be in govt."" Sources said there is Shani Amavasya on Saturday and Sunday, additional reasons for no action happening.BJP sources said its elected MLAs have so far not been called to Mumbai to elect the party's legislative leader. ""This meeting is likely to be held on Monday. Thereafter, the legislative heads of the three parties will meet to decide on the CM, Dy CM posts and portfolio allocation,"" sources said.BJP sources said if Fadnavis, a former CM, could be dy CM, then Shinde too could take up the post, adding it would send out a clear message that it is not just BJP netas who have to compromise.",Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday.

Delhi is facing a complete law and order breakdown under BJP’s rule.""Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Saturday alleged that the man wanted to set Kejriwal afire after throwing spirit on him during his Padyatra campaign. In a post on X, Bharadwaj also alleged that the attacker was connected with the BJP.This latest incident follows a similar attack in October, when AAP claimed that Kejriwal was targeted during a rally in Delhi. The party accused the BJP of orchestrating the attack by mobilizing its supporters to disrupt the event.Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva said that the incident was a 'political drama' orchestrated by Kejriwal ahead of Delhi elections. Sachdeva told ANI, ""I have been saying since day 1 that Arvind Kejriwal will get himself slapped and get things thrown at him. As per the information, it was just water and the person is their local worker. He has been caught in an intoxicated state. This is a political drama. This is disappointment and hopelessness. Nothing is working now so they are making such cliche moves.""Responding to the incident, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, ""Whenever a leader goes for a Padyatra, he comes in a very close proximity with the people. Hence, such incidents happen even after strong security. But it is the mistake of that person. He should have asked his question instead of doing this. The people are enraged because the streets are broken, drains are overflowing and the pollution level is high.""This attack is not the first of its kind that Kejriwal has faced. Back in 2016, the AAP leader was targeted with ink during a visit to Bikaner, Rajasthan, where he had attended a condolence meeting for a local AAP leader.Since his political debut in 2013, Kejriwal has faced several similar attacks.With just months left before the Delhi Assembly elections, AAP has ramped up its efforts to engage voters and strengthen its grassroots support. Kejriwal, along with senior party leaders, is actively participating in padyatras across the city, reaching out to constituents and discussing the party's agenda. These foot marches are part of the second phase of a broader strategy designed to bolster AAP's presence ahead of the polls.Kejriwal, while campaigning on Friday, announced that registration for the Rs 1,000 monthly honorarium for women under the ‘ Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana ’ will begin soon. He also accused the BJP of failing to provide essential services like uninterrupted electricity, quality healthcare, and good schools, despite governing in 22 states across the country.","Ashok Jha, serving bus marshal at Delhi Transport Corporation's Khanpur Depot, has been detained.

'Sounded happy 15 minutes before suicide': What we know so far about Air India pilot Srishti Tuli's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sounded-happy-15-minutes-before-suicide-what-we-know-so-far-about-air-india-pilot-srishti-tulis-death/articleshow/115841543.cms,"Tuli's family alleges foul play, as she sounded happy 15 minutes before her death.

What do we know so far about Air India pilot Srishti Tuli's suicide?

Tuli was found hanging with a data cable in her flat after a distress call to Pandit.

Police detained Pandit based on an FIR filed by Tuli's uncle, accusing him of abetment of suicide under Section 108 of the BNS.

Tuli’s family revealed she spoke with her mother shortly before her death and appeared happy. Her uncle said, “What went wrong in those 15 minutes is something the police have to find out.”

Tuli’s uncle claimed Pandit had coerced her into transferring Rs 15,000 last month and Rs 50,000 in November. He also allegedly made her pay for his shopping and food bills via QR codes.

Pandit’s lawyer argued his client made 90 calls to Tuli while returning to Mumbai after her distressing video call. “If his intentions were wrong, why would he return and take her to the hospital?” said the lawyer.

Investigators have seized Pandit’s mobile phone and are attempting to recover deleted WhatsApp messages, which they believe could provide crucial insights into their relationship and the incident.

Pandit told the police he deleted the messages because he had threatened self-harm if Tuli died. ""When questioned about the deleted messages, he stated he had threatened self-harm if she died. Police are sceptical of his explanation and are working with forensic experts to recover the deleted content,"" a police officer told TOI.

Authorities told TOI that Tuli had been in a heated argument with Pandit before her death. On the night of the incident, she reportedly made a video call threatening self-harm.

Police are scrutinising Pandit’s failure to alert authorities about Tuli’s threats and his decision to access her flat without involving law enforcement.

Tuli and Pandit met two years ago while training as commercial pilots in Delhi. Pandit, who reportedly failed his qualification exams, is believed to have contributed to Tuli’s mental distress.

NEW DELHI: As the mystery surrounding the suicide of Air India pilot, Srishti Tuli continued, her family members told TOI that she spoke to them just 15 minutes before taking the extreme step. Her boyfriend, Aditya Pandit, whose custody has been extended until 2 December, also allegedly made Tuli pay for his food and shopping bills by sending her QR codes. According to her uncle, he also made her transfer Rs 15,000 in October and Rs 50,000 in November.Meanwhile, Pandit's lawyer maintained that he was falsely implicated in the case. He claimed that after speaking with Tuli, who said that she would end her life, Pandit immediately rushed back midway from Delhi and called her at least 90 times.Tuli was found hanging in her rented flat in Mumbai's Marol area on 25 November. She had reportedly called her boyfriend, saying ""she would end her life"", shortly before the incident, as per reports by news agency PTI. Pandit upon reaching her flat found it to be locked from the inside. After calling a locksmith to open the door, Tuli was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at Seven Hills Hospital. As per the report, no suicide note was discovered at the scene.Pandit, 27, was arrested and charged with abetment of suicide following allegations from Tuli’s uncle, who accused him of harassment, emotional abuse, and forcing her to change her dietary habits. The investigators are also working to retrieve deleted WhatsApp chats between him and Tuli, which are believed to hold critical clues about the events leading up to her death.","Sririshti Tuli was found hanging in her flat in Mumbai on 25 November.

He had left his home in Imphal West at 9 am for work, but failed to return later that afternoon. His family reported his disappearance after attempts to contact him failed. Kamalbabu’s younger brother filed a missing person's report, stating that Kamalbabu had been seen inside the Army campus, accompanied by a Nepali individual, before his phone was switched off.The Indian Army had launched an extensive search operation, which includes ground combing, drone surveillance, and aerial platforms in the military station and surrounding villages. The defence public relations office confirmed that the search was ramped up after they received the missing person report, which came on the evening of November 25. Despite these efforts, Kamalbabu’s whereabouts remain unknown.A joint action committee, formed by local residents, staged a sit-in protest in Imphal West on Wednesday, demanding that the Army ensure Kamalbabu’s safe return. The protesters insisted that the Indian Army be held accountable for the incident, calling for immediate action to locate the missing man.Chief minister Biren Singh said that the Army holds responsibility for tracing Kamalbabu, especially considering the gravity of the situation. He acknowledged the ongoing unrest caused by the incident, coming on the heels of another tragedy in Jiribam, where three women and three children were killed. Singh confirmed that the state government, alongside the Army, has been in touch with central officials to expedite the search.","Laishram Kamalbabu, 56, went missing from the Leimakhong Army camp on November 25.

She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.

The building, originally a single-story structure, had been reportedly expanded to five stories without the required approvals.According to a PTI report, Latif Mohammad, president of the Sanjauli mosque committee, offered to voluntarily remove the three unauthorized floors in response to the court’s order. He sought permission from the municipal commissioner to proceed with the demolition. The municipal commissioner’s court subsequently issued an order on October 5, 2024, authorising the demolition, and gave two months to complete the task.AHMO contested the demolition order, arguing that Latif Mohammad lacked the authority to represent the mosque in this matter. However, Mohammad has consistently maintained that he has held this position since 2006 and was notified by the municipal commissioner’s court in his capacity as president regarding the demolition order.Mohammad also cited logistical challenges in carrying out the demolition, noting a shortage of available labor, as many workers had returned to their home states. ""However, whatever decision the court will take, we will accept it,"" he said.The Waqf Board claims ownership of the land on which the mosque stands. However, local residents have disputed this, asserting that the land belongs to the state revenue department.

NEW DELHI: Stating that state should not arbitrarily reject a scheme for petty political gains, Centre has urged Tamil Nadu (TN) government to reconsider its decision to reject the Prime Minister’s Vishwakarma Scheme, which aims to uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople on Saturday. Minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), Jayant Chaudhary , emphasised that the scheme is designed to foster social and economic mobility for individuals engaged in 18 traditional trades and crafts, and is “not caste-oriented,"" as alleged by TN.Chief minister M K Stalin recently informed union minister for MSMEs Jitan Ram Manjhi that Tamil Nadu would not implement the scheme in its current form, citing concerns over caste-based discrimination and a lack of inclusivity . Instead, Tamil Nadu plans to develop its own initiative to support artisans. Stalin also highlighted issues with the scheme's eligibility criteria, proposing changes such as removing the requirement for applicants’ families to have a history in traditional trades and raising the minimum age for eligibility to 35.Responding to these concerns, MSDE reiterated the inclusivity of the PM Vishwakarma Scheme . A statement from the ministry clarified that the scheme transcends caste and gender barriers, offering support for artisans from diverse backgrounds. Nationally, 2.45 crore applications have been received, with Tamil Nadu contributing 8.52 lakh registrations, of which 75.78% are from women. The MSDE also noted that the scheme’s demographic representation includes 19.89% scheduled castes, 6.69% scheduled tribes, 50.28% other backward classes, and 23.14% from the general category.Highlighting the scheme’s achievements, the Centre reported that over 10 lakh artisans have been trained, and loans worth Rs 1,909.43 crores have been sanctioned to over 2.21 lakh beneficiaries. Chaudhary warned that TN’s rejection of the scheme would deprive its artisans of significant benefits, urging the state to reconsider what he termed a “partisan approach to governance.”Centre also reaffirmed its willingness to collaborate with TN to address local concerns while preserving the scheme’s core principles of respect, skill enhancement, and prosperity. “By adopting a partisan approach to governance, the Tamil Nadu State Government is only denying its citizens their rightful benefits of a scheme with a national footprint; further, one that is designed with the culture & spirit of the people of Tamil Nadu at its core!” said Chaudhary.",PM Vishwakarma Scheme aims to uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople.

A 27-year-old man was taken into custody after attacking his parents and uncle with a knife and when he attempted to escape the police by leaping over a wall at the Mayapuri police station in west Delhi, he fell and sustained a fatal head injury. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered in the case.Police claimed on Saturday that so far they had not received his medical records to confirm whether Anshuman Taneja, the deceased, had been receiving any medical treatment before the knife attack but they were probing if he was of ""unsound mind"".Taneja lived with his family on the first floor of a four-storey building in Mayapuri and was unemployed. His father, Brahm Prakash, a retired naval officer, his mother, Sunita, and his uncle, Ashwini, were being treated in hospital for stab injuries.Police received a PCR call on Nov 26 at 6am about dacoits having entered a house in Lajwanti Garden. A team from the local police station rushed to the scene but found instead that Taneja had stabbed his parents and uncle with a kitchen knife. He was waving the knife and the floor was covered in blood when the cops arrived.The investigators suspect that he first attacked his parents and then this uncle when the latter came down from the upper floor on hearing a commotion. The three received injuries on the neck, hands and waist.Taneja was taken into police custody and two cops were assigned to watch over him. ""He was first taken to a hospital for a check-up and then to Mayapuri police station,"" a police officer said. There, Taneja asked for water. When one of his escorts went to get water, Taneja pushed the other policeman and jumped over the wall at the police station, which is 4-5 metres high. He fell and injured his head and was taken to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries on Nov 28.""All due procedures are being followed in the investigation, and the family members are being kept updated about the process,"" police said.

AAP MLA Naresh Balyan arrested for 'links' with gangster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-mla-naresh-balyan-arrested-for-links-with-gangster/articleshow/115852540.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police's crime branch on Saturday arrested AAP MLA Naresh Balyan on charges of extortion. It has been alleged that he is operating with gangster Kapil Sangwan , who is behind many extortion and firing cases in the city.Sangwan, who is in alliance with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, is currently in the UK and has a red corner notice against him. Two of his shooters went on a rampage early Nov, firing indiscriminately at two business establishments in Paschim Vihar and Chhawla on the same day following extortion demands from Sangwan. At the end of Aug, Sangwan sent his shooters to fire at a popular confectionery outlet in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar after the owner refused to pay Rs 2 crore as protection money.The AAP MLA was under investigation since last year after an audio clip of a purported conversation between him and Sangwan, also known as Nandu, surfaced. On Saturday, Balyan was called in for questioning in the case. ""However, he didn't co-operate and was evasive, prompting the need for custodial interrogation,"" a senior crime branch officer said. He was arrested around 7 pm in FIR number 191/23, police said.The case pertains to a purported audio recording in which Sangwan and the MLA were allegedly overheard speaking on the phone and discussing 'vasooli (recovery)'. They talked about ""escalating threats, demanding ransom and distribution of the money collected"".""In one of the alleged cases discussed, the recovery was purportedly done from Guru Charan, the owner of ASD Builders. Charan was given death threats if he didn't make the payment, it was alleged. Charan filed a complaint with Delhi Police, prompting the action,"" the officer added.In the recording seized by police, the MLA allegedly asked about the target, to which Sangwan replied, saying that Guru Charan, a builder in Puran sector, was on his list. The gangster asked if the MLA would arrange recovery, he would make the ""necessary phone calls"".Balyan, who represents Delhi's Uttam Nagar constituency, also served as the DDC chairman for south Delhi.Sangwan has occupied a place in the list of top wanted gangsters after he orchestrated the assassination of INLD Haryana unit chief Nafe Singh Rathi. The fugitive has been operating a lucrative extortion racket through shooters recruited via social media. His brother, Jyoti Baba, is currently serving time in Tihar Jail.Sangwan has a rivalry with gangster Manjeet Mahal since the latter bumped off Sangwan's brother-in-law in 2015.

Every fifth road death was of a pedestrian in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-fifth-road-death-was-of-a-pedestrian-in-2023/articleshow/115852441.cms,"NEW DELHI: Every fifth death in road accidents was a pedestrian and 45% of all fatalities were those riding two-wheelers in 2023. In a first official statement, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said“over 1.72 lakh people died” in road crashes last year and around 35,000 of them were pedestrians.At an event in Lucknow, the minister said nearly five lakh crashes are registered annually and last year around 10,000 of the persons killed were below 18 years and approximately 35,000 road accidents were reported in areas outside schools and colleges (institutional areas). “Around 54,000 deaths were due to non-wearing of helmets by two-wheeler riders, 16,000 died for not wearing seatbelts and 12,000 were killed due to overloading of vehicles. Around 34,000 accidents were caused involving drivers without valid licence,” the minister said.Neither the road transport ministry nor National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) have released the reports of road and accidental deaths of last year. TOI on October 19 had first reported how 2023 recorded the maximum road fatalities (nearly 1.73 lakh) with Uttar Pradesh topping among states and UTs, followed by Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Gadkari said the highest number of road accident deaths in the world occurs in India and out of this, the maximum number of deaths are recorded in UP. “There were 44,000 road accidents in UP and 23,650 persons were killed. Of these, 1,800 deaths are those below 18 years and 10,000 are of pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. There were 8,726 deaths due to speeding in UP,” he added.The minister said road crashes are rising despite efforts to minimise them because people neither have respect nor fear for the law. “There are many reasons for accidents, but the biggest reason is human behavior. It’s also true that there are potholes on roads, there are not enough underpasses and foot over bridges. We have identified the black spots and these are being rectified on the National Highway by spending about Rs 40,000 crore. There are many state highways and district roads. It concerns the state govts as well. The cause of the accidents can be found and rectified,” Gadkari said.On the rising pedestrian deaths, road safety expert Rohit Baluja said, “The one major factor missing in our road development and traffic management is the traffic engineering. We are definitely making roads, but not managing them and pedestrians have no sense of safety. The authorities must understand that road users' habits are formed based on traffic engineering.”Responding to questions from students about the need for a mandatory curriculum on road safety in schools, the minister said that they are trying to ensure the state govts include “Rules of the Road”. Welcoming the move, former chief of International Road Federation K K Kapila said, “We have been suggesting this to the govt. Making children aware about rules of the road and safe behavior will help check road deaths.","Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said“over 1.72 lakh people died’ in road crashes last year.

""I agree that in democracy, we can discuss the issue (related to EVMs) and if there is no solution, the aggrieved parties can approach the Supreme Court. Even the Supreme Court has rejected the plea against the use of EVMs. It is weird the opposition sees no problem in EVMs when they win and blame it when they face defeat,"" he said.Adhav, though, said, ""The difference in the Lok Sabha and state assembly poll results is astonishing. It is nothing short of a miracle and therefore, I doubt the fairness of the process. When I pressed the button on the EVM machine, I realised that there is a possibility of manipulation. While raising the doubts, I understand that the responsibility of proving the manipulation lies upon me and some technical experts will throw light on it, but the process lacked fairness,"" the 95-year-old said.

NEW DELHI: Stating that a state should not arbitrarily reject a scheme for petty political gains, Centre Saturday urged Tamil Nadu govt to reconsider its decision to reject PM's Vishwakarma scheme, which aims to ""uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople"". Minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), Jayant Chaudhary emphasised that the scheme is designed to foster social and economic mobility for individuals engaged in 18 traditional trades and crafts, and is ""not caste-oriented"", as alleged by Tamil Nadu.CM M K Stalin had informed Union minister for MSMEs Jitan Ram Manjhi that Tamil Nadu will not implement the scheme in its current form, citing concerns over caste-based discrimination and a lack of inclusivity. Instead, it plans to develop its own initiative to support artisans.Stalin also highlighted issues with the scheme's eligibility criteria, proposing changes such as removing the requirement for applicants' families to have a history in traditional trades and raising the minimum age for eligibility to 35.Responding to these concerns, MSDE reiterated inclusivity of the scheme. A statement from the ministry clarified that the scheme transcends caste and gender barriers, offering support for artisans from diverse backgrounds. Nationally, 2.4 crore applications have been received, with Tamil Nadu contributing 8.5 lakh registrations, of which almost 76% are women. It noted that the scheme's demographic representation includes close to 20% SCs, 7% STs, 50% OBCs, and 23% from general category.Chaudhary said Tamil Nadu's rejection of the scheme will deprive its artisans of benefits, urging the state to reconsider what he termed a ""partisan approach to governance.""","PM's Vishwakarma scheme aims to ""uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople"" Tamil Nadu will not implement the scheme in its current form, citing concerns over caste-based discrimination and a lack of inclusivity.

Lost Cities and Found Fortunes: The Making of an Archaeological Breakthrough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lost-cities-and-found-fortunes-the-making-of-an-archaeological-breakthrough/articleshow/115851440.cms,"How Indus Civilisation Was Really Found

Q:

Why don't you tell us in a nutshell what 'Finding Forgotten Cities' was all about?

A:

Q:

What were the firsts that you unearthed during the course of this research

A:

Q:

In the hundred years since this research was made visible and more, how is it that archaeological excavations are being made more cost effective? Would new tools of say, AI, help in this way?

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:When I began the research which eventually culminated in 'Finding Forgotten Cities', it did not begin as research about how the Indus Civilisation was discovered. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of doing a biography of John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Survey, who in fact announced the discovery of the Indus Civilisation on Sept 20, 1924. So, you know, just a little over 100 years ago. And I thought it would be in the 'life and times' genre. As it so happened, when I began looking at the material which was in the file room of the Archaeological Survey of India, there was so much material which I felt could actually be woven into a story around the discovery of the Indus Civilisation. This is because the story itself covers a large part of Marshall's career. And what eventually emerged from these files was very different from what the given story that people thought about when they thought about the discovery ofMohenjo-daro and Harappa .I think there were several. My most favourite bit relates to the Italian Luigi Pio Tessitori . I knew that he had worked in Bikaner and had visited Kalibangan, but I didn't know the whole story about the fact that he had excavated Kalibangan, a Harappan city as we now know it, the first Harappan city to have been excavated after Alexander Cunningham's excavations of the 19th century at Harappa. And he had discovered seals there which were exactly like those from Harappa. He could not actually get the credit that he deserved because he passed away in his 30s after having contracted the Spanish flu. He died in Bikaner, and he's actually buried there.The second thing, which was very new to me, and this again is around another individual who is much better known. Rakhal Das Banerjee. Rakhal Das Banerjee was the excavator of Mohenjo-daro. But I didn't realise that when he actually went to excavate Mohenjo-daro in the winter of 1922, he knew that this was his last season in that part of India. That was because he had been involved in all kinds of financial irregularities. So he had got permission to excavate at Mohenjo-daro, but it was just by accident that these seals within the first few days were found below the platform where you have a large historical Buddhist stupa. And he was trained as an archaeologist. So he immediately realised the importance of what he had discovered. This again was a story that I was not aware of. The other thing that came as a big surprise to me was the kind of pressure that the Archaeological Survey worked under. Non-commercial departments in the British Raj were always under threat.I don't know how AI would help, but I can tell you the post-Independence history of the Indus Civilisation, which will provide some kind of insight into the shifts that have taken place in the way in which archeology is done. Now, when you think of a Mohenjo-daro or Harappa being excavated in the 1920s, you didn't actually have specialists from elsewhere as a part of the team there. So that, for example, when skeletons were found, they went immediately into disrepair because you didn't have anthropologists there. So today, on the other hand, you have these large multidisciplinary teams. So I think there has been a change in the way excavations are conducted. I don't think the problem really has been with money. The problem has been in terms of publications. There are just so many cities where we still don't have hard copies of reports. So today if you want to learn about a Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, you can go to these fat tomes and get all the details. But we do not have similar volumes that have been published on Rakhigarhi or others.",'Finding Forgotten Cities' is a new book about the discovery of the Indus Civilisation. The book is based on material found in the file room of the Archaeological Survey of India. The author reveals how the British Raj's non- commercial departments were under threat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115851446,imgsize-56752,width-400,resizemode-4/115851446.jpg"

As the biggest democracy in the world, it is India's duty to raise its voice when minorities are facing harassment anywhere, he claimed.He also accused Samajwadi Party neta and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav of acting as a shield for rioters and alleged that the party's members, including MPs, are involved in instigating violence rather than showing commitment to the restoration of peace. Targeting SP, he alleged that riots frequently broke out when it governed the state and that the opposition party has no faith in the police.BJP's reaction came after Yadav accused BJP of orchestrating violence in Sambhal.","Congress chief ministers, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should resign as they were elected through the same electoral process the opposition party is questioning.

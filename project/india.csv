NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant on Monday took oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , marking the start of a nearly 15-month tenure at the helm of the judiciary. President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath to Justice Kant.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, and commerce minister Piyush Goyal were present at the ceremony.He succeeds Justice BR Gavai, who demitted office on Sunday evening. Appointed on October 30, Justice Kant will serve until February 9, 2027, when he turns 65.Justice Kant was part of the Supreme Court bench that upheld the abrogation of Article 370, kept the colonial-era sedition law in abeyance by directing that no new FIRs be filed, and oversaw the presidential reference on the powers of Governors and the President regarding state bills.He asked the Election Commission to disclose the names of 65 lakh voters excluded from Bihar’s draft rolls, and reinstated a woman sarpanch who was unlawfully removed, pointing to gender bias. He directed that one-third of seats in bar associations, including the Supreme Court Bar Association, be reserved for women.Justice Kant was also on the bench that appointed a committee led by Justice Indu Malhotra to probe the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2022 Punjab visit, observing that such questions required “a judicially trained mind”.He upheld the One Rank-One Pension scheme and continues to hear cases filed by women officers seeking parity in permanent commission. He was part of the seven-judge bench that overruled the 1967 AMU judgment and served on the bench handling the Pegasus spyware case, stating that the state cannot get a “free pass under the guise of national security”.Born on February 10, 1962 in Hisar, Haryana, Justice Kant rose from a small-town practice to the country’s top judicial office. He stood “first class first” in his Master’s degree in law from Kurukshetra University and later served as Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. Known for his calm approach to public scrutiny, he had earlier said: “Frankly speaking, I call social media ‘unsocial media’ and I do not feel pressured by online comments. .. Fair criticism is always acceptable.”","Justice Surya Kant took oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India. He succeeds Justice BR Gavai, who demitted office on Sunday evening.

‘In memory of our brothers’: Russian Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

Also read |

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team.

"Garhwal villages ban costly gifts, fast food at weddings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/garhwal-villages-ban-costly-gifts-fast-food-at-weddings/articleshow/125528766.cms,"DEHRADUN: Nearly two dozen villages in Uttarakhand’s Chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings to curb rising social pressure and restore traditional practices. The rules, agreed upon unanimously by village representatives in the Jaunsar Bawar area, aim to return wedding celebrations to their cultural roots and reduce financial strain on families. Anyone violating the norms will be fined Rs 1 lakh by the gram panchayat.Rajender Tomar, head of the Doha village cluster, told TOI that the increasing display of wealth during weddings had created unhealthy competition in the region. “These customs were becoming a competition and creating unnecessary pressure,” he said. Villages including Dau, Doha, Chutou, Bajau, Ghingo and Kaitri are among those enforcing the new policy.As part of the decision, food items such as chowmein, momos and other fastfood snacks have been barred from wedding menus. Families are encouraged to serve traditional Garhwali cuisine made from local ingredients such as mandua and jhingora millets.The exchange of expensive gifts and luxury items has also been prohibited. Karmu Pal, a resident of Kyawa village, supported the move. “We’re happy our local cuisine and culture are being promoted. The new generation won’t forget where they come from.”The sentiment echoed in neighbouring Naugaon in Uttarkashi, where residents of Koti Thakral and Koti Banal agreed to ban DJ music and alcohol at weddings. Traditional folk music and local instrumentswill be mandatory at celebrations.","Nearly two dozen villages in Uttarakhand’s Chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings.

Police outpost comes up at seat of Reds’ Jantana Sarkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-outpost-comes-up-at-seat-of-reds-jantana-sarkar/articleshow/125528705.cms,"The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023

NAGPUR: Maharashtra forces on Sunday pushed deeper into Abujmarh than ever before, establishing a fortified police outpost in a lightning 24-hour operation at Phulnar — an isolated village in south Gadchiroli’s Bhamragarh division near the Chhattisgarh border — long regarded as the CPI (Maoist) command spine where insurgents once dictated life and law.Camp Gundurwahi stands exactly where the Maoists ran their Jantana Sarkar — the parallel govt that controlled the “Red Corridor” of Leftwing extremism for more than five decades. The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023, marking the deepest penetration into India’s most entrenched Maoist belt.The breakthrough aligns with Union home minister Amit Shah’s target of ending Maoist insurgency by March 31, 2026, through a mix of intelligence-driven security operations and rapid development in tribal belts. Shah has ruled out talks with armed groups, urging cadres to surrender and join mainstream life under the Centre’s rehabilitation policy.For years, Phulnar–Gundurwahi functioned as an impenetrable headquarters. PLGA fighters marched in olive green. Landmines and ambushes made even approaches kilometres away perilous. Reaching Phulnar was impossible for seven months due to flooding of the Parlakota river in monsoon.The remaining months were barred by PLGA guns. “Now, the Tricolour will fly here,” a senior officer said.The outpost was completed in a round-the-clock operation involving 1,050 personnel, including 1,000 C-60 commandos, 21 bomb-disposal squads, new constables, 500 special police officers, CRPF companies and private contractors. A convoy of four JCB bulldozers, seven trailers, two Poclain earthmoving machines and 25 trucks carved out a fully functional base with 12 porta cabins, Wi-Fi, RO plants, generator backup, toilets, watchtowers and bunkers.Phulnar, barely 4km from Chhattisgarh and 20km from Bhamragarh, once housed the feared Company No. 10 of PLGA — responsible for the 2016 kidnapping and killing of a C-60 commando. Months ago, security forces gunned down four of its cadres.Villagers repeatedly resisted police entry and openly backed Maoists until recently. Sunday signalled a sharp turn. More than 300 tribal residents from 10 surrounding villages attended the inauguration and Jan Jagran Melawa — a “people’s awakening” function. ADG (special operations) Chhering Dorje and Gadchiroli SP Neelotpal presided over the event.Neelotpal said work would resume on roads, bridges, mobile towers at Koparshi and Phulnar, and a sub-primary health centre, followed by state transport buses. “Improved security will finally allow seamless connectivity between Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, boosting commerce and development,” he said.Police launched a large civic outreach — distributing saris, blankets, utensils, mosquito nets, school kits, sports gear and food items while explaining govt schemes and peace benefits.","Camp Gundurwahi stands exactly where the Maoists ran their Jantana Sarkar.

Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal. However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings.

NEW DELHI: Amid the political row kicked up by the proposed constitutional amendment to bring Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240, home ministry Sunday clarified that the proposal neither ""seeks to alter Chandigarh's governance or administrative structure"" nor ""change the traditional arrangements between Chandigarh and the states of Punjab and Haryana"".In a post on X, the home ministry held out the reassurance that the central govt has no intention of introducing any Bill on the issue in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.The statement followed protests from political parties in Punjab which claimed that the proposed amendment to put the administration of Chandigarh under a lieutenant governor, in line with other Union territories which don't have assemblies, was an attempt to weaken Punjab's control over the UT.The parties were reacting to a Lok Sabha bulletin listing the bills the govt could consider moving in the Winter session. Chandigarh is currently governed by an administrator, a position vested in the Punjab governor.The home ministry's post said the intention behind the proposal was to only simplify the central govt's law-making process for the Union territory of Chandigarh.

'No Longer Optional': PM Modi Calls For UNSC Reforms At IBSA Meet; Urges United Stand Against Terror

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.","PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

India’s ODI squad:

India have announced their squad for the three ODIs against South Africa, and as expected, KL Rahul will lead the side in the series starting November 30.In a notable development, Axar Patel has not been included, while Ravindra Jadeja returns to the ODI mix after being dropped for the series against Australia. The other surprising omission from the squad is Varun Chakravarthy, who was India’s trump card in the Champions Trophy.Ashad first reported on November 22 , regular captain Shubman Gill wasn’t available due to a neck injury, Hardik Pandya is yet to regain match fitness, and Jasprit Bumrah has been rested for the series. Tilak Varma’s addition to the middle order is a sign of things to come, as the team management is keen to inject more left-handers into the middle order.India have had a very right-hand–dominated ODI batting order, and in the build-up to the 2027 ODI World Cup, different combinations will be tried. Tilak and Rishabh Pant could get their chances in the upcoming fixtures, as Shreyas Iyer’s injury allows the think tank to explore all options before the vice-captain regains match fitness.The biggest talking point, however, remains Jadeja over Axar Patel. Not too long ago, the men’s senior selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar had ignored Jadeja for the ODI series in Australia.Agarkar had explained why there was no need for an extra left-arm spinner and clearly indicated that Axar was ahead of Jadeja in the format.“He is very much in the plans. But there will be some competition for places. Of course, he was there in the Champions Trophy squad because we took those extra spinners with the conditions there. At the moment, we could only carry one and get some balance in the team with Washi and Kuldeep there as well. And I don’t think we are going to need more than that in Australia,” Agarkar had said.Axar picked up three wickets in as many games and made contributions of 31 and 44 in the two opportunities with the bat but didn’t make the 15-member squad for the three games against South Africa.Veteran speedster Mohammed Shami continues to be ignored, even after proving his match fitness in the domestic circuit, as selectors have stuck with the likes of Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Arshdeep Singh. Mohammed Siraj also seems to have been rested for the series.Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, KL Rahul (C) (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Prasidh Krishna, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel","India have announced their squad for the three ODIs against South Africa.

IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

'It was uncomfortable for me'





Captain Taylor Hiester, a pilot of the US F-16 team who was at the Dubai Air Show where a Tejas fighter jet crashed, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal, expressed his disbelief and shock that the show was not cancelled even after the tragic event. Hiester said their team was preparing their show when the accident took place. The event was not called off despite the tragedy but the US team and a few other decided to cancel their performance out of respect to the pilot and his colleagues and family.As he headed to the US, he shared his emotions which were a mix of shock and discomfort as he also slammed the organisers for going on with the show.""After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season. Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,"" Hiester wrote.Hiester recounted that after the fire was put out, the organisers notified the participants that the display would continue. Their team left but he returned to the site an hour or two later hoping that he would find an empty space.But to his disappointment, the announcer was still enthusiastic and people were watching the show.Hiester said the moment was uncomfortable for him as he imagined his team walking out of the show without him and other participants preparing for their performance. ""I was shaken awake by this truth -- despite whatever guise, whatever 'rockstar treatment', fancy dinners and sponsor chlets, my team who became my family is all I ever had in the first place.""Questioning the concept of 'the show must go on', Hiester said it is true that the show must go on but everyone should remember that the show will go one when they are gone too.","US F-16 pilot Taylor Hiester was at the Dubai Air Show where a Tejas fighter jet crashed, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal.

The court allowed him to cross-examine witnesses via video-conferencing.The next hearing of the case is scheduled for November 29.","A second ""key eyewitness"" has identified in court jailed Kashmiri separatist Yasin Malik as the ""main shooter"" in the 1990 terrorist attack.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan. Look at what is happening today with Al-Falah. He (the founder) is in jail, and how many years he will spend in jail, no one knows,"" Madani, chief of one of the two JUH factions, said, speaking at a session at Jamiat headquarters in Delhi Saturday.The founder of Al-Falah University, Jawed Siddiqui, is in custody of the Enforcement Directorate. Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told PTI, ""In the name of vote bank, the 'bhaijann of appeasement' and the 'aatanki bachao jamaat (save terrorists group)' has become active."" He added, ""Arshad Madani ji, leave aside this talk of mayor; this country has seen Muslims becoming president, vice president, chief justice, home minister. The biggest artists and businessmen have also come from the Muslim community. "" BJP member Shahnawaz Hussain slammed Madani's statement as ""very irresponsible"".However, some Congress netas saw merit in Madani's remarks. Former MP Sandeep Dikshit said, ""This govt has launched a very systematic campaign against a particular religion."" At the same time, he made it clear that Madani's linking the issue to Al-Falah is not right. ""I hope that in the case of Al-Falah doctors, the NIA will conduct an impartial probe,"" he said.Congress' Rashid Alvi said, ""Take strict action against those who are responsible, who are terrorists, spreading terror, breaking the law, whoever they may be.

Living in a parasocial world: When your new 'best friend' is a popular stranger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/living-in-a-parasocial-world-when-your-new-best-friend-is-a-popular-stranger/articleshow/125520076.cms,"Scroll, feel, repeat: How social media made parasocial love universal

parasocial

The performance of being real

'I screamed like my best friend got engaged': The Swiftie syndrome



It is a 'delicate' 'love story'.

When your hero wins, you win too

It's a messy love affair.

Concerts: When the screen comes alive

Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5 and Akon perform in India!

The expense of a parasocial.

The grief of losing someone who never knew you

The parasocial economy: When intimacy becomes a currency

We’re all parasocial

So is this good or bad?

The final truth

In 2025,became the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year — and honestly, could there be a more fitting choice? We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens. The distance between us and the people we admire has collapsed so dramatically that for many, these aren’t public figures anymore — they feel like friends. Confidants. Extensions of ourselves.The word itself describes a one-sided emotional bond formed with someone we don’t know — a celebrity, influencer, streamer, or even a fictional character. But today, parasocial barely feels like an academic term. It feels like a daily lived reality.Instagram is no longer 'just an app'; it’s the new Netflix, feeding us episodic glimpses into people’s lives with cliffhangers, plot twists, soft-launches, and heartbreak arcs. Our idols aren’t just entertainers — they’re protagonists in a never-ending reality show, one we binge-watch with the devotion we once reserved for scripted television.Once upon a time, celebrity culture was mysterious, aspirational, placed firmly behind velvet ropes and PR filters.Today, the doors are flung open.Everyone — from A-list stars to teenagers with a ring light — is telling their story online.And the more people share, the closer we feel. Or at least, the closer we think we feel.Livestreams, photo dumps, notes-app confessions, 'get ready with me' videos, chaotic vlogs, 2am heartbreak stories, pilates classes, pet updates, skincare routines — the everyday has become theatrical. And we, the audience, become emotionally entangled in narratives that aren’t ours.You may never have met that influencer you check on every day. You may never have spoken to the actor whose divorce devastates you or the singer whose cryptic lyric you analyze for hidden truths. But our minds don’t always distinguish between real closeness and repeated, intimate exposure.The more we see someone, the more we feel we know them. The more they 'share,' the more we believe that access = intimacy.The parasocial world thrives on that illusionFor some, this bond becomes an identity.""I’m such a Swiftie that when Taylor announced her engagement, I screamed like my actual best friend was getting married. I’ve seen her fight for her music, reinvent whole eras, and drop breakup songs that can resurrect a dead party. Now my entire feed is nothing but Taylor easter eggs and Opalite reels. She has no idea I exist, but I’m emotionally invested like we’ve grown up together,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee, demonstrating peak parasocial bond.What’s fascinating is how common this feeling is — not embarrassing, not fringe, but culturally dominant. Entire communities are built around these shared emotional investments.Similarly, Shameen Alauddin has been invested in Nina Dobrev's life for almost 15 years now. ""Nina Dobrev is one of those celebrities who has quietly stayed in my life for almost 15 years. It’s like Dobrev became someone I rooted for without even realising it was happening; I am not tracking every little thing she does, but it is her personality that keeps me invested.""Celebrity culture used to be a conversation between fan magazines and fans. Now it’s a relationship. Or at least, the illusion of one.The parasocial bond isn’t limited to pop stars — athletes ignite it with equal intensity. Watching sports has always carried emotion, but in our hyper-connected world, fans often feel tied to players as if they were family.""The first full season I watched Messi glide through defenders, I truly believed magic exists and here was a man that made me believe in it. His biggest moments have felt personal: his departure from Barcelona felt like being uprooted from home, and his World Cup win gave me a joy so deep it still lives in my chest years later,"" said a starry-eyed Nakul Jain, who physically lives in Bengaluru, but believes he is Argentinian.""The way he carries himself, his humility and quiet strength, shapes how I move through life. And every time he wins, it feels like I win too… because fighting for him, loving him, and believing in him feels like defending a part of myself that still believes in magic,"" he added.This is the power of parasocial attachment — it’s not 'just fandom.' It becomes a mirror for our own emotional lives.Their battles feel like metaphors for ours. Their victories heal wounds we didn’t know were open. Their losses feel like personal tragedies.And then there’s the moment when the story you’ve been watching through a screen suddenly appears in 4K reality — concerts.There is nothing quite like standing in a stadium, surrounded by thousands of people who share your emotional vocabulary, waiting for the person whose voice has narrated your life. The lights dim. The first chords ring out. And suddenly, your parasocial relationship acquires a heartbeat.I attended a few concerts recently — Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5, Akon — and the experience was surreal. It was a collision of worlds: the digital, curated presence I had consumed for years and the embodied, breathing version standing right there on the stage.When Chris Martin broke into 'Fix You,' it felt like collective therapy.When Sheeran looped his guitar and built a song from scratch, it felt intimate, like he was doing it just for us.When Adam Levine swaggered across the stage, the entire stadium screamed like they had been waiting their whole lives for that exact moment.That’s the strange beauty of parasocial experiences — your idol doesn’t know your name, but you know their gestures, their smile, their stage banter, the exact way their voice cracks on that one high note. Seeing them in person felt like meeting someone familiar, someone whose existence has threaded through your memories. These concerts emptied my wallet but filled my heart. And that’s exactly what parasocial joy feels like — irrational, extravagant, but deeply, deeply human.Parasocial bonds don’t just give us joy — they give us grief.When beloved public figures die, the world mourns collectively, but privately too. It’s an ache that might feel disproportionate but isn’t. We grieve not just the person, but the era of ourselves they represented.When Satish Shah passed away recently — especially for fans of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai — it felt like losing a piece of our childhood living room. Indravardhan Sarabhai was more than a character; he was a personality stitched into our nostalgia, our humour, our shared pop culture shorthand.Matthew Perry’s death felt even more shattering. Chandler Bing was the friend in our living room for ten seasons, the voice in the background during college, the comfort show after breakups. The man behind that character battled demons we only understood later, and his passing felt heartbreakingly personal. Maggie Smith , whose characters shaped multiple generations — from Professor McGonagall to Violet Crawley — represented wisdom, wit, and authority. Her passing felt like the world losing a certain type of dignity.""I felt something similar when Liam Payne died. I slipped back into that old One Direction fan mode without planning it — rewatching performances, scrolling through timelines, trying to take in the news. It wasn’t about being attached to him as a person, but about the memories of my teenage self being a fan of that boy band. When one of them was suddenly gone, it made me realise that even when you don’t actively think of yourself as a ‘stan’, the version of you who once was can come rushing back,"" said Shameen.These people never knew us. But we knew them — or at least, a version of them. And the loss feels real because the relationships felt real.Influencers today aren’t just creators; they’re brands built on relatability. Their value comes from their ability to maintain the illusion that you are part of their inner circle.This means:- sharing personal struggles- opening up about mental health- soft-launching partners- crying on camera- revealing childhood traumas- letting viewers 'get ready' with them- inviting audiences to vote on their outfit, hairstyle, breakfast, life choicesIt’s intimacy as strategy. Vulnerability as content. Connection as a business model.Even though it’s designed, we still fall for it — because humans are wired for connection. If someone looks into a camera and talks like they’re talking to you, your brain often defaults to believing it.Why parasocial bonds feel so good — and so dangerousParasocial relationships give us:✔ comfort✔ consistency✔ emotional release✔ community✔ the illusion of stability✔ a safe escapeBut they also blur the lines between fantasy and reality. They also give us:- Expectation of emotional reciprocity- Comparisons of our lives to others’ curated narratives- Attachments based on edited glimpses- Guilt, jealousy, loyalty, and heartbreak over people we’ve never metIf we peel back the layers, parasocial attachment isn’t a glitch — it’s a feature of our era.And because everyone is online now — not just celebrities — parasocial dynamics exist between regular people too. We follow acquaintances, colleagues, strangers, creators, and micro-influencers and build internal impressions of their lives, personalities, and journeys without truly knowing them.We’re all characters in each other’s feeds. We’re all building one-sided familiarity with people who barely think of us. We’re all simultaneously the watchers and the watched.This is the new human condition — intimate yet lonely, connected yet curated, expressive yet isolated.Honestly — it’s both.Parasocial relationships can bring joy, inspiration, healing, motivation, creativity, and community. They can also bring heartbreak, comparison, obsession, and confusion.The key is awareness - to love the art without believing we own the artist, to enjoy the connection without mistaking it for a relationship, to cherish the comfort without collapsing into dependency, to admire someone without dissolving into their narrative.We may live in a parasocial world, but that’s not inherently tragic. It’s simply a new kind of human connection — born from the technology we created, shaped by the emotions we’ve always carried.Because at the end of the day, whether it’s Taylor, Messi, Ed Sheeran, Satish Shah, Matthew Perry, or Maggie Smith… parasocial love is still love. Real or imagined, it tells us something true about ourselves — what we value, what we long for, what we grieve, what we hope for. And maybe the most human thing of all is caring deeply about people who’ll never know our names.","In 2025, parasocial became the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year. The word describes a one-sided emotional bond formed with someone we don’t know. We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521843,imgsize-1390888,width-400,resizemode-4/november-21-3.jpg"

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DLEHI: The French Navy on Sunday criticised Pakistani media for publishing what it described as “misinformation and disinformation” about India’s Operation Sindoor , after one outlet claimed a French officer had confirmed Pakistani air superiority and the shooting down of Indian Rafale jets during a border confrontation earlier this year in May.In a statement issued on its official X handle, the ‘Marine Nationale’ said the article had fabricated comments and even misidentified the officer involved.“FAKENEWS: These statements were attributed to Captain Launay who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,” the post said. Pakistan based broadcaster Geo TV’s November 21 report had quoted a “Jacques Launay” as allegedly praising the Pakistan air force during a supposed May 6–7 aerial engagement involving over 140 fighters, and claiming Indian Rafales were downed with Chinese support. The French Navy said the officer’s real name is Captain Yvan Launay - and none of the comments attributed to him were genuine.Clarifying his actual role, the Navy said: “First name is Yvan, not Jacquis. Contrary to what has been established in the article, his responsibilities are limited to commanding the organic naval air station where the French Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed.”According to the statement, Captain Launay’s presentation at the Indo-Pacific conference was strictly technical.“Captain Yvan Launay presented the assets of his naval air base, the missions of the Rafale fighter jet, and the French carrier strike group concept,” it said.Responding to questions at the event, Launay “neither confirmed nor denied that Indian aircrafts had been shot down” during Operation Sindoor and “refused to comment on possible jamming of the Indian Rafale by Chinese systems.” The Navy added that “he never mentioned the Chinese J10.”These clarifications directly contradicted another claim published by the Pakistani outlet, which had said Launay linked alleged Rafale performance issues to operational shortcomings and compared the jet with the Chinese J-10C. The Navy reiterated that such references were never made.The BJP spokesperson and its IT cell chief Amit Malviya reacting to the post by French navy called out the Geo TV's report as ""same old, fabricated claims."" He also took a dig at the journalist behind it Hamid Mir.In a post on X he said, ""The French Navy has called out Pakistan’s Geo TV and its correspondent Hamid Mir for spreading “misinformation and disinformation.” In his report, Hamid Mir peddled the same old, fabricated claims about Rafales and the so-called May conflict and has now been publicly exposed. When official institutions start debunking their propaganda, you know how desperate Pakistan’s misinformation machinery has become. Incidentally Hamid Mir has several friends in Indian media. Spot them.""France’s rebuttal comes days after a US report by US-China Economic and Review Commission exposed how in aftermath of Operation Sindoor, China initiated a “disinformation campaign” to “hinder the sales of French Rafale aircraft in favour of its own J-35s, using fake social media accounts to propagate AI images of supposed debris from the planes that China’s weapon destroyed.”The Operation Sindoor was launched in response to the dastardly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22 earlier this year, in which 26 civilians were killed - the incident later prompted Indian response targeting Pakistan-sponsored terrorist sites.",French navy slams Pakistan's misinformation campaign about India's Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing."" He went on to add that because of NDA being in minority in Rajya Sabha back then, the bill collapsed in the upper house, but Amit Shah taking over the home affairs continued the work in the direction, a possible reference to Citizenship Amendment Act.""People from the Sindhi community and various other non-Muslim groups had fled to Delhi, where they were living in slums in extremely distressing conditions. I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday"" Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,imgsize-609930,width-400,resizemode-4/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-pti.jpg"

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

"BJP objects to Muslim intake in Vaishno Devi Medical College, stirs row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-objects-to-muslim-intake-in-vaishno-devi-medical-college-stirs-row/articleshow/125524776.cms,"Representative image

SRINAGAR: BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal have objected to admissions of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra after freshers from the community formed the bulk of the institution’s first batch.This marks a potential new Jammu versus Kashmir political row as J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) and opposition PDP have slammed the objections. Although the college filled seats strictly on NEET’s merit list and reserved 85% of its seats for J&K domiciles, only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50.After the admissions were completed earlier this month, VHP and Bajrang Dal were the first to protest, arguing that an institution funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindus only. They also insisted that the college, funded through donations from Hindu devotees, should serve Hindus’ interests.On Saturday, BJP’s Sunil Sharma formally lodged a protest with J&K lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, who is ex-officio chairman of the shrine board, submitting a memorandum seeking corrective measures and a review of admission norms.Without seeking minority status for the medical college, Sharma made it clear that his party had objected to the intake of “the majority of students from a particular community”.“Donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus. We are upset with the board and the college because they did not consider this sentiment. We told the LG that only those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission. This year’s admission is not acceptable to people here. The rules should be changed,” Sharma said.In Kashmir, where medical studies are preferred by many, BJP’s protests have not gone down well. “If hospitals, schools, universities, and medical colleges start deciding intakes on the basis of religion, what kind of country will we become? Tomorrow, will a patient be treated according to their faith? Will merit be pushed aside to satisfy majoritarian demands? This is a recipe for disaster,” NC MLA and spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said.BJP’s stance on Vaishno Devi Medical College, where selections are purely merit-based, is not just misguided but dangerous, Sadiq argued. “A shrine-funded institution does not become a religion-based institution. Donations made out of devotion cannot be converted into tools of discrimination,” Sadiq added, urging BJP not to turn our institutions into “battlegrounds of faith”.PDP’s Iltija Mufti criticised BJP’s stand but did so while taking a dig at NC and its CM Omar Abdullah. “In ‘Naya Kashmir’, discrimination towards Muslims now extends to education. The irony is that this anti-Muslim apartheid is being legitimised and carried out in India’s only Muslim majority state with its only Muslim chief minister,” Iltija said.Peoples Conference chairman and legislator Sajad Lone alleged that BJP’s stance amounted to “experimenting with the concept of communalising medical sciences”. “I hope they understand there is a proper admission test called NEET. And that is an all-India test,” Lone said.","BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal have objected to admissions of Muslim students to Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra.

'Creamy layer' cornering big share of jobs quota: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creamy-layer-cornering-big-share-of-jobs-quota-cji-gavai/articleshow/125525604.cms,"CJI Gavai (File photo)



NEW DELHI: On his last day in office, CJI Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai, the second from Dalit community to head the judiciary, said it is worrisome that caste is being weaponised by the socially and economically uplifted among SC/ST communities to corner a major portion of reservation in jobs.CJI Gavai also expressed concern over the spiraling social tendency to indulge in hate speech and said it is for Parliament to debate and, if needed, legislate new norms and mechanisms to curb the phenomenon. Reasonable restrictions on free speech under the Constitution appear inadequate to deal with rampant hate speech on social media. ""Personally, I think that some sort of regulatory mechanism needs to be put in place,"" the CJI remarked.Speaking to TOI, CJI Gavai said it is high time that Centre and the states sub-categorised SC/ST communities to enable those who continue to be socially, economically and educationally backward among these communities to reap the benefits of quota in govt jobs.As regards the verdict of a seven-judge bench headed by him that had permitted states to sub-categorise castes within SC communities based on socio-economic backwardness and the degree of under-representation in govt jobs, ensuring that the larger pie of quota in jobs went to the most backward, the CJI said that despite criticism from his own community, he strongly feels that the 'creamy layer' among SC/ST communities must give way to the deprived among these communities.Asked about the best and worst moments in his tenure as CJI, he said that while the judgment against bulldozer justice was the most satisfying one he had delivered, the way Justice Ujjal Bhuyan criticised his majority view in a recent verdict that overturned the earlier SC verdict on Bills passed by Assemblies marked a low for him. ""He could have criticised my decision. But he was personal in his criticism. That left a bad taste,"" the CJI said.Asked about the meagre representation of women in Supreme Court , the CJI said this is mainly on account of very few women judges at present finding a place among those in the zone of consideration. ""This is because the selection of women judges for HCs picked up late, and I'm sure that in another five years, there will be many women HC judges in the zone of consideration for elevation to the apex court.""Given the option to choose between the Collegium system and one akin to the quashed National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) which was put in place unanimously by Parliament, the CJI said the present system (Collegium) has worked well, especially since the Collegium started interacting with the recommended persons individually to test their suitability.On the pendency of more than five crore cases in trial courts, he said the strength of trial court judges (around 21,000 at present) needs to be increased in a phased yet continuous manner.Among the important judgments penned by him, the series of rulings that strengthened the protection of environment, ecology and forests are closest to his heart. The unanimous verdict in the Presidential Reference, the one for sub-categorisation of SC/STs and the striking down of Tribunal Reforms Act, all of which required long hours of deliberation, too figured among the favourite judgments of CJI Gavai.",CJI Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai is the second from Dalit community to head the judiciary.

IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

How the tragic mishap occurred?

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Afshan saluted her husband, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, as she paid her last respects to him.Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.The mortal remains of Wing Commander Namansh Syal were brought to his native village of Patialkar in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district on Sunday.Villagers, family members and officials gathered to pay emotional tributes as his last rites are set to be performed.The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the pilot’s demise after the aircraft crashed and burst into flames during a low-level aerobatic demonstration at Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai on Friday.Local residents and friends described Syal as a “gem” and the pride of their village and school.Sandeep Kumar, a local, said, “We are from the same village as Namansh, Patialkar. Everyone in our village is sad. He was like our younger brother. This should not have happened. We do not have words. We met him 3-4 months ago when he visited our village.”Pankaj Chadha, who studied alongside Wing Commander Namansh Syal, recalled their school days and how he was a gem.""I have also studied in the same school as Namansh, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira. We have lost one of our gems. He was the pride of our school. We will go to his native village, Patialkar. He made all of us very proud,"" Chadha said.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter jet was performing an eight-minute aerobatic demonstration when it could not recover from a low-altitude “negative G-turn,” plunging to the ground and erupting into flames in front of a large audience.Visuals from the Dubai Air Show showed the jet crashing and sending thick black smoke into the sky. Emergency teams rushed to the site, but Wing Commander Syal could not eject in time and sustained fatal injuries.This was the second crash involving the lightweight multi-role Tejas since its induction into the IAF a decade ago. The first crash, near Jaisalmer in March last year, saw the pilot safely eject. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the crash, coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the aircraft’s black box.Veteran pilots highlight that such accidents can occur due to sudden loss of power, control malfunction or spatial disorientation during negative G maneuvers","Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.

It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance.

Tragedy struck with brutal finality at the Dubai airshow when an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during a negative-G manoeuvre, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal and plunging the biennial spectacle into grief.Hours later, a heartfelt Instagram post from US F-16 demonstration pilot Taylor ""FEMA"" Hiester cut through the noise, emerging as a stark reminder of the bond that unites aviators across flags and frontiers.Hiester, a captain with US Air Force's Thunderbirds-inspired demo team, was prepping for his own routine when the Tejas went down and erupted in flames. His reflective post - shared with 150,000 followers - captured shock, sorrow and solidarity. He revealed that his team chose to withdraw from their final performance, a rare step in a world driven by tight schedules and multimillion-dollar deals.""Though the show made the shocking decision to continue with the flying schedule, our team along with a few others made the decision to cancel our final performance out of respect to the pilot, his colleagues and family,"" Hiester, 34, wrote.He described walking past the Tejas crew, motionless beside an ""empty parking spot"", ladder still on the ramp, the pilot's belongings untouched in his rental car.""I suppose each of us contemplated their new reality that came in an instant,"" he added - an image that distilled the dread every fighter pilot carries into the cockpit.As the airshow pressed ahead with upbeat announcements, Hiester felt uneasy. Crowds cheered, sponsors were thanked, and a closing line - ""Congratulations to all of our sponsors... we'll see you in 2027"" - clashed sharply with the grief still hanging over the tarmac. ""It was uncomfortable for me for a lot of reasons, some of them selfish,"" he wrote, imagining his own team breaking down their gear amid blaring music and carnival energy.That dissonance became a ""gift"": a reminder that beyond rockstar treatment and sponsor demands, what endures are the teammates who become family, he wrote.

NEW DELHI: After the decimation in Bihar, Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus, with the brass collectively slamming SIR on Sunday as an ""attempt to manipulate"" voters' lists, and packing the party schedule with protests. This has put in shade the demonstrations by Congress members in Patna who are accusing election managers of bungling ticket distribution, and the general dissenting voices seeking ""introspection"" on the defeat.On Sunday, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi slammed the ""hasty"" special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the wake of growing cases of deaths of BLOs.Rahul said, ""Chaos has been wrought upon the country in the name of SIR. Sixteen BLOs have lost their lives in three weeks. Heart attacks, stress, suicide - SIR is not a reform, it is an imposed oppression."" He said citizens were having to find their names in 22-year-old voter lists running into thousands of pages, and this was aimed at tiring out genuine voters into giving up so that ""vote chori"" continued unabated. ""This is not a failure, it is a conspiracy; democracy is being sacrificed to protect power,"" Rahul said.Kharge said the ""hasty SIR"" was reminiscent of unplanned ""demonetisation"" and ""lockdown"".Congress on Sunday directed its state units to observe upcoming ""samvidhan divas"" on Nov 26 as ""samvidhan bachao divas"" over SIR. Congress has already announced a mass rally in the capital on Dec 14 to mark the culmination of its nationwide ""signature campaign"" against ""vote chori"".Amid the unifocal agenda, the party has not moved to look at the Bihar election management after the massive defeat, an issue that is riling many within. Facing criticism are AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru and the state brass but also the main strategists. It is felt that concern over SIR can go along with a serious relook at how the party contests elections, which could pave the way for a rethink that helps Congress in the future.The fact that Congress lost at least four elections that it was expected to win in the last couple of years has caused unrest among many who were hoping for ""honest analysis"" in the wake of the performance in Bihar. ""How will we improve if we don't look at our mistakes,"" said a neta, who stated that airing dissenting opinions was not going to matter anymore.The review meeting held by the top brass the day after the Bihar results blamed ""electoral irregularities"" for the disastrous outcome - viewed as the reason why not many dissenting voices have come out barring those given in the immediate wake of the defeat. ""We don't think anyone at the AICC even took note of those demonstrations in Patna,"" a key party manager said.","Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus.

This trend of speaking in one voice, without any single judge taking credit for authoring the judgment, started with Ayodhya verdict. A five-judge bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi didn't have the author's name.For the last six months, Justice Narasimha, since he started presiding over benches, has also rendered judgments without taking authorship credit and passing the verdicts as that of the bench. However, his bench colleague has been persuaded to take credit for judgments authored by him.It is likely that Justice Narasimha could have suggested an unanimous yet anonymous opinion by the five-judge bench on the reference.In the presidential reference opinion, the five-judge bench explained why it did not want to be influenced by foreign judgments. The SC said, ""Copious written submissions and extensive arguments have been employed by counsel to underscore the functioning of the Westminster parliamentary model and its workings in the UK. They sought to draw parallels on the discretionary powers of the Crown and the limitations thereon. ""It added, ""This court believes that our constitutional truth does not lay in either of these extremes but is grounded in the way we have successfully, and if we may add, proudly, worked our Constitution over three quarters of a century. While our constitutional text may have been inspired by comparative outlook, its interpretation and working, we believe, is truly swadeshi.""It explained how the working of India's constitutional federal democracy was different from that of the UK and the US. ""Unlike the English experience of an unwritten constitution, we have a written text. English constitutional law did not have to grapple with vital questions of federalism and an inherently diverse country,"" it said.""The American experience is different due to the strict separation of powers between executive and legislature, necessitating the presidential veto. Indian constitutionalism has evolved to a parliamentary model where legislative agenda, business and enactment is overwhelmingly executed at the behest of the executive,"" it said.","CJI B R Gavai said the bench wanted to speak in one voice and support its opinion with'swadeshi' interpretation of constitutional provisions.

NEW DELHI: Government is looking at a technology-based solution to curb the growing menace of two-wheeler riders using mobile phone handsets while driving or performing stunts, which contribute to road crashes. The plan involves installing touch or pressure sensors on both handlebars of two-wheelers so that if the rider's hands are off the handle/s for more than 7-8 seconds, the vehicle would automatically begin to de-accelerate, forcing the person to ride properly.TOI has learned that the plan to use technology to correct rider behaviour was discussed at length at a meeting of transport ministry officials with vehicle manufacturers recently. Officials believe that such a mechanism could significantly reduce distracted riding, particularly the practice of holding a mobile phone in one hand while navigating traffic with the other, as well as performance of stunts.Many riders continue to flout basic safety norms despite penalties under the Motor Vehicles Act. ""If the vehicle itself can sense unsafe behaviour and respond, it will deter risky behaviour without requiring constant policing,"" said an official.Alongside handlebar sensors, manufacturers have been urged to explore the feasibility of providing leg guards on two-wheelers. This feature can reduce the severity of lower-limb injuries, which are among the most common in motorcycle crashes. While leg guards were more common in older models, modern two-wheelers do not have them.Government data shows there has been a steep rise in the number of two-wheeler deaths - from 69,385 in 2021 to 77,539 in 2023, nearly 45% of all road deaths. Two-wheeler riders top both as victims and cause of road fatalities. According to the road transport ministry's report, two-wheeler riders had the highest share of road deaths in 2023 while 48,181 people were killed in accidents caused by them.","The plan involves installing touch or pressure sensors on both handlebars of two-wheelers.

E-tailers fined for selling walkie talkies

NEW DELHI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a Rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in Patna for collecting service charge from a customer in violation of guidelines. The authority's order - monetary penalty, direction to refund service charge collected and instructions to immediately stop the practice - may serve as a reference point for similar consumer complaints in the future.This comes after the March 28 Delhi HC order which held that all restaurants must adhere to guidelines issued by CCPA on service charge. The court also made it clear that any violation of guidelines would invite appropriate action against erring establishments.CCPA in its guidelines issued on July 4, 2022, had specified that no hotel or restaurant will add service charge automatically or by default to the bill and that this should not be collected by adding it along with the food bill and GST on the total amount. Service charge is voluntary and this must be informed to customers.The instant case was taken up CCPA after Ravi Nandan Kumar filed a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline in April over Cafe Blue Bottle levying a service charge of Rs 801 in addition to GST.CCPA carried out an examination of the veracity of the claim since such a practice would have impacted a 'class' of customers.In response, the restaurant claimed that service charge was optional and that if a customer declines to pay, it is removed from the bill. It also submitted that a refund of Rs 591 would be made to the customer.An investigation found the restaurant had offered a credit note of Rs 591 (minus discount of Rs 210), without the customer's consent, which was ""not a valid substitute for monetary reimbursement"". The authority concluded that the restaurant used a software based bill generation system whereby service charge would have been automatically generated for all customers. It noted the restaurant didn't submit the number of bills with included service charge but removed or refunded subsequently to clear shadows of doubts.In two other orders, CCPA imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on Jiomart and Chimiya for selling walkie talkies without necessary disclosures. They have also been directed to remove advertisements and ensure that in future no product requiring statutory approval or certification is listed or sold on platforms without compliance of law.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a Rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in Patna for collecting service charge from a customer.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi sought a global compact to ensure AI is used for good and to prevent its misuse, saying this should be based on basic principles including effective human oversight, safety-by-design, transparency, and strict restrictions on the use of AI in deepfakes, crime and terror activities.To build a fair and just future for all, PM Modi said, India stood for development that is sustainable, trade that is trusted, finance that is fair, and progress in which everyone prospers. Citing the Covid-era global supply chain vulnerabilities, the PM underscored that nations cannot be viewed merely as markets, and must adopt a sensitive and long-term approach.""AI systems that impact human life, security, or public trust must be responsible and auditable.

NEW DELHI: Amid attempts to link the deaths or alleged suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs), particularly in West Bengal, to ""pressure"" of work related to the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, election-related officials pointed out that Phase-2 of the exercise was progressing at a much more relaxed pace than Phase-1, which was exclusive to Bihar.An officer said while the distribution of enumeration forms was completed in four days in Bihar, it stretched for 10 days in Phase-2 across 12 states and UTs. While states like West Bengal have seen a steady procession of alleged SIR-related suicides and complaints of work pressure, reports of some deaths have also been received from Gujarat, Rajasthan and MP.On the other hand, work is on seamlessly in other states/UTs. For instance, a differently-abled BLO in Rajasthan, Babulal, has already completed 100% digitisation of enumeration forms, as has woman BLO Jyoti Pawar in Madhya Pradesh's Nepanagar assembly constituency. Even reports from Left-led Kerala suggest good participation.Officers pointed out that the digitisation of enumeration forms in SIR's Phase-2 was, on an average, progressing at a comfortable pace, with each BLO completing around 50-60 forms a day.""Around 40% forms were digitised in the 10 days from Nov 14-23, and at this steady rate, the task looks achievable by the Dec 4 deadline. Besides, even if eligible electors do not show up in the draft list, they have time until Feb 7 to get added to the final roll,"" said the officer.The officer added that over 450 BLOs were suspended in Bihar for not doing their duty properly. ""But there were no suicides,"" he said.It may also do well to verify whether the BLOs are indeed being subjected to pressures that may be driving them to suicide or causing their deaths. ""It may possibly be related to other reasons, including political pressure, a health issue or family reasons. For instance, the suicide by a woman BLO in Nadia. Though the West Bengal chief electoral officer has sought a report from the district magistrate, the reason for death can only be established based on the postmortem report; in case a suicide or murder is confirmed, an FIR will follow,"" he said.""The suicide note will then be sent for forensic analysis to establish its authenticity. Calling it a suicide at this juncture is premature. Even if it does turn out to be death while discharging duty, the rules require the kin to be compensated,"" he said.","Election-related officials point out that Phase-2 of the exercise was progressing at a much more relaxed pace than Phase-1.

After that, a new chapter begins,"" he said.BR Gavai is the 52nd Chief Justice, the first Buddhist and second Dalit to head the Supreme Court after KG Balakrishnan.Addressing the issue of the ""creamy layer"" within caste-based reservations, CJI Gavai said the Supreme Court has ""done its part,"" but it is now up to the government and Parliament to implement changes to ensure that benefits reach the truly marginalised sections.Last year, as part of a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court approved subclassification within scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, a move aimed at preventing the creation of a ""class within a class"" in reservation benefits.Justice Gavai, who was part of the bench for that judgment, emphasised that equality must permeate through all levels and cautioned against the continued misuse of reservations by families that have already progressed socioeconomically.""We have seen many Scheduled Caste families prosper, yet they still avail reservation benefits,"" he said, pointing out cases where children of SC/ST IAS officers seek quota-based advantages.In his judgment, he wrote, ""The State must formulate a policy to identify the creamy layer among SC/ST categories and exclude them from affirmative action. This is the only way to achieve true equality.""Chief Justice Gavai, who retires tomorrow, remains a significant figure as only the second Dalit to lead India’s highest judicial body. His reflections highlight ongoing challenges in implementing caste-based reservation reforms effectively.","BR Gavai is the 52nd Chief Justice, the first Buddhist and second Dalit to head the Supreme Court after KG Balakrishnan.

NEW DELHI: Millions of citizens going online will have guaranteed control over their digital data while social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram will need verifiable parental consent before onboarding children, or those under 18 years, with the govt finally notifying rules to operationalise the digital personal data protection (DPDP) law that was originally passed by Parliament in Aug 2023.The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, ecommerce, gaming, banking, payments, and for availing govt services.Companies and organisations violating the rules will face penalties, up to Rs 250cr for serious failures to protect data and breaches.The rules also require companies to quickly inform users and the new data protection board about any data breach. However, these rules will be implemented gradually.The govt has given an 18-month window to companies for transition, considering the big backend changes they will need to undertake. Any breach must be promptly informed in “plain language, explaining the nature and possible consequences of the breach, the steps taken to address it and contact details for assistance”, the govt said.It also said the law is guided by “seven core principles” -- consent and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, security safeguards, and accountability.Regarding online data of children, where Big Tech and other major companies had been lobbying for a “liberal” approach, the new law mandates that companies must obtain verifiable consent before processing their personal data, with limited exemptions for essential purposes such as healthcare, education and real-time safety. “For persons with disabilities who cannot make legal decisions even with support, consent must come from a lawful guardian verified under applicable laws. ”To obtain verifiable parental consent for onboarding and processing a child’s personal data, companies must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent children from accessing services by faking their age or guardians. The rules state that companies need to “observe due diligence, for checking that the individual identifying herself as the parent is an adult who is identifiable if required in connection with compliance with any law”.The new rules also have provisions that allow the govt to restrict transfer of certain data outside the country, which is likely to be a worry for tech giants such as Meta, Google, and Amazon.“A Significant Data Fiduciary shall undertake measures to ensure that personal data specified by the central govt, on the basis of the recommendations of a committee constituted by it, is processed subject to the restriction that the personal data and the traffic data pertaining to its flow is not transferred outside the territory of India,” the rules say, without giving any further details. The committee will be constituted by the central govt and will include officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Technology, apart from other departments and ministries.And, to strengthen the rights of online users, the new law gives the right to individuals to “access, correct, update or erase their personal data” and even nominate another person to exercise these rights on their behalf. “Data Fiduciaries must respond to all such requests within a maximum of 90 days.”For transparency and accountability, companies will need to display contact information — such as that of a designated officer or Data Protection Officer — to let individuals raise queries about personal data processing. Also, companies with a large number of users will have enhanced obligations, including independent audits, impact assessments and stronger due diligence for deployed technologies. “They must also comply with govt-specified restrictions on certain categories of data, including localisation where required. ”The law now paves the way for formation of a Data Protection Board that will function as a fully digital institution, enabling citizens to file and track complaints online through a dedicated platform and mobile app. “Appeals against its decisions will lie with the Appellate Tribunal, TDSAT.”","The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, ecommerce, gaming, banking, payments, and for availing govt services.

NEW DELHI: With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products such as aata, maida and sooji after a gap of nearly three-and-a-half years. In a letter to the commerce department, it has suggested considering allowing such exports of up to one million tonne (MT).Referring to the representation of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation of India to allow export of wheat products based on the “prevailing surplus and strong production outlook”, the ministry has sought “necessary action”.Sources said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) commenced the open market sale scheme (OMSS) of wheat for bulk buyers such as flour millers and this got a lukewarm response with around 70,000 tonne sold through e-action against the offer 2 lakh tonnes at Rs 2,550 per quintal. They added that this indicates enough wheat availability in the market and even the wholesale prices have dropped by around 12% compared to last year.At present, FCI has around 30.5 MT of wheat stock against the buffer requirement of 20.5 MT for Jan 1, 2026.Navneet Chitlangia, president of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation, said India has witnessed a bumper wheat harvest this season, and with a favourable monsoon, they anticipate yet another excellent harvest in the coming season.“In view of the robust domestic production, we have requested govt to lift the restrictions on wheat product exports so that India may reclaim its traditional markets across the globe,” he said.Before the export ban of wheat products, India used to send shipments of flour, maida and sooji and other products to Africa, Gulf and south Asian countries. In May, a ban was imposed on exports of wheat and its products due to concerns over domestic food security, drop in production, and rising inflation.","With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products.

‘Bihar’s New MY Formula Is Mahila & Youth’: PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress After NDA’s Landslide Win

NEW DELHI: The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar polls with the highest turnout ever, particularly after the first special intensive revision (SIR) of its electoral roll in over two decades, is set to boost the confidence of Election Commission as it goes about Phase 2 of SIR across a dozen states and Union territories, including those due for assembly polls next.The overwhelming participation of electors first in SIR and then in Bihar polls is seen as a clear indication that the ‘vote chori’ campaign of the Opposition, led by the Congress and amplified by Rahul Gandhi through his ‘vote adhikar’ yatra in the state, press conferences and even personal attacks against the chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, did not find resonance with the public. The assessment is reinforced by the Congress's modest six-seat tally.Even the Supreme Court had refused to entertain the opposition parties’ and activists’ pleas to stay and quash SIR in Bihar, based on their fear that it would disenfranchise electors from weaker sections and minorities. Of course, the high participation of these very sections in the Bihar poll, has demolished their argument. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in his victory speech on Friday, said the high voting in Bihar, particularly by the weaker sections, is a big achievement of the EC, as is the elimination of repolls that were synonymous with elections during the ‘jungle raj’ era.He recalled how voting in Naxalism-hit polling stations was earlier wound up at 3 PM over security concerns. This time, he said, electors voted overwhelmingly and fearlessly, erasing old memories of ballot boxes being looted.“I congratulate the EC, poll-related officers, security forces and electors for this,” said Modi. Importantly, he underlined that the electors of Bihar, particularly the youth, had shown that they take SIR with utmost seriousness. “For purity of democracy, every vote matters,” he said while exhorting the party apparatus at the polling station level to contribute 100% to SIR in other places.Speaking to TOI, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said: “The zero appeals against the final electoral roll of Bihar, not a single request for repoll from the 2,616 candidates or 12 recognised parties and the highest polling since Bihar’s first election in 1951, show the precision and commitment with which EC and its ground machinery have worked to deliver a free, fair and peaceful election. This, for EC, is the biggest validation”.Kumar was personally targeted in comments by Rahul Gandhi and AI-generated campaigns on Congress’s social media handles, both over SIR and alleged roll irregularities in long-gone elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana. Yet, displaying tenacity, EC countered each attack with facts and cited the relevant provisions of law validating its actions and directions. Transparency at each stage of SIR -- enumeration, claims and objections and their disposal -- with daily bulletins and fact-checks ensured a direct line with the electors who willingly participated in SIR and ensured that all deadlines were met.","The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar polls with the highest turnout ever is set to boost the confidence of Election Commission.

Bihar election 2025: How BJP's numbers gain cushions it against another Nitish deal with MGB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-2025-how-bjps-numbers-gain-cushions-it-against-another-nitish-deal-with-mgb/articleshow/125340443.cms,"Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA's massive win in Bihar has placed BJP in a sweet spot as seat shares of different parties, across the political spectrum, have virtually cushioned it against political exigencies which have bedevilled it in the past.Though BJP and JDU have bonded well since CM Nitish Kumar returned to NDA in Jan 2024 and has vowed to never join hands with RJD again, the decimation of Lalu Prasad's party has ensured any such future prospect is hardly a guarantee for a new govt.RJD's tally of 25, six of Congress and JDU's 85 MLAs together falls short of the majority mark of 122 - a feat that was achievable after the 2020 elections when Nitish decided to dump BJP.A consolidation of the entire Mahagathbandhan with JDU will reach the 120 mark and will require the support of AIMIM's five MLAs to cross the magic number, an uncertain scenario as it includes parties with one or two MLAs and six of Congress, which has a history of legislators breaking ranks in the state.With BJP emerging as the single-largest party for the first time in Bihar after an assembly poll - it had achieved the distinction in the outgoing assembly after bypolls and joining by MLAs of Vikassheel Insaan Party - with 89 seats, the party can hope to spurn any bid to oust him from power, a fate it has suffered twice as Nitish switched between alliances.While the Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has won 19 seats, has been firmly by BJP's side, two other NDA partners, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcham, have increasingly hewed closer to BJP even though both were once in JDU.HAM and RLM have won five and four seats, respectively. BJP with its three other allies outside JDU will have the support 117 MLAs and depend upon support from six more lawmakers to get a majority, if such an eventuality arises.The numbers have also ensured that no non-JDU ally is in a position to push BJP, or is left with much leverage to get its demand met.Paswan in the past has at times flexed muscle in seat-sharing talks or tried to take a line different from BJP on key political issues, a tactic often resented by the BJP brass.Manjhi like Paswan has always been vocal in endorsing PM Narendra Modi but is seen a mercurial ally. Both are also cabinet ministers at the Centre. With Lok Sabha elections due in 2029 and assembly polls over, it is unlikely that any of these allies will venture to disturb the governing coalition.There is a view that BJP may also induct Kushwaha as a minister in the central govt or make his wife, who has won as an MLA, a minister in the state govt to ensure that all its allies are suitable rewarded.BJD had hit a similar enviable zone following the Maharashtra assembly polls where NDA received a sweeping mandate as it has now in Bihar. In the 288-member House, BJP won 132 seats, reducing its dependability on allies significantly. It ensured its decision to replace Sena politician Eknath Shinde with its neta Devendra Fadnavis as CM was executed without any major hiccup.In Bihar, BJP has asserted NDA was fighting the election under Nitish's leadership and that there was no vacancy for the top post, while stopping short of declaring himself as its chief ministerial face. However, his continuation is seen as most likely.","NDA's massive win in Bihar has placed BJP in a sweet spot as seat shares of different parties, across the political spectrum, have virtually cushioned it.

NEW DELHI: Leading BJP's celebrations over the party's impressive performance in Bihar, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said the state's people have given a befitting reply to the ""divisive M-Y (Muslim-Yadav)"" with another 'M-Y' (Mahila-Youth), a constructive and positive combine, to thwart the return of ""Jungle-Raj"".""This victory has given a new positive meaning to the 'M-Y', that is 'Mahila and Youth'. Bihar has the highest youth population belonging to all castes and religions. Their wishes, aspirations and dreams have destroyed the communal 'M-Y' formula of 'Jungle Raj',"" Modi said in his address to BJP workers in victory celebrations at the party headquarters here.Waving a ""gamcha"" to greet BJP workers, Modi chanted 'Chhathi Maiya ki Jai' and also used the Bhojpuri lingo 'garda uda diya', meaning the people of Bihar, with this massive victory and their unshakable confidence, have taken the state by storm.Doubling down the attack on Congress, the PM coined a new term, 'MMC' for the opposition party, saying it has become ""Muslim League Maoist Congress"", a remark reflecting concerns within Congress too as Sonia Gandhi, after the 2014 Lok Sabha poll loss, had attributed her party's defeat for being identified as ""pro-Muslim"". ""Today's Congress has become a Muslim League Maoist Congress (MMC), its entire agenda is run only on this,"" Modi said.The PM said Congress is headed for another split as a large section of the party is unhappy with the ""agenda"" of ""Namdaar"" (Rahul Gandhi), and they are set to part ways. He said even Congress's allies are beginning to understand that Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. ""That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the 'naamdar' of Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond,"" he said.Modi hailed the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and the contribution of all NDA leaders, including Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha.","Bihar's people have given a befitting reply to the ""divisive M-Y (Muslim- Yadav),"" PM Narendra Modi said.

NEW DELHI: In Lakhisarai, BJP’s Vijay Kumar Sinha has secured victory with 1,22,408 votes, defeating INC’s Amaresh Kumar, who finished with 97,468 votes, while Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar trailed behind with 8,722 votes.Lakhisarai Assembly constituency, situated in Lakhisarai district, is among Bihar’s 243 seats and falls under the Munger Lok Sabha constituency.

Independent contenders also made their presence felt — Sujeet Kumar secured 11,570 votes, while Fulena Singh got 10,938. Out of 3,68,106 registered electors, 1,94,289 votes were declared valid.Sinha had earlier won in 2015 as well, bagging 75,901 votes (40.8 per cent) against JD(U)’s Ramanand Mandal, who garnered 69,345 votes (37.3 per cent), marking a narrow margin of 6,556.The constituency’s voting history reflects tight contests, though the BJP has managed to hold the seat for consecutive terms.Polling has concluded and the fate of the candidates is now sealed in the electronic voting machines.A poll of polls released on Tuesday suggested that the NDA is likely to return to power with around 148 seats. The RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, despite campaigning on a platform of change, is projected to finish with around 88 seats, while other parties may secure about 7 seats.People’s Pulse estimated 133–159 seats for the NDA, 75–101 for the Mahagathbandhan, 0–5 for Jan Suraaj, and 2–8 for others.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.

Nitish Does It Again: Alliance Back With Landmark 202 Seats

PATNA: National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a stunning landslide in Bihar, with the governing coalition headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar bagging 202 of 243 assembly seats in a hugely one-sided outcome that underscores the JDU boss's political resilience despite two decades in office, and PM Narendra Modi's sway over voters, while deflating the Grand Alliance's Rahul Gandhi-led campaign against ""vote theft"".The overwhelming victory puts BJP on a firm footing ahead of approaching encounters, especially in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.The outcome, which surpassed NDA's own expectations, is seen as a pro-incumbency vote conveying gratitude to Nitish Kumar, who put the state back on track after a widely perceived 15 years of anarchy, and marks a ""coming of age"" moment for women voters who turned out in huge numbers to reciprocate Nitish-led NDA govt's measures to empower them using a whole spectrum of means. It also speaks to the success of a strategy to overpower the numerically robust Muslim-Yadav combination with a broader tent covering ""most backward classes"", ""non-Yadav backwards"", extremely backward classes, and significant sections of Dalits.It was the first time that women - including possibly those from the Yadav community - in a supposedly ""socially backward"" state made themselves felt as an independent electoral category.The landslide should potentially put Nitish Kumar on the way to becoming one of India's longest-serving CMs.Bihar voters disregarded concerns about CM Nitish Kumar's health and past political flip-flops to vote overwhelmingly for him. JDU's score of 85, which would have looked improbable after the underwhelming 43 it managed five years ago, was facilitated also by perfect coordination with BJP.BJP, fuelled by Modi's popularity in the state, has for the first time emerged as the single largest party in the state, an achievement that may encourage many in the party to stake claim to the chief ministership. BJP was also the glue for the coalition.Other members of the NDA alliance - Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, Union minister Jitanram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM - contributed to the thumping win with spectacular strike rates.In contrast, the rival RJD-led Mahagathbandhan fared poorly. The Tejashwi-led RJD barely escaped the political ignominy of slumping below its poorest score of 22, which it had crashed to in 2010. Congress, in keeping with what has become a pattern, again fared disastrously, plumbing to an embarrassing single-digit score of 6. CPI-ML's streak of successes since 2020 also came to a halt, with the leftist formation winning 2.Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has secured 5 seats, but the significance of its success stretches beyond the numbers in that it reflects a yearning among Muslims to diversity options beyond ""secular"" options led by non-Muslims.The coronation of Tejashwi, a CM-in-waiting for five years now, has been further delayed. He now must contend with the risk of BJP making overtures to Yadavs, with RJD having been out of govt for almost 20 years now. Nitish has never dropped his attempt to claim the Muslim vote and may redouble his efforts.In terms of national politics, the Gandhi-led Congress is the bigger loser, with his ""vote theft"" claim not getting any traction with Bihar voters. Congress responded to the shock by sticking to its guns. But it may come under pressure from within to revisit the drawing board.The biggest letdown, however, was Prashant Kishor, whose Jan Suraaj Party drew a blank, proving yet again that a successful career in political consultancy does not automatically translate into one's own political success.","National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a stunning landslide in Bihar.

NEW DELHI: Seven people were killed and several others were injured in a powerful accidental explosion at the Nowgam police station on the outskirts of Srinagar According to officials, the blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from Faridabad, part of the 2,900 kg chemical cache recovered from an arrested doctor in the case.The explosion caused successive smaller blasts and damaged the police station.The explosion happened late Friday night during sampling of explosives stored at the Nowgam police station, the primary station handling the Faridabad terror module case. The police officials have said whether the blast was pre-planned or accidental will be determined in further investigation.Over two dozen injured, mostly police personnelAt least 27 people — including 24 police personnel and three civilians — were injured, many of whom are undergoing treatment in Srinagar hospitals for burn injuries and blast trauma. Officials said the explosion is linked to the same chain of events that led to the unravelling of a major terror module.The explosive material being examined had been transported from Faridabad, Haryana. It was part of the cache seized during the investigation into the white-collar terror module. The seized explosives, had exposed a “white-collar terror module” linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind operating across Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.Investigators had earlier seized 360 kg of chemicals — ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sulphur and other materials — from a rented residence linked to arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie. Approximately 3,000 kilograms of explosives and bomb-making equipment stored by this module was also seized.The midnight blast shattered windows, damaged the station structure and disrupted the quiet of the neighbourhood as ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the site.The terror module came under the police radar when posters threatening security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. This prompted Srinagar Police to register a case on October 19.Frame-by-frame scrutiny of CCTV footage helped identify three suspects — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid. All three had past stone-pelting cases and were seen pasting the posters.Interrogation of the trio led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian. According to PTI, he allegedly supplied the posters and radicalised young doctors by leveraging his access to the medical community.The trail then led investigators to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested. The massive explosive haul was seized there.Police believe the core of the module consisted of three doctors: Dr Muzammil Ganaie,Dr Umar Nabi, Dr Muzzaffar Rather. A fourth doctor, Dr Adeel Rather, was arrested separately after an AK-56 rifle was recovered from him. His role is under investigation.The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least 13 people. According to CCTV footage, the car in which the Red Fort explosion occurred was being driven by Umar, a member of this module. According to agency sources, Umar fled as he panicked by the successful crackdown of security forces and his anxiety and desperation likely led to the explosion near Red Fort.(With agency inputs)","Blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from Faridabad.

NEW DELHI: Nine people were killed and several others sustained injuries after an explosion at the Nowgam police station in the outskirts of Srinagar.According to PTI, the blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives recently seized in connection with the 'white-collar' terror module case.The material had been brought from Faridabad, Haryana, and was part of the 360 kg of explosive chemicals recovered from the rented residence of arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie, officials said, PTI reported.The bodies have been shifted to the Police Control Room in Srinagar. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians have been admitted to various hospitals across the city, the officials said.Five of the injured are in critical condition, and officials warned that the toll may rise.The massive explosion shattered the quiet of the night and caused significant damage to the police station building. Ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the scene, with sirens piercing the air as the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.Small successive explosions after the initial blast briefly delayed rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad. While some of the seized explosives are stored at the police forensic lab, officials said the bulk of the 360 kg cache was being kept at the Nowgam police station, where the primary case linked to the terror module is registered.The terror module was uncovered after threatening posters targeting police and security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. Srinagar Police registered a case on October 19 and formed a special team to investigate.A detailed CCTV analysis led to the arrest of Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, all previously booked in stone-pelting cases—who were seen pasting the posters.Their interrogation pointed to Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian, accused of supplying the posters and radicalising the doctors.The probe eventually led police to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested, and where investigators seized the 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Earlier this week, a powerful blast ripped through a Hyundai i20 near Delhi’s Red Fort, leaving at least 13 dead and several others injured.","The blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives.

NDA's three-fourth majority in the third most populous state, its best performance since 2010, comes as a major endorsement of the 'double-engine plank' of the alliance and has validated the coalition's belief that an opposition campaign centred on targeting PM Narendra Modi carries a stiff cost.The coalition contested the polls as a united family, blurring the 'symbols divide', with smaller allies making significant contributions. Buoyed by the emphatic win despite the Mahagathbandhan's bitter campaign accusing PM Modi of 'vote chori', BJP strategists said the attack backfired - much like the 'chowkidar chor hai' slogan of 2019.A senior party functionary added that the fourth successive win in state elections points to the desire of the electorate to help Modi make up for the surprising sub-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. NDA's landslide victory, with BJP's second-best performance and strike rate ever, confirm that the charisma of Modi, the alliance mascot who has completed 11 years in office, remains intact.NDA's previous best tally was 206 of the 243 seats in 2010, with JDU winning 115 and BJ. This time, BJP has emerged as the single largest party. However, party leaders have shown commitment to abide by 'coalition dharma' and reconcile with the continuation of Nitish Kumar as CM - another testament to the fact that stitching alliances is not enough; parties must equally focus on running them smoothly.Unity among allies was so evident that even their poll offices were set up as those of the alliance, not individual parties.Besides, most rallies were held in the name of the alliance, with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah addressing workers of all parties rather than confining themselves to BJP or its bastions.Although Nitish Kumar had walked away from the alliance in the past, top BJP netas, including PM Modi and Shah, set the narrative for his entire 20 years in office, floating the slogan of 'Mangal Raj' as contrast to Lalu-Rabri's 'Jungle-Raj'. Central and state welfare schemes - particularly those benefitting women - formed the campaign's core, while reminders of the 'dark years' of misgovernance helped consolidate voter sentiment. BJP netas also accepted Nitish as the alliance leader, ignoring apprehensions about the chief minister's health.The PM addressed 13 rallies and held a roadshow in Patna. Throughout the campaign, he conveyed a message of unity to NDA constituents by interacting with them as the campaign kicked off and ironing out differences among them after the announcement of the alliance's candidates.","NDA's three-fourth majority in the third most populous state, its best performance since 2010, comes as a major endorsement of the 'double-engine plank' of the alliance.

This Kishor can’t sing: Bihar tunes out PKNEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps. His most anticipated script has, however, turned out to be a spectacular dud.When he started his public outreach in Bihar with a padyatra from Champaran three years ago, he dominated headlines because of his communication skills that mixed cocky predictions with unconventionally sharp attacks on regional satraps. He promised to deliver the state from the woes of unemployment and unceasing 'palayan' (migration).What added to his appeal was that he had worked with leading politicians, including PM Narendra Modi, and a host of regional heavyweights, such as CMs like Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee, during some of their successful electoral battles. A trailblazer as poll strategist, his successes made waves while failures like the one in UP assembly polls in 2017 did not diminish his image.Unlike most election strategists who prefer the backroom and keep a low profile, he never shied away from offering punditry and denouncing politicians who he believed were not charitable to him, Rahul Gandhi being a famous example after talks of his joining Congress fell through.Some of his predictions, like BJP failing to cross 100 seats in West Bengal in 2021, proved correct and some others missed the mark. But his profile grew, leading to a sense of anticipation before his Jan Suraaj Party's debut in Bihar. His meetings and roadshows drew crowds and his interviews were much sought after.As the dust kicked up by NDA's tsunami settles in Bihar, Kishor and his ambition lie buried. He had claimed that Nitish, whose party he had joined in 2018 with much fanfare before being expelled in 2020 for publicly scorning him for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, will not be the next CM and his party, JDU, will not win more than 25 seats. As of 10.30pm, JDU had won 85 seats and Nitish is expected to be sworn in again.Kishor's assertion that he will quit politics if this were to happen may come back to haunt him. As a political strategist, he has lost his sheen.However, the annihilation of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has also opened a narrow path for his unconventional politics that has so far shunned caste calculations and prioritised issues of universal public good like education and employment.","Prashant Kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Before these polls, Chirag Paswan had described himself as ""sabji mein namak"" (salt in vegetables), which is essential to any political broth.Winning 19 of the 29 seats his party contested, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief proved his mettle again in Bihar as his performance propelled NDA past the 200-seat mark. What makes the showing more significant is that LJP (RV) has wrested 17 seats from Mahagathbandhan despite talk of discontent around candidate selection.Chirag's rise in Bihar became evident during seat-sharing talks, when his party got a fair share despite only one of its 143 candidates winning during the 2020 assembly polls. His bargaining power came from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when LJP(RV) won all five seats it fought.At a time when the fortunes of other Dalit netas like Mayawati and Jitan Ram Manjhi have been on the decline, the son of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has emer-ged a prominent face. The victory has also virtually put an end to the claim his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras laid to Paswan senior's legacy. Though Paras has been claiming that his Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party is part of NDA, the coalition gave a clear signal when it did not give him a single seat.Before his political plunge, Chirag made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with 'Miley Naa Miley Hum', starring with Kangana Ranaut.

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI/PATNA: When Nitish appeared vulnerable, Didis rallied around.That women voters in Bihar are partial to Nitish Kumar-led NDA govt for its pro-women policies since 2005 is well known. What acted as a turbo-boost this time was the cash transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.5 crore women in poll season. As if Rakhi after Diwali, the 'das-hazariya' beneficiaries and Jeevika Didis turned out to be the catalyst in NDA's massive win.Women whose lives have changed on the back of govt policies are in substantial numbers - and they cut across caste lines.Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time - up from 59.7% in 2020. It was seen as an endorsement of NDA govt and a 'no' to MGB's return bid. An entire generation of women has benefitted from welfare programmes of the JDU-BJP govt, starting with the free cycle scheme for schoolgoing girls in its first term (2005-10). The sight of smiling girls cycling to school was the defining picture of Nitish's win in 2010, when the RJD-led opposition's decimation was as total as it is now.Even prohibition, with its flaws, draws strong support from women, especially the poor.Journalists travelling through Bihar often came cross the contrasting picture of men trashing the govt for its ""ineffective"" ban on liquor and their wives praising its benefits despite issues with implementation.Then there have been pioneering policies like 35% reservation for women in govt jobs and 50% in local bodies.Jeevika Didis, women members registered with more than 11 lakh self-help groups, also emerged as loyal supporters of Nitish govt.When TOI sought to gauge the mood of Jeevika Didis and other women across the state, a majority of them had expressed support for Nitish and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also, the relative safety under NDA govt has its share of admirers among women. Hooliganism was part of citizens' everyday experience under RJD govt ftom 1990 and 2005, and kept women in an almost permanent state of apprehension.The Nitish administration earned credit for making Bihar a safer place.Crime does occur, but not many citizens believe that the govt is deliberately soft on criminals - a charge that has stuck with the RJD so strongly that it cannot shake it off despite two decades out of office.Add to these the welfare schemes of Modi govt, especially free ration that ensures women running the kitchen of poor households don't have to worry about their families getting two meals a day. Despite his recent goof-ups in public, Nitish continues to be seen as an avuncular figure who cares for women. And women repay in faith.","Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time - up from 59.7% in 2020.

NEW DELHI: It may be the first time in three decades that RJD doesn't have a single member in Rajya Sabha when the next Bihar assembly elections come around in 2030.The party now has five members in the upper house, but it will gradually lose these seats even if a non-NDA party - like AIMIM with five MLAs in the new Bihar assembly - supports it in Rajya Sabha elections in 2026 and 2028.In 2030, RJD may retain one of its seats if it gets AIMIM support. But it appears a distant possibility as smaller parties invariably go by the politics of the day and their own interests.Out of five RJD members in Rajya Sabha, two - Prem Chand Gupta, the party's leader in the House, and A D Singh - will retire in April 2026. The third one, Faiyaz Ahmad, will retire in July 2028; and the remaining two, Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, will complete their term in April 2030.In 2026, elections will be held for five vacancies, including two from JDU and another from Rashtriya Lok Morcha (both NDA allies). The strength of the new assembly will help NDA gain all five seats from Bihar next year.Similarly, five members - three from BJP, and one each from JDU and RJD - will retire in 2028.

Around a dozen houses in the vicinity suffered some damage, residents alleged.J&K CM Omar Abdullah warned that ""such actions"" would only fuel anger.

Mass detentions, coercive interrogations and illegal demolitions will not bring peace; they will drag Kashmir back by decades,"" he warned.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said the govt must act strictly against the perpetrators of terror attacks instead of their families.

Flawless seat-sharing formula

Resurrecting 'Jungle Raj' scare

Broadened caste coalition

Massive women voter mobilisation & welfare outreach

Nitish factor & JD(U) resurgence

The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) seems set to secure a historic win in Bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure a whopping 203 seats in the 243-seat assembly, with the BJP posting its best performance since 2010.The 2025 polls unfolded against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted campaign focused on stability, development, and inclusivity, where the NDA's narrative of 'double-engine government' under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar resonated powerfully with the voters.This election saw historic voter participation, with women and young voters emerging as vital pillars of support for the NDA, reflecting a sustained engagement with grassroots welfare schemes and effective mobilisation efforts.At the heart of this electoral juggernaut was not just robust governance but also impeccable political engineering — from flawless seat sharing among alliance partners to resurrecting deep-rooted fears about past lawlessness encapsulated in the widely known 'Jungle Raj' scare. The alliance's success was further amplified by broadening caste coalitions beyond traditional alignments, disrupting longstanding vote banks, and capitalising on the enduring Nitish Kumar factor, which brought JD(U) back to a dominant position within the coalition.The NDA's decisive victory in Bihar in 2025 was strongly supported by a meticulously crafted seat-sharing formula, finalised well before the polls.The alliance comprised BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), HAM(S) and RLM.The BJP and JD(U) evenly contested 101 seats each, a historic power parity indicating maturity within the NDA.Smaller allies like the LJP (Ram Vilas) contested 29 seats, while HAM(S) settled for six seats despite initial demands for 15.This seat sharing was achieved in a ""cordial atmosphere"" with all partners conceding to key demands to avoid intra-alliance friction, a frequent issue in multi-party coalitions.What differentiated the 2025 elections was the emphasis on quality seats rather than sheer numbers, ensuring that each party contested constituencies where they had strong grassroots presence and electoral appeal.This precision in allotment minimised vote-splitting and maximised coalition coherence. Leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi openly declared unwavering support for PM Modi and the alliance, projecting unity. The arrangement allowed the NDA to mobilise resources and campaign effectively across the caste and regional spectrum.This flawless seat-sharing was a critical structural factor, removing the pitfalls of previous elections where seat disputes diluted NDA's strength. In a hyper-competitive environment like Bihar, the seat sharing formula was a linchpin in translating vote shares into seat tallies, ensuring the NDA's electoral machinery was uninterrupted and optimally functioning to deliver a record majority.Also read: Women, welfare and the ‘phoenix’ CM: How Nitish-led NDA crushed MGB in Bihar elections - 10 key takeaways In its campaign, the BJP-led NDA capitalised heavily on resurrecting the fear of 'Jungle Raj', a term associated with lawlessness during the Lalu-Rabri era (1990-2005).This narrative was revived through incidents like the attack on deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha's convoy, which was framed as politically motivated intimidation by ""goons"" aligned with the opposition RJD.This law-and-order scare reminded voters of the chaotic and violent past under RJD's regime, contrasting it with the NDA’s promise of stability and governance.Despite Bihar witnessing its most peaceful elections ever with zero repolls or violent incidents — a dramatic turnaround from previous decades — the Jungle Raj rhetoric struck a chord with many voters wary of instability.The NDA portrayed itself as the only viable safeguard against a return to 'goon raj', appealing to citizens’ desire for security and development.This fear narrative was strategically blended with reminders of the NDA's development agenda, juxtaposing past lawlessness with the promise of infrastructural progress and industrial investment under PM Modi and Nitish Kumar. Consequently, this scare tactic mobilised a wide voter base, particularly those who had lived through or remembered the earlier turbulence, reinforcing voter preference for the NDA coalition.One of the pivotal reasons for the NDA's landslide was its expanded caste coalition that transcended previous rigid caste alignments. Historically, Bihar politics hinged on the Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, which benefited the RJD.However, in 2025, a new arithmetic emerged emphasising mahila (women) and EBC (Economically Backward Classes) groups, creating a ‘ME’ factor that substantially boosted NDA’s vote share.NDA consolidated the upper castes through BJP, while Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) secured a strong base among Kurmis and EBCs, which constitute about 36% of Bihar’s population. Additionally, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya Lok Morcha, and Hindustani Awam Morcha augmented the NDA’s Dalit and backward caste appeal, creating a broad and diverse coalition that cut across traditional lines.This strategy diluted the RJD’s reliance on a narrow caste bloc by integrating multiple caste groups and regenerating old alliances with renewed welfare outreach targeting EBCs and Dalits. The coalition’s inclusivity paved the way for securing nearly 49% of the vote against the Mahagathbandhan's 38%.Women played a decisive role in the NDA’s electoral sweep, with historic voter turnout gaps revealing women voted 10-20 percentage points higher than men in many districts such as Supaul, Kishanganj, and Madhubani.The Election Commission’s deployment of over 1.8 lakh Jeevika Didis — women volunteers guiding other women voters regarding booth locations and voting processes — significantly improved electoral participation among women and first-time young voters.NDA’s extensive welfare programs targeting women, including schemes for self-help groups, livelihood support, and social security, energised this vital demographic. The Nitish government's efforts to empower women, coupled with BJP’s national outreach, resonated deeply with female voters who perceived the NDA as a champion of their aspirations and safety.This mobilisation was complemented by adding more than 14 lakh new young voters, many women, expanding NDA’s voter base. The enhanced women voter turnout created a crucial margin that decisively contributed to the NDA’s overwhelming victory.Nitish Kumar’s enduring appeal and the resurgence of JD(U) significantly influenced the NDA’s 2025 triumph.Despite concerns over his age and governance challenges, Nitish remains Bihar’s most trusted political figure, often perceived as synonymous with good governance and development.The slogan ""Bihar Ka Matlab Nitish Kumar"" and ""Tiger abhi zinda hai"" resonated widely, cementing his centrality in voter perception.JD(U)'s comeback was marked by its strategic equal seat-sharing with the BJP, signaling strengthened confidence and relevance in Bihar politics despite BJP’s growing national role within the NDA. Nitish’s governance record on infrastructure and welfare, combined with his image as a stable leader capable of balancing Bihar's complex caste equations, reinforced voter trust.The synergy between Nitish’s JD(U) and BJP under the NDA created a unified front that could appeal to diverse electoral groups, blending Nitish's Kurmi and EBC support with BJP’s upper caste and youth outreach.","The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) seems set to secure a historic win in Bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure 203 seats. The 2025 polls unfolded against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted campaign focused on stability, development, and inclusivity. At the heart of this electoral juggernaut was not just robust governance but also impeccable political engineering.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125323694,imgsize-76628,width-400,resizemode-4/nda2.jpg"

LJP (RV)'s previous performances

Chirag vs Tejashwi in 2030?

NEW DELHI: The two senior Bihar NDA constituents — the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) — may have swept the assembly elections between themselves. But it was Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which brought in the extra seats and powered the coalition’s march beyond the 200-seat mark.Though the counting of votes is still underway and results are still being declared, the LJP (RV) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies. If it wins all those seats, it would end with a strike rate of 68 per cent and would have a won a whopping 1800 per cent more seats than in 2020.The NDA’s decision to allocate 29 constituencies to the LJP (Ram Vilas) had drawn attention — and some unease — within the alliance. The two smaller partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLP), were each given six seats to contest.The LJP (RV) was allotted the following assembly constituencies: Govindganj, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Darauli, Garkha, Sahebpur Kamal, Bakhri, Parbatta, Nathnagar, Paliganj, Brahmapur, Dehri, Balrampur, Makhdumpur, Obra, Sugauli, Belsand, Marhaura, Sherghati, Bodhgaya, Rajauli, Govindpur, Bochha, Bakhtiarpur, Fatuha, Bahadurganj, Mahua, Chenari, Maner and Kasba.However, the party ultimately contested 28 seats, as the nomination of its Marhaura candidate, Seema Singh, was rejected.The LJP (RV) chose not to field a replacement, and the NDA instead extended support to independent candidate Ankit Kumar.The party was established in 2021 following a power tussle between Chirag Paswan and his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, which resulted in the split of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) into two factions. The faction led by Paswan was named the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in memory of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away in 2020, while the group headed by Paras came to be known as the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.Also read: 'Gamcha' in the air: PM Modi leads celebrations after NDA secures sweeping victory in Bihar elections- Watch Formed in 2000 by Ram Vilas Paswan, the original LJP made a strong debut in the February 2005 Bihar assembly elections, winning 29 seats (178 contested) in a contest that produced a fractured verdict. However, its tally dropped to 10 (202 contested) in the re-election held in October the same year. The party’s strength further declined to three seats in 2010 and just two in 2015. In the 2020 assembly polls, despite being an NDA ally, the LJP contested 134 seats independently, winning only one — but inflicting considerable damage on the Janata Dal (United).The success of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has vindicated what was once seen as a risky move, firmly consolidating Chirag Paswan’s standing within the NDA. The outcome is likely to further endear the Hajipur MP to the BJP leadership — particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi — whom Paswan has described himself as being “Hanuman” to. The young actor-turned-politician’s rising influence could also set the stage for a future political face-off with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav for Bihar’s chief ministerial post in the 2030 assembly elections.","Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies.

NEW DELHI: Many surprising wins and losses marked Friday's results as Bihar finalised its mandate, delivering a sweeping victory to the NDA and extending its nearly two-decade-long dominance under chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has switched alliances several times over the years very conveniently.What was expected to be a close contest between the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan instead turned into a decisive, one-sided mandate. The NDA is poised to comfortably cross the 200-seat mark in the 243-member assembly, while the Mahagathbandhan has collapsed to under 40 seats.The grand old party -- Congress, once a major force in the state, has been reduced to a near-wipeout, winning hardly about 10 per cent of the 61 seats it contested.The verdict also produced several striking wins and unexpected defeats across Bihar. While JD(U) strongman Anant Singh retained his bastion, many prominent figures in Patna failed to secure victories.Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav eventually retained his family stronghold of Raghopur in Vaishali district after a tense, fluctuating contest. Throughout the day, he alternated between leads and trails, making the outcome far from the comfortable victory his family traditionally enjoyed from this seat.In 2020, Tejashwi had secured Raghopur with ease. He won again this time, but without the dominance that pollsters or supporters expected.JD(U) heavyweight Anant Singh once again proved his unshakable hold over Mokama. Despite being jailed in connection with the recent killing of Jan Suraaj worker Dular Chand Yadav and facing repeated allegations of muscle power, Singh secured yet another victory.Just days before polling, he was taken into custody in the same case, yet voters reaffirmed their trust in him as they have many times before. Known for his trademark sunglasses and brief, punchy remarks to the media, Singh emerged victorious even from behind bars.Folk singer and influencer Maithili Thakur, contesting her first election on a BJP ticket, won comfortably from Alinagar by more than 11,000 votes, defeating veteran RJD leader Binod Mishra. This makes her the youngest MLA in the Bihar assembly.The BJP’s gamble on her reach and cultural appeal paid off—the party has won this seat for the first time since 2008. Alinagar, in Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, saw a three-way contest involving Thakur, Mishra, and Jan Suraaj’s Biplaw Chaudhary.Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav, fielded by the RJD from Chapra in Saran district, failed to convert his popularity into votes. Unlike other film stars who transitioned successfully into politics—such as Ravi Kishan, Manoj Tiwari, or Dinesh Lal “Nirahua” Yadav—Khesari struggled from the beginning.He eventually lost by over 10,000 votes to BJP’s Chhoti Kumari. For the RJD, which had backed him despite his limited political experience, his defeat was a major embarrassment.Tej Pratap Yadav, son of former CM Lalu Prasad Yadav , estranged from the RJD, and founder of the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) suffered a significant defeat in Mahua. Contesting from the same district as his brother Tejashwi and from a seat he once held, Tej Pratap was unable to mobilise support for his new party, resulting in a heavy loss.In Simri Bakhtiarpur, RJD leader and sitting MLA Yusuf Salahuddin, son of veteran politician and former parliamentarian Mehboob Ali Kaiser, was defeated by Sanjay Kumar Singh of the Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV). Sanjay won by more than 7,000 votes, marking another high-profile setback for the RJD.","The NDA is poised to comfortably cross the 200-seat mark in the 243-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: Congress's abysmal show threatens to again trap the party in the rut that it has been trying to climb out of since 2014 - an endless cycle of recriminations, dissent and defections, and whispered demands for change of personnel and strategy.Coming against the backdrop of shocking losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, this setback will only harden the belief among party functionaries that the future remains bleak, a concern that had triggered an exodus of popular faces between 2014 and 2023.There is now a serious worry the defeat will revive public airing of grievances from restive souls within, a strong possibility given that many have been upset with the party's focus in recent months. A couple of popular faces are even said to be waiting for their opportunity.An ominous warning came from an unlikely corner. Mumtaz Patel, daughter of the late Ahmed Patel, posted on X: ""It's time to look within and accept reality. Till when will countless loyal ground workers who have stayed with the party through thick and thin wait to see success... it's failure after failure due to power concentrated in the hands of a few who are totally disconnected with ground reality...these same people will be rewarded again and again because they have made themselves indispensable with their control and power. ""MP Shashi Tharoor minced no words either: ""I have been talking to people...our party leaders must do some very serious analysis of where things went wrong ... how our organisation functions."" Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh said ""elections are about intensive public contact at booth level"" while Karnataka state chief and deputy CM DK Shivakumar advocated the need to work out a new strategy.After the high of the 2024 Lok Sabha contest where it emerged with its dignity intact despite an uphill battle, Congress has been on an uninterrupted decline, losing Haryana and Maharashtra, states it was expected to win, and finishing with a pathetic tally in J&K.Bihar is yet more proof that Congress has lost its way electorally. In a typical paradox that plagues Congress, the party was a fringe player in Bihar, but its national appeal as embodiment of anti-BJP politics provided the base from which local powerhouse RJD was to fire. But even as a side player, it could not fulfil its promise of being a strong supporting ally (like it did in Jharkhand last year). This time, its tally was in single digits, even lower than the 19 seats it won out of the 71 contested in 2020.",Congress's abysmal show threatens to again trap the party in the rut that it has been trying to climb out of since 2014.

NEW DELHI: The five seats won by Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM in Seemanchal region of east Bihar, where Muslim voters have a substantial presence, reflect the community's willingness to diversify its options in areas where it feels secure that experimentation may not benefit BJP.Results show that AIMIM won five of nine constituencies with more than 40% Muslim population, with its Muslim candidates securing decisive victories. They defeated four Muslim candidates fielded either by Mahagathbandhan or JDU, and in one seat, the party defeated a Hindu candidate from BJP. In three of the five victories, AIMIM defeated NDA candidates, including two from JDU. The five seats won by AIMIM are Baisi, Jokihat, Bahadurganj, Kochadhaman and Amour.The party also fielded seven candidates in constituencies where Muslim population ranges between 25% and 40%, but it failed to win any of these seats, which went to NDA. Except for Congress, which won Kishanganj seat, neither RJD nor CPIML-Liberation registered a victory in the belt - marking a shift from the decades-long pattern of Muslims backing an RJD-led alliance. The outcome points to something larger - a desire to look beyond Hindu-led parties and prefer an outfit seen as their ""own,"" even at the risk of aiding BJP and its allies.This pattern first surfaced in the 2020 elections when Muslims in Seemanchal voted for Owaisi despite accusations from RJD and Congress that he was BJP's ""B-team."" AIMIM had then won five seats, though four later defected to RJD. Yet the party's base does not appear eroded. Owaisi has tapped into the community's ""sense of hurt"" over what political scientists term ""invisibilisation,"" pointing out how secular parties seek Muslim votes but hesitate to offer ""fair"" representation. The results indicate that many in the community are listening - something that may, in the future, force secular parties to confront tough choices over greater Muslim representation.","Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM won five seats in Seemanchal region of east Bihar.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: From a low of 43 seats in 2020 to a high of 85, an almost 100% jump as the counting progressed on Friday, Janata Dal (United) has delivered a knockout punch to the naysayers and burnished its credentials as a lead BJP ally in a politically crucial Hindi heartland state.The tally will be the second highest for CM Nitish Kumar-led party, which had won 115 seats in alliance with BJP in 2010 in the 243-member assembly in an electoral battle that had annihilated the RJD-led opposition on a scale similar to this election's.JDU entered the political fray amid rising skepticism over its strength as questions mounted over the health of its mascot Nitish and the virtually non-existent second line of leadership, rooted in its traditional vote bank drawn from sections of OBCs, EBCs and Dalits.Its lowest ever tally in 2020 came largely due to Chirag Paswan-led LJP's fielding its candidates mostly against JDU, dealing it a hammer blow.Its strong show has opened a narrow path for JDU to make overtures to voting blocs like Muslims and Yadavs who have long been loyal to RJD but will turn increasingly restive as another spell out of power looms for them, with the main opposition party looking at an uncertain future.Muslims have already displayed their thinning patience with MGB by backing AIMIM in substantial numbers in this poll and have maintained some goodwill for Nitish despite his alliance with BJP and their recent protest against his support to the amendments in Waqf Act. BJP, too, in the past has reached out to Yadavs and Union minister Nityanand Rai, a member from the community, enjoys an important position in the party.As JDU prepared for the 2025 poll and for the first time contested the same number of seats, and not more, as BJP, questions were raised whether history would repeat itself and NDA would again have to bank disproportionately on BJP to cross the majority mark.However, it is a testament to Nitish's appeal that what was considered a vulnerable stage of his nearly five-decade-long political journey sparked a wave of support for him among his supporters, especially women who have benefitted from his multiple schemes, with the cash assistance of Rs 10,000 to 1.5 crore of them being the latest.Steadfast support from BJP, which has also made inroads among JDU's traditional supporters, has also helped.The regional party's win on 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2024 made it the second largest ally of BJP after TDP and helped it claw back some of its lost influence as the saffron party lost majority support and had to depend on partners to form the govt at the Centre.JDU's stupendous performance in the poll, however, has dispelled doubts about its popularity. At the same time, its future is tied to Nitish's health, though the party has dismissed questions on this count.","Janata Dal (United) has delivered a knockout punch to the naysayers and burnished its credentials as a lead BJP ally.

NEW DELHI: The Bihar results have delivered a major blow to CPI(Marxist-Leninist) Liberation with its double-digit tally of 12 seats in 2020 plummeting to mere 2 seats - Karakat and Paliganj - out of the 20 it contested this time. The party that traces its beginnings to mass movements and grassroots mobilisation among the landless and marginalised failed to retain even its strongholds.While describing the election outcome as “unnatural and not a reflection of ground reality” and claiming that the result was facilitated by deletion and addition of voters and by dispensing of the dole to women, party general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya did acknowledge the need for parties in the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ to “introspect” on this severe setback.The CPI(ML) certainly needed to take a closer look at its strategy. Not only has it lost in its strongholds, the party which played a crucial role in keeping together the rather fragile alliance is set to lose its place as one of the grouping’s key anchors because of the abysmal performance.In what was seen as a strong comeback in 2020, the Left party had secured 12 of the 19 seats it contested as part of the Mahagathbandhan, emerging as a critical force with grassroots influence in belts like Bhojpur, Siwan and Arrah.Its influence in the alliance was evident ahead of the current polls. Through the power-play over ticket distribution and declaration of Tejaswi Yadav as the CM face of the alliance, one saw Bhattacharya playing a key role in ironing out differences between RJD and Congress.It is also felt that CPI(ML)’s going along with its Mahagathbandhan partner RJD’s decision to field Osama Shahab from Raghunathpur would not have gone unnoticed among the core support base of the Left party, impacting its image as a crusader for the marginalised. Osama’s late father and former Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin was accused of ordering the 1997 killing of student activist Chandrashekhar, who was associated with the Left party and seen as his potential political rival.While CPI(ML) candidates won merely two seats - Paliganj and Karakat, the party lost in Agiaon (SC) by a narrow margin of 95 votes. In three other seats - Balrampur, Dumraon and Zeeradei, the margin of defeat was less than 3,000. The party contested 20 seats this time and its vote share sands at close to 3%.The other Left parties too have performed poorly, with CPI(M) winning just 1 of 4 seats as against 2 last time and CPI, which had won 2 seats last time, failing to open its account though it contested 6.Reflecting on the verdict the CPI(ML) general secretary said that the outcome ""has the scars of SIR all over it. The role of the unprecedented money transfer operation amounting to Rs 30,000 crore among a beneficiary population of 3 crore defying all notions of election ethics and model code of conduct must also be taken into account.""""A virtual repeat of the 2010 outcome after fifteen years when the credibility of the Nitish Kumar government has touched an all-time low and the Modi government too suffered a major loss of support just a year ago defies credulity. We will undertake a thorough analysis of the outcome and draw necessary lessons,"" Bhattacharya added.CPI(M) general secretary MA Baby described the result as a setback for the ‘mahagathbandhan’ and accused the NDA of utilising the state machinery and resorting to all sorts of manipulation including the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to bank accounts of women beneficiaries ahead of polls. The party in a statement said that the ""NDA benefited from the polarising communal and cateist rhetoric of its leaders, including the Prime Minister and home minister"". “All this drowned out the issues like unemployment and even vote chori raised by the mahagathbandhan,” Baby said. However, he called for introspection over how key players could have put up a more united fight to counter the NDA in the elections.A leader said that while the Mahagathbandhan was able to raise the ‘vote chori’ issue with the people effectively, somewhere the alliance on ground was unable to mobilise the people to come out and vote to seek transparency in the polling system.The Left party leaders also cite that the way RJD and Congress delayed resolving differences over ticket distribution sent out a negative message about the mahagathbandhan lacking unity. This was further aggravated by what was referred to as “friendly fights” on nearly 10 seats where no consensus could be reached.",The Bihar results have delivered a major blow to CPI(Marxist-Leninist) Liberation. Its double-digit tally of 12 seats in 2020 plummeting to mere 2 seats.

NEW DELHI: Staring at a political abyss in the face of continued decline post-2014 - hastened after 2019 - a flailing opposition came together to give itself the collective moniker 'INDIA', vowing to stick together and fight jointly. It enjoyed a surge in fortunes and gave the governing BJP alliance a scare in 2024.The INDIA bloc - stacked with competitive allies - managed to find a fomula that allowed members to back each other despite the odd flaring up of contradictions. It helped the bloc in Jharkhand and J&K last year though it failed to rescue them in Maharashtra where Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress came up rather as a squabbling team.Bihar was a crucial test for the opposition bloc. RJD, the lead player, was to take along Congress, Left and caste outfits to challenge the JDU-BJP combine. That it came a cropper is bound to raise questions for opposition as key contests await the INDIA bloc in Bengal and Tamil Nadu.TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that Congress is too weak to offer any value in an alliance, repeating the 2024 line when the two contested as rivals despite being part of the same umbrella nationally.The immediate challenge for Congress is the Bengal dilemma - should it target Mamata or BJP.A crucial overlapping constituency between TMC and Congress is the large minority populace in Bengal - and it would present a serious conundrum for Congress, which has been quick to dismiss such ""secular"" rivals in other states as BJP's ""B-team"".Tamil Nadu is a curious case, too. While alliance is a settled subject, with Congress brass and DMK supremo M K Stalin being on ""my brother"" terms, local Congress is chafing at the 'domineering' attitude of 'big brother'. Local Congress functionaries have been demanding that the terms of partnership be rewritten. And Congress argues that its 8% vote would be critical for DMK in case there's an AIADMK-headed joint opposition.Some are already blaming Congress's hard bargaining with RJD - as also vice versa - for delaying the campaign and joint strategy plan in Bihar. The party may have to return to ""sacrifice"" mode - as in 2024 - to help put the alliance back on track.","Bihar was a crucial test for the opposition bloc.

Kural 931

Even if you win, do not gamble; the bait may be made of gold, yet what good

Is it to the fish that swallows it?

I have often wondered why someone as virtuous as Yudhishthira should resort to gambling so fervently — to the point of pledging Draupadi herself. Was he a compulsive gambler? Why could he not resist the temptation to play further, even as his fortune slipped away?Thetells us he was lured, that destiny led him to the dice. Yet once seated at the table, it was not fate but frenzy that consumed him — the shimmer of chance, the intoxication of gamble. He played ceaselessly, mindlessly, raising the stakes until he lost every possession, every relationship, every ounce of dignity. In that hall of deceit, Yudhishthira was not conquered by Sakuni but by his own delusion — the belief that one more throw of the dice might change his fate.Modern science offers an explanation. Gambling activates the brain’s reward system much like drugs or alcohol do. The tragedy of gambling-related suicides has become a quiet epidemic.When I was very young, I watched a Shivaji Ganesan–Padmini film titled. A couple, long childless, are finally blessed with a son. The boy becomes their world. One day, the father takes him to a wedding while the mother stays back, warning him repeatedly to take care of the child.At the wedding hall, the father meets old friends playing cards and succumbs soon. The clink of coins, the rhythm of the cards — all blur into one. His eyes gleam with a fever that blinds him to everything else. The child, forgotten, wanders away into the night. The rest of the film is a long search — for the boy, for forgiveness, for peace. What I still remember is the extraordinary acting of legend Shivaji Ganesan that depicts how gamblers succumb to temptation.Thiruvalluvar, in his timeless wisdom, captures this folly with haunting precision:In the same chapter, Valluvar condemns gambling across all the ten couplets. So gambling clubs existed as an organised business even two millennia ago! Today, gambling houses are not tucked away in alleys; they are glowing icons on our phones. Betting apps promise easy money, masking risk as entertainment. Once I took a cab from airport to my office in Mumbai. The cab driver, mistaking me for an IT professional, asked if I could ‘hack’ a gambling app. I was appalled and asked why. He had lost 12.7 lakh rupees on one such app and if I could help hack that app, he could recover his losses. I was stunned — not just by the scale of loss, but by the desperation that drives people to such extremes.These digital platforms blur the line between play and peril. What begins as harmless fun often turns into addiction — a slow erosion of willpower.Perhaps the only remedy is to recognise gambling as what it is — a snare. As Valluvar warned, even victory in gambling is defeat in disguise. The bait may glitter, but to swallow it is to lose everything that matters — as Yudhishthira learned, too late, in the echoing silence after the last throw of the dice. He has lost Draupadi.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125322309,imgsize-89688,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/125322309.jpg"

With the elections over, Bihar's finance department will have to pull out the spreadsheets to redo the fiscal arithmetic as the government will have to raise resources to not just meet the big promises made in the NDA manifesto, including more money to the 74 lakh farmers, SC students and others in the state, but also to fund capital expenditure (capex) to build two greenfield cities (New Patna and Sitapuram) and create farm infrastructure.In a state with an estimated fiscal deficit of 9.2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) last year and own-tax revenue budgeted at 5.3% of state GDP this year, there is chatter of a review of prohibition imposed by Nitish Kumar in 2016. Getting the NDA to reverse the ban may not be easy as it has a lot of appeal with women voters who are pro-prohibition.But there is a large revenue potential since the state government was earning over Rs 3,000 crore annually from alcohol sales in 2015-16 - more than enough to cover the Rs 2,200 crore needed for additional direct transfer to farmers. At current prices, the mop-up will only be higher.In any case, the pre-poll announcement of Rs 10,000 for the currently enrolled 1.5 crore women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana will cost Rs 15,000 crore.Besides, an increase in the monthly pension to Rs 1,100 for 1.1 crore elders, widows and disabled will result in an additional outgo of around Rs 8,500 crore with nearly Rs 4,000 crore likely to be provided for free electricity of up to 125 units.The bill will go beyond the additional Rs 28,000-crore outgo due to the schemes already implemented. After all, the NDA manifesto promises Rs 2,000 assistance to SC students in colleges and support to fisherfolk (see graphic).As a result, Bihar is unlikely to close the financial year with a budgeted fiscal deficit of 3% of state GDP this year, unless it can reduce other expenditure or raise resources from new sources.After all, with 60% of the expenditure already committed to interest payments, salaries and pension and other establishment-related spending, there are few options.",Bihar's finance department will have to pull out the spreadsheets to redo the fiscal arithmetic.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed's elder brother, says family is in 'complete disbelief' Says family had not been in contact with her for past four years.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad.A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

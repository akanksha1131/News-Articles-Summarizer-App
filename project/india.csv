"No pressure to make way for Raj’s son, claims Sada",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pressure-to-make-way-for-rajs-son-claims-sada/articleshow/114833880.cms,"MUMBAI:

Despite deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying the BJP is committed to supporting Amit Thackeray , the MNS candidate from the Mahim assembly constituency, sitting Shiv Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar , has begun his campaign with full force.He has hit the campaign trail with roadshows, processions, corner meetings and community engagement initiatives. He launched his campaign on Wednesday evening. He said his eletion was taken over by the people, adding that there was no pressure from any netas on him to withdraw, but there was pressure from Mahim voters to fight the election and win. The last date for withdrawing nominations is Nov 4.“Shiv Sainiks blew trumpets, and the coconuts of the campaign were broken. I started campaigning as a Mahayuti candidate for the Mahim constituency . The first campaign received a great response. Beloved sisters and women Shiv Sainiks were also present in large numbers. All office-bearers and activists of Shiv Sena Mahayuti also participated in the campaign. The same enthusiasm will be seen throughout the election,” Sarvankar said in a post on X.On Wednesday, speaking about the Mahim seat, Fadnavis said, “Even the CM did not want to contest the Mahim seat, but there were some difficulties. Rather, their party leaders were of the opinion that those votes would go to Sena (UBT), and hence they decided to put up a candidate.” He said, “Our stand right from the beginning was that it is one seat where MNS has asked for support, and BJP was in favour of it.”A day after filing his no mination, Sarvankar on Thursday made an emotional appeal to MNS chief Raj Thackeray, asking him “not to do injustice to workers like him and instead give him support”. In a post on X, Sarvankar, who is a three-time MLA, said Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray would not have asked Sarvankar to give up his seat for Balasaheb’s relatives. The Sena (UBT) candidate in Mahim is Mahesh Sawant.","Sada Sarvankar has hit the campaign trail with roadshows, processions, corner meetings and community engagement initiatives.

Cong says sure of getting most of its ‘serious’ rebels to withdraw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-says-sure-of-getting-most-of-its-serious-rebels-to-withdraw/articleshow/114832791.cms,"Mumbai :

AICC general secretary Avinash Pandey on Thursday said except for a few, most rebel Congress candidates will return to the party fold before the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers (Nov 4).“Rebel candidates are our party activists. During elections, it happens that those who do not secure nominations contest against the party nominee. We have set up a multi-member team to interact with them. We will pacify them. I am sure they will return to the fold,” he told TOI.According to an MPCC leader, there are about 100 rebels across the state, of which fewer than 20-25 are serious. If they do not withdraw, they will damage prospects of the Congress nominee in their constituency. “We have reached all the potential serious rebels. Efforts are on to persuade them to withdraw from the fray in the larger interest of the party,” he said.The AICC has appointed Ashok Gehlot and G Parameshwara to oversee polls for Mumbai and Konkan, Bhupesh Baghel, Charanjit Channi and Umar Singher for Vidarbha, Sachin Pilot and Uttamkumar Reddy for Marathwada, T S Singhdeo and M B Patil for Western Maharashtra, and Syed Naseer Hussain and Anasuya Seethaka for North Maharashtra . In addition, Avinash Pandey and Muskul Wasnik will be state election coordinators.Further, an MPCC leader said, MPCC president Nana Patole will interact with rebels in the Vidarbha region, Amit Deshmukh in Marathwada, Balasaheb Thorat in North Maharashtra, Prithvi raj Chavan and Satej Patil in Western Maharashtra, and Varsha Gaikwad in Mumbai.AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala is camping in Mumbai and persuading rebel candidates.","AICC general secretary Avinash Pandey said except for a few, most rebel Congress candidates will return to the party fold.

"Inclusive measure falls short, 5-day window for home voting registration leaves seniors shortchanged",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inclusive-measure-falls-short-5-day-window-for-home-voting-regn-leaves-seniors-shortchanged/articleshow/114831913.cms,"MUMBAI :

Jimmy Dordi (85) was thrilled at the prospect of voting from home, a new EC initiative allowing seniors with limited mobility to participate in the democratic process without leaving their homes. But by the time he learned of the facility, the fiveday registration window slipped by, leaving him frustrated and unable to arrange for the paperwork in time. “The announcement came so suddenly. By the time I knew of it, I had no time to make arrangements,” Dordi shared from his Borivli room, where he’s largely confined to the bed and relies on a caregiver.The sentiment is shared by many seniors for whom voting remains a cherished duty but find themselves cut off by circumstance rather than choice. “Last time, my son took me but now I can’t walk. Even an auto ride is impossible,” said Dordi.For the first time, EC announced an at-home voting facility for citizens aged 85 and above for the LS polls this year, allowing them to cast a postal ballot . Many who long gave up hope of voting due to health issues took advantage of the opportunity. Officials visited their homes ahead of polling day to collect their votes. However, for the assembly polls, the short registration window—announced on Oct 22, with seniors and people with disabilities asked to register by October 27—left many struggling to complete the process for the inclusive measure in time.As of October 15, the state has 9.6 crore registered voters, including 13.15 lakh aged 85 and above, with 56.3 per cent of them female and 43.8 per cent male. The aim, according to officials, is to boost voter turnout in the state and encourage every eligible voter to cast their ballot, with the hope that the voting percentage in Maharashtra will exceed 70 per cent.When Yashwant Bagve (88), from Goregaon West, found out about the initiative, he was keen on using it but was frustrated by the tight dead line. “They only gave us five days. That’s not enough,” said Bagve, who lives alone and found that applying for the service was particularly challenging for seniors his age, who often struggle with mobility and other health issues.As for his voting plans now, Bagve, who has osteoarthritis, isn’t certain. “I might still go out to vote if the polling station is accessible. But if it’s on an upper floor, it will be very tough,” he said. “See, we want to participate but they need to make it a bit easier for us,” said Bagve, hopeful that more seniors will be accommodated in future elections.Andheri’s resident Chandrakant Doshi (89) plans to head to the polling station himself. “It’s close by, so I’ll manage,” he said confidently. But the at-home voting option, aservice his wife, Rama, has come to rely on, is more than a convenience or a civic duty; it’s about belonging to the community and a chance for seniors to stay engaged.“She’s 88, largely bedridden and doesn’t leave the house much anymore, but her right to vote is important to her, and she insisted on exercising it even if it had to be done right at home,” said Doshi, who is also working to spread the word to others in the community as head of a senior citizen activity centre in Andheri, where he regularly updates everyone on election facilities. “We’ve seen turnout drop over the years. So, facilities like this really help, especially for those who struggle to leave their homes.”A key challenge with the rollout, said Prakash Borgaonkar, CEO of Aaji Care Sevak Foundation and veteran advocate for elderly welfare for nearly four decades, was lack of awareness and communication channels. “When I reached out to many senior citizens , some didn’t even know about this option. And those who did, struggled with the process,” he said, pointing at a common concern among seniors today—proper implementation of govt schemes.“These are great ideas, but they need to materialize in real ways. For instance, a govt resolution was recently passed for Jestha Nagarik Mahamandal, a state senior citizens’ corporation, but when we followed up, it felt like just a pre-election formality. Nothing concrete on the ground,” said Borgaonkar, who is part of Maharashtra’s Joint Action Committee (JAC) comprising 26 organizations representing NGOs, researchers and gerontology experts. JAC has laid out an ambitious manifesto to reshape policies and programmes for senior citizens, who now make up nearly 12 per cent of Maharashtra’s population, and is proposing ‘councils’ at district and state levels with a mix of NGO members, academics and legal experts as well as seniors to keep these initiatives accountable.","For the first time, EC announced an at-home voting facility for citizens aged 85 and above for the LS polls this year.

They are also caused by the displacement of rocks due to groundwater utilisation and when air contained in small cavities inside the earth escapes through tube wells, KSDMA said.It said a decision has been taken to subject the site to a geophysical survey to understand the structure of the area more accurately and for that the Kozhikode NIT has been contacted by the KSDMA.Regarding the damage suffered by some buildings due to the vibrations, it said the same was due to ""age and structural weakness"".Nearly 300 people were moved to safety after the ""explosion-like"" sounds accompanied by tremors were heard in Anakkallu on Tuesday night.

""I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,"" Trump said.Hasina's resignation on August 5, which was spurred by widespread protests against a contentious government job quota system, has left the country in disarray, prompting the establishment of a caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.This is for the first time that Trump has addressed the crisis in Bangladesh, where reports indicate that hundreds of Hindus were killed during protests in July and August. He contrasted his approach to that of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he accused of ignoring the plight of Hindus both globally and domestically.""It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border,"" Trump said, adding, ""but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength!""Trump also critiqued Biden and Harris on economic matters, claiming, ""Kamala Harris will destroy your small businesses with more regulations and higher taxes. By contrast, I cut taxes, cut regulations, unleashed American energy, and built the greatest economy in history.

Actor Darshan gets interim bail for 6 weeks in Renukaswamy murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/darshan-gets-interim-bail-for-6-weeks-in-renukaswamy-murder-case/articleshow/114761590.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka high court on Wednesday granted interim bail for six weeks to jailed actor Darshan Thoogudeepa , prime accused in the Renukaswamy murder case .The bail was granted to the actor on medical grounds to undergo spine surgery. As per the bail condition, the actor has been asked to surrender his passport.Darshan is currently lodged in Karnataka's Ballari jail.Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty reserved the order on Tuesday on actor Darshan’s interim bail application after hearing comprehensive arguments from his legal counsel, senior advocate C.V. Nagesh, and the state’s public prosecutor, P. Prasanna Kumar.During the hearing, the state submitted medical reports in a sealed cover from doctors at Ballari Central Prison, where Darshan is being held, and from the head of Neurology at a government hospital in Ballari.Nagesh argued that Darshan is experiencing numbness in both feet and requested permission for him to undergo surgery at a private hospital in Mysuru, with the actor covering all associated costs.According to police reports, 33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan of Darshan, allegedly sent obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda, Darshan’s friend and a co-accused in the case, which angered Darshan and supposedly led to the murder.Renukaswamy’s body was discovered on June 9 near a stormwater drain by an apartment in Sumanahalli, Bengaluru. Police investigations revealed that Raghavendra, one of Darshan’s fan club members in Chitradurga, brought Renukaswamy to a shed in R.R. Nagar, claiming that Darshan wanted to meet him. It was there that Renukaswamy was reportedly tortured and murdered.The post-mortem report revealed that Renukaswamy, a native of Chitradurga, died from shock and hemorrhage due to multiple blunt injuries.Police have identified Pavithra, the primary accused, as a key instigator in Renukaswamy’s murder, asserting that she conspired with others involved and played an active role in the crime.","Darshan Thoogudeepa is prime accused in the Renukaswamy murder case.

They either go to the Governor or the Prime Minister. I would like to ask the BJP MP, during the tenure, was the State Waqf Department locked?

Do they have any common sense, how the law works, how the procedure works?...These people are just out to play politics with it,"" Priyank Kharge, who is the son of congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said, according to news agency ANI.Earlier, as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee currently reviewing amendments to the Waqf Act, Tejasvi Surya said, ""There have been multiple press conferences and videos in the public domain where the minister himself has admitted that these Waqf adalats are being conducted under the chief Minister's instructions.""Surya flagged that farmers from various districts have reported abrupt and unauthorized transfers of their land ownership to the Waqf Board. ""Over the last few days, farmers from many districts across Karnataka have been raising alarms that, without any notice from revenue authorities or adherence to due legal processes, changes have been made to their land records, RTCs, mutation registers, and other documents. Ownership has, in many cases, been suddenly transferred to the Waqf, causing serious panic among thousands of farmers across the state.""However, this was not the first the BJP MP had raised this. On Wednesday, he wrote to Waqf Bill JPC Chairman Jagdambika Pal, asking him to visit Vijayapura district where the Muslim body has claimed ownership of 1500 acres of farmers' lands. Surya said he met a delegation of farmers from the Vijayapura district, who have cultivated their lands for nearly a century and maintain records dating back to the 1920s and 1930s.""In recent months, however, many of them have been served notices declaring their lands as Waqf property, without any accompanying evidence or explanation,"" he said in his letter.The BJP MP said the scale of these claims is substantial, with nearly 1,500 acres being designated as Waqf property in their village alone. ""The farmers claim that apart from being served notices, changes have been made in the RTC, pahani and mutation registers for some of the land parcels without following the due process of law.""""I, therefore, request that you invite the delegation of affected farmers to appear as witnesses before the Committee. Their testimony will provide valuable insights into the local implications of the proposed amendments and the pressing issues faced by the farming community in this regard,"" he said.After the controversy over the notices erupted, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said none of the farmers will be evicted, and notices issued to them will be withdrawn.Responding to a question that similar notices have been issued to farmers in Yadgir and Dharwad districts too, the CM said: ""I will ask the Revenue Minister to look into it, nowhere farmers will be evicted."" Seeking to clarify ""confusion"" over 1,200 acres in Honavada of Tikota taluk being marked as Waqf property, M B Patil (Industries and Vijayapura district in-charge Minister) had recently said it was due to an “error” in the gazette notification.",Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge responded to BJP MP Tejasvi Surya's charge that Waqf Board was encroaching thousands of acres of farmers' land in Karnataka.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a huge shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

He highlighted the party's unity in the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, where the NCP secured 54 seats and formed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Pawar said, ""The party came to power due to that success because of which they became ministers. But some of our colleagues did not remember this. Some of our colleagues took away 44 of the 54 MLAs and joined the other side and created a wrong picture in the state.""He specifically referred to the split within the NCP in 2023 when Ajit Pawar and other MLAs joined the BJP and Shiv Sena, becoming part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. Ajit Pawar later secured the party name and symbol from the Election Commission.Pawar said, ""They got the power they desired. It is not that they had not got the power earlier but the move to break the party to obtain power was not appropriate.""He expressed disappointment with MLA Walse Patil for participating in the decision to break away from the party, emphasising that the people of Ambegaon were not in favor of such a move.Pawar reminisced about his long association with Walse Patil's father and his efforts to mentor the current minister. He also mentioned his ongoing work at the national level and how some state leaders whom he trusted took advantage of their positions.Concluding, Pawar urged NCP (SP) workers and Nikam's supporters to back him in the upcoming assembly elections and ensure his victory.Meanwhile, NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule shared on Thursday that the Pawar family is united for Diwali and has upheld the tradition of celebrating the festival together in Baramati since childhood. ""Since childhood, we have always come to Baramati for Diwali celebration. The entire Pawar family is together on Diwali,"" Sule said.Baramati, the family's stronghold in Maharashtra, is set to witness an internal electoral rivalry, with NCP leader Ajit Pawar going up against his nephew Yugendra Pawar, the son of his younger brother Shrinivas Pawar, in an upcoming contest.",NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar targeted several Ajit Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party leaders for splitting the party for power.

Silver outshines gold for first time in festive season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silver-outshines-gold-for-first-time-in-festive-season/articleshow/114795481.cms,"HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of the Indian jewellery market , silver glittered more than gold this Dhanteras . As gold prices continued their record-breaking run, it dampened consumer demand. Shoppers instead rushed to buy silver."" Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras,"" Surendra Mehta, national secretary at Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), said. ""We are collating data for silver because this is the first time we are seeing such a huge demand,"" Mehta told TOI.For one, the high price of gold dissuaded many buyers and prompted them to look at silver instead. In addition to the demand for silver jewellery, the expected high industrial demand for the white metal - mainly from booming EV manufacturers - is making it the most sought-after precious metal now. ""People have now begun to understand that there is a real opportunity in investing in silver,"" Mehta added.While demand for silver during Dhanteras this year surged 30-35%, sales of gold were 15% lower at around 35-36 tonne as compared to 42 tonne last festive season. However, thanks to about a 30% rise in average price of the yellow metal, sales (in value terms) were higher at nearly Rs 28,000 crore from about Rs 24,000-25,000 crore last year.The World Gold Council too has projected that India's gold demand could hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the unprecedented record-breaking rally in prices. In Wednesday's mid-session, gold prices on NYMEX went above the $2,800-per-ounce mark for the first time in history on the back of global uncertainties relating to geopolitical issues, the US election, as well as continuing demand from central banks and the solar energy industry.Gold demand in India - the world's secon-biggest consumer of the precious metal - could stand between 700 tonne and 750 tonne in 2024, the lowest since 2020 and down from last year's 761 tonne, Sachin Jain, regional CEO (India) at WGC, was quoted as saying by Reuters.In the local market and commodities exchange, gold price was hovering above the Rs 80,000 per 10 gram level, while silver prices stayed above the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst (commodities) at HDFC Securities, said that gold's record on Wednesday came after the US treasury yields and the dollar fell following mixed US macro data.",Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras.

During these discussions, officials from both nations sought to restore the ground situation through equitable security measures, leading to this latest consensus.Speaking at an event in Assam’s Tezpur earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh expressed optimism regarding the de-escalation efforts. “Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer,” he said.Chinese ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, shared similar sentiments, highlighting the importance of managing and resolving differences constructively. “It is natural for neighboring countries like India and China to have differences, but the focus should be on how we handle these,” Xu remarked, adding that the successful disengagement at Demchok and Depsang sets a positive tone for future cooperation in politics, business, and education.After the de-escalation, Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a formal meeting, their first structured discussion in five years, on the sidelines of Brics summit in Russia.The leaders reaffirmed the importance of maintaining stable relations, citing the benefits to both Indian and Chinese citizens as well as to regional and global peace.","Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets at several points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to mark festival of Diwali.

India may face 25% GDP loss by '70 due to climate change: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-may-face-25-gdp-loss-by-70-due-to-climate-change-study/articleshow/114829518.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: Climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could lead to a 16.9% loss in GDP by 2070 across the Asia and Pacific region, with India projected to suffer a 24.7% GDP loss , according to a new report. Rising sea levels and decreasing labour productivity would drive the most significant losses, with lower-income and fragile economies being hit the hardest, it said. The new research, presented in the inaugural issue of ADB 's "" Asia-Pacific Climate Report"", details a series of damaging impacts threatening the region.It says that if the climate crisis continues to accelerate, up to 300 million people in the region could be at risk from coastal inundation, and trillions of dollars' worth of coastal assets could face annual damage by 2070.""Climate change has supercharged the devastation from tropical storms, heat waves, and floods in the region, contributing to unprecedented economic challenges and human suffering,"" said ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa.Urgent, well-coordinated climate action addressing these impacts is necessary before it is too late, he said.This climate report provides insights into financing urgent adaptation needs and offers promising policy recommendations to governments in our developing member countries on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost, he added. ""By 2070, climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could cause a total loss of 16.9% of GDP across the Asia and Pacific region. Most of the region would face more than 20%. The report said that developing Asia has accounted for most of the increase in global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions since 2000. While advanced economies were major GHG emitters throughout the 20th century, emissions from Asia have risen more rapidly than those from any other region in the first two decades of the 21st century.""Consequently, the region's share of global emissions rose from 29.4% in 2000 to 45.9% in 2021... Emissions from Asia continue to rise, driven primarily by China, which contributed about 30 per cent of global emissions in 2021,"" the ADB report said.The report pointed out that the region is home to 60 per cent of the world's population, with per capita emissions still below the global average.Intensified and more variable rainfall, along with increasingly extreme storms, will lead to more frequent landslides and floods in the region, it said. ""This will be most pronounced in mountainous and steeply sloped areas, such as the border area of India and China, where landslides may increase by 30%-70% under 4.7 degrees Celsius of mean global warming,"" it said.","Climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could lead to a 16.9% loss in GDP by 2070 across the Asia and Pacific region.

KOLKATA: History sheets , voluminous registers kept at police stations, profiling criminals and their aides, will now have to wipe out names of minors, random inclusions of innocent people just because they are socially and economically backward. The pre-Independence Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, will now be amended after Supreme Court spelt out five-point guidelines in a case involving Delhi Police to maintain history sheets, and asked states to replicate ""Delhi model"".It has also stressed that these will be internal police documents which can never be made public.Pursuant to a May 7 order by the SC, the Bengal Police on October 24 issued guidelines on ""disclosing identities of individuals connected with the offender in the history sheet"". The new guidelines stop random inclusion of names in the history sheet and make it clear only those people will be named in the history sheets who can aid and shelter a criminal on the run. Names of minors have to be wiped out, even if they are in conflict with law or child witnesses.Importantly, the new guidelines bar police from ""mechanical entries"" of innocents just because they are poor, uneducated and happen to belong from backwards classes, SCs or STs. It also makes it clear that the history sheet is an ""internal police document"" and not a ""publicly accessible report"".According to the regulation 401 (a) PRB 1943, the history sheet is defined as: ""History sheets shall contain a short account of the life of the person to whom they relate and all facts likely to have a bearing on his criminal history. They shall be opened only for persons who are, or are likely to become, habitual criminals or the aiders or abettors of such criminals.""The SC directions were made in a case titled Amanatullah Khan versus Commissioner of Police, Delhi. Khan had moved court asking his history sheet to be deleted.

"Punjab mopped up Rs 2 crore in farm fire penalties, Haryana Rs 21 lakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-mopped-up-rs-2-crore-in-farm-fire-penalties-haryana-rs-21-lakh/articleshow/116027163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab and Haryana govts have, so far, this year imposed a cumulative penalty of over Rs 2.1 crore and Rs 21 lakh, respectively, on farmers for stubble burning and collected more than 50% of these amounts from violators.Sharing the data in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, the environment ministry in response to a Parliament question informed the House that Punjab reported 10,909 fire incidents this year as on November 30 whereas Haryana reported 1,406 such cases during the period, and the authorities have inspected nearly all the fields before imposing environmental compensation (penalty) in 5,525 and 638 cases, respectively.The ministry had last month doubled the penalty for burning paddy straw by farmers.Under the new rules, the farmers having farmland of less than two acres will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000 per incidence if they are found to be indulged in stubble burning. On the other hand, those having two acres or more but less than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 10,000 per incidence whereas those having more than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 30,000 per incidence.Though the state governments had imposed penalty in higher number of cases in the past in commensurate with reporting of quite a high number of stubble burning episodes in both Punjab and Haryana, the reported decline in the farm fires numbers this year could be a result of gradual strengthening of both in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw through various measures.Past data shows that the Punjab government had collected Rs 3.1 crore, Rs 2.8 crore and Rs 1.7 crore from 12,106 cases; 10,244 cases and 6,695 cases in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The state had reported 83,002; 71,304 and 49,922 incidents of farm fires in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.Similarly, the Haryana government had also collected a much higher amount as penalty from a higher number of cases in the past. The state had reported 4,202 incidents of stubble burning in 2020 and collected Rs 86 lakh as penalty from 464 cases.","Punjab reported 10,909 fire incidents this year as on November 30.

'Jatha' of 101 farmers to march towards Delhi today: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jatha-of-101-farmers-to-march-towards-delhi-today-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/116025672.cms,"(PTI photo)

Here's all you need to know about farmer's march to national capital:



Farmers under the banners of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have announced a foot march to the national capital.

""The 'jatha' of 101 farmers will march towards Delhi (on Friday). What the government will do is for them to decide. We will begin our march towards Delhi at 1 pm from the Shambhu border,"" said farmer leader Pandher.

Police have set up multi-layer barricading at the Ambala-Delhi border and deployed central paramilitary forces. Senior officers are monitoring the situation, with heightened vigilance reported since Thursday.

The farmers’ march coincides with the 297th day of their broader protest against the government. Meanwhile, an indefinite hunger strike by farmers at the Khanauri border has entered its 11th day.

Earlier on Thursday, 34 farmers were detained in Noida while attempting to reach Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal from point zero, without permission.

The Noida police confirmed that the detained farmers were taken into custody and sent to jail.

This is the second such march planned this week. On Monday, farmers from Uttar Pradesh attempted to march toward Parliament but were stopped at the Noida border, causing significant traffic disruptions.

What are the key demands of the farmers marching to Delhi?



NEW DELHI: Security has been heightened along the Ambala-Delhi border as farmer prepare to march to national capital on Friday. The march, led by a 'jatha' of 101 farmers is scheduled to begin at 1pm from the Shambhu Border.The Ambala district administration has invoked prohibitory orders under 'Section 163' of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), prohibiting any unlawful assembly of five or more people and banning processions by foot, vehicles, or other means. These restrictions will remain in effect until further notice.According to deputy commissioner’s orders, any public gathering or movement must have prior approval, prompting the administration to urge farmers to reconsider their march.Also read: Noida-to-Delhi feels pain of ‘farm fire’ Also read: Noida police arrests 34 farmers from Zero Point The farmers are pressing for a legal guarantee of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops among other demands.Their list of demands also includes a freeze on electricity tariff hikes, justice for the victims of the 2021 Lakhimpur Kheri violence , and additional reforms to improve the livelihoods of farmers and laborers.Meanwhile, farmers in Noida and Greater Noida have highlighted their distinct grievances tied to land acquisition. Since the initial acquisitions in 1997 for industrial development, they have sought 10% of abadi plots or equivalent compensation for their lands.","Police have set up multi-layer barricading at the Ambala-Delhi border and deployed central paramilitary forces.

Study ties C-section deliveries to income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-ties-c-section-deliveries-to-income/articleshow/116025729.cms,"Only 6% of women belonging to the lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section in public hospitals, the study shows

NEW DELHI: More women from high-income quintiles are undergoing delivery through caesarean section (Csection), even in govt hospitals, according to a new study.A wealth quintile is a statistical value that divides a population into five equally sized groups based on wealth, with each quintile representing 20% of the population.Only about 6% women belonging to lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section delivery in public hospitals across India. The rest went for normal delivery, according to the study published in Lancet Regional Health-Southeast Asia, which is based on a cross-sectional analysis of C-section delivery rate data published in National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) report.The percentage of women undergoing C-section delivery at public hospitals in the poorer, middle, richer and the richest categories stood at 11%, 18%, 21% and 25%, of total births in the respective wealth quintile, it stated. A C-section delivery is a surgical technique that involves making an incision in the belly to deliver one or more infants. When medically justified, the procedure can be lifesaving. However, when not strictly necessary, it can cause adverse health outcomes, lead to unnecessary expenditure, and place a strain on scarce public health resources.Dr Anita Gadgil, co-corresponding authors of the study, told TOI that one of the major reasons for lower rate of Csection delivery among the poor even in public health facilities, where the procedure is carried out free of cost, could be lack of awareness.“Also, sometimes the poorer women aren’t able to reach higher centres in time where C-section delivery is available, or they don’t have money and wherewithal to reach there. These people are often also least aware of govt schemes to provide financial support in such cases,” Dr Gadgil said.The study stated that while southern states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have high C-section delivery rates (up to 60%), states with a predominantly poor quintile population like Bihar, Assam and Chhattisgarh have lower C-section rates.Dr Gadgil, who works at George Institute for Global Health, said low rates indi cate that women requiring the procedure may not have adequate access, resulting in maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. On the other hand, high rates are suggestive of overuse without medical necessity, which is associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes and misallocation of resources, she added.A study carried out by researchers from IIT-Madras recently revealed that prevalence of C-sections across India increased from 17% to 21.5% from 2016 to 2021. In the private sector, these numbers stand at 43% (2016) and 50% (2021), meaning that nearly one in two deliveries in the private sector is a C-section.Researchers found better-educated women living in urban areas were more likely to deliver by C-section, suggesting that greater autonomy and better access to healthcare facilities play a role in increase in prevalence of C-sections.","Only about 6% women belonging to lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section delivery in public hospitals across India.

New aviation bill passed after heated debate over Hindi title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-aviation-bill-passed-after-heated-debate-over-hindi-title/articleshow/116025674.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Parliament on Thursday passed the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024 — a bill that replaces the Aircraft Act, 1934 — to improve ease of doing business in the fast-growing aviation sector.The bill was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. It was approved by Lok Sabha in the previous session in Aug.The debate on the bill in RS saw the name of the legislation in Hindi become a point of heated discussion with members of certain opposition parties objecting to it. BJP netas refuted the charge, alleging that the reaction of the opposition members reflects their “colonial mindset”.YSRCP’s S Niranjan Reddy asked govt to reconsider the nomenclature of the bill and said he was saying so not because he is opposing “Hindi imposition” but because there is a constitutional requirement. CPI’s Sandosh Kumar P also demanded that the title of the bill be amended, claiming that it is in contravention of the Constitution. TMC’s Sagarika Ghose and DMK’s Kanimozhi NVN Somu also opposed the bill’s name.Replying to the debate, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said there was no violation of any Constitutional rule in the change in title of the bill from English to Hindi. He added that it was done to “showcase India’s heritage and culture”.Responding to concerns of some MPs over skyrocketing airfares, Naidu said, “Through the Udan scheme, we have kind of addressed the accessibility. We are now addressing the affordability factor.” He said under the scheme, 609 routes were started in eight years.",The bill was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

The second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is set to begin on December 6th at the Adelaide Oval, with India facing Australia. India currently lead the five-match series 1-0, following their impressive 295-run victory in Perth.This Adelaide Test, like the corresponding fixture in the 2020/21 BGT series, will be a day-night affair. As preparation, India participated in an unofficial two-day match against the Prime Minister’s XI. Due to rain interruptions, the match was shortened to a 50-over contest, which India won by six wickets.The 2020/21 BGT series also began in Adelaide, marking India's first day-night Test match away from home. India, under Virat Kohli's captaincy, won the toss and opted to bat first.Despite early dismissals of openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal, India managed a first-innings total of 244. Kohli led the scoring with 74, supported by Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, who both contributed scores in the 40s.The Indian bowlers then delivered a strong performance, limiting Australia to 191. R. Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers, securing four wickets, while Jasprit Bumrah added three.India held a 53-run lead going into their second innings, but what followed was a dramatic collapse. They were bowled out for a shocking 36, their lowest-ever Test score. Josh Hazlewood produced a devastating spell, taking five wickets, and Pat Cummins claimed four.Australia needed only 90 runs to win, and they achieved victory comfortably despite losing two wickets. Joe Burns anchored the chase with an unbeaten fifty, securing a 1-0 series lead for Australia in the four-match series.India will be looking to maintain their series lead, while Australia aims to level the series in Adelaide. The day-night format adds another layer of complexity to this crucial encounter. Recalling the previous day-night Test at the same venue will undoubtedly be on the minds of both teams.India's dramatic collapse in their second innings during that match will serve as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the pink ball under lights. Conversely, Australia will draw confidence from their dominant performance in that match, especially their bowlers' ability to exploit the conditions.The Adelaide Oval has historically been a good batting track, but the day-night conditions can introduce unpredictable swing, making it challenging for batsmen, especially during the twilight period. The pink ball also behaves differently compared to the red ball, tending to swing more and offer more assistance to the bowlers. This element of unpredictability adds to the excitement and makes the upcoming Test match a highly anticipated contest. Both teams boast strong bowling attacks, and the battle between bat and ball under lights promises to be captivating.The second Test between India and Australia will begin on December 6 (Friday).The second Test between India and Australia will be played at the Adelaide Oval in a day-night format.The second India vs Australia Test will begin at 9:30am IST (2:30pm local time, 3pm AEDT, 4am GMT, 11pm EST and 8pm PST on December 5).

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

A well-planned deception



The crime scene and method: Throats slit, stab wounds



A boxer with grudge



Digital footprints under scrutiny



NEW DELHI: In a chilling case that has shocked the capital, a 20-year-old Delhi University student, Arjun Tanwar , has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer , his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai .The murders, committed early Wednesday—his parents’ wedding anniversary—were allegedly driven by a deep-seated grudge over property disputes and familial resentment. Police say Arjun carefully planned the crime, even attempting to mislead authorities by feigning innocence.According to investigators, Arjun believed his father, Rajesh Kumar (51), was planning to transfer their family property to his sister, Kavita (23).This, combined with his father’s stern disapproval of Arjun’s boxing ambitions and repeated public humiliation, ignited his fury.“He told us he opted for slitting their throats as he knew it would prevent them from screaming. He was so enraged with his father that he stabbed him in the head,” said the police.Arjun followed his regular routine, heading out for an early morning run at 5.30 am to stage a facade of normalcy.Upon returning, he ran to his gym and informed the owner that his parents had been murdered. He then alerted neighbours and relatives in a bid to avert suspicion.However, a police investigation uncovered inconsistencies in his account. ""When we questioned Arjun, he started giving different answers and there were multiple contradictions,"" said Sanjay Kumar Jain, joint commissioner of police (South).Rajesh’s lifeless body was discovered upstairs, while his wife Komal (46) and daughter Kavita were found in separate rooms on the ground floor.The victims bore horrifying injuries—throats slit, stab wounds aplenty. In a grim detail, clothing had been placed around their necks, likely in an attempt to stem the flow of blood.Arjun reportedly began his killing spree with his sister, who tried to fight back, as evidenced by the injuries on her body.He then moved to his father, attacking him in his sleep. Lastly, his mother, who had gone to the bathroom, was ambushed as she returned.Arjun used his father’s Army knife to carry out the murders, a weapon chosen for its lethal precision.Arjun, a political science student and a trained boxer who had won a silver medal representing Delhi, harboured a profound grudge against his family.He resented his father for supporting his sister, who was pursuing a master’s degree and for frequently reprimanding him about his studies and routine.“Arjun felt neglected and isolated,” police revealed. “He also suspected his father planned to hand over their property to his sister.”Rajesh’s treatment of Arjun, including physical reprimands in public, further fuelled his rage. Sources disclosed that tensions escalated during his sister’s birthday on December 1, when Rajesh allegedly assaulted him again.Police are now examining Arjun’s digital devices to determine if he sought inspiration online to execute the heinous crime.The case, cracked by a team under ACP Abhinendra Jain, exposes the chilling depths of resentment and anger that culminated in a tragedy tearing apart an unsuspecting family.","Arjun Tanwar, 20, has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer, his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai.

'Maha' drama over role reversal: How ex-CM Eknath Shinde played hardball before taking oath as deputy to Devendra Fadnavis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-drama-over-role-reversal-how-ex-cm-eknath-shinde-played-hardball-before-taking-oath-as-deputy-to-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/116012057.cms,"(From left) Deputy CM Eknath Shinde, CM Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar

NEW DELHI: The Mahayuti 2.0 government is finally in office with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis back as Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde and NCP chief Ajit Pawar as deputy chief ministers. The Mahayuti trio took oath at a glittering ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This marked the end of a 12-day-long political drama that gripped the state despite a sweeping mandate to the ruling coalition.With 230 seats in 288-member Maharashtra assembly, Mahayuti's return to power should have been smooth. But that was not to be. The run up to government formation after results were out on November 23 saw intense drama and hectic lobbying after outgoing chief minister Eknath Shinde insisted on a second term as the leader of the coalition.Soon after the numbers were out, the Shiv Sena launched an orchestrated campaign demanding a second term for Shinde as Mahayuti chief minister. This despite the fact that Sena had won only 57 seats, which was less than half of BJP's record tally of 132.Sena leaders put up posters, tweaked PM Modi's slogan ""Ek hain to safe hain"" to say ""Ek(nath) hain to safe hain"" and also cited the Bihar model of power sharing where Nitish Kumar is the chief minister despite being a junior partner to the BJP - to push Shinde's candidature for the top job.However, nothing worked as BJP, with just 13 seats short of a majority, was firm on leading the government this time around. In 2022, Shinde was given the top post by the BJP after he rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray to split the Shiv Sena and pave the way for the return of the NDA government in the state.After four days, Shinde relented by hinting that he was ready to give up his claim for the top post and would abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Mahayuti's CM-pick. Shinde claimed that his two-and-a-half-year tenure was historic and the work done was equivalent to 10 years of governance.The three Mahayuti leaders then met Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda in the national capital to discuss the power-sharing formula. It was after this meeting that Shinde once again went incommunicado.He made a sudden trip to his native village leading to the cancellation of scheduled meeting in Mumbai. Shiv Sena leaders offered different versions of his sudden village visit adding to the suspense. Some said he was unwell, while others claimed that he had gone there to take a big decision.After two days of village stay, Shinde returned to Mumbai and announced a new date for the meeting of Mahayuti leaders. However, this meeting also had to be cancelled as Shinde this time went to his house in Thane citing ill-health.With Shinde refusing to budge, the BJP unilaterally announced the date of the oath-taking ceremony, putting pressure on Shinde. It appointed central observers and fixed the date for the meeting of legislature party to formally elect Devendra Fadnavis for the post of chief minister.Left with no option, Shinde finally returned from Thane after a brief stopover at a hospital for medical tests. Subsequently, Fadnavis visited Shinde's official residence to discuss the modalities of the new government.However, the drama was far from over. While Shinde accepted Fadnavis as the leader of the Mahayuti, he did not clear the air about his future role.When the three leaders went to meet governor CP Radhakrishnan, Fadnavis revealed that Shinde was still not decided about joining the government as deputy chief minister. It was only a couple of hours before the swearing-in ceremony that Shinde finally put an end to this suspense as he announced that he would be taking oath as deputy chief minister.Shinde is now in the government as a deputy of Fadnavis. But is the power-sharing crisis over? Well, we do not know as the portfolio division is still not official and Shiv Sena leaders have openly demanded home ministry for Eknath Shinde.",Mahayuti 2.0 government is finally in office with Devendra Fadnavis back as Maharashtra chief minister. Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde and NCP chief Ajit Pawar are deputy chief ministers.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde on Thursday congratulated Devendra Fadnavis for taking oath as the chief minister of the state for the third time with a paradigm-shattering mandate .Shinde, who switched roles with Fadnavis in an opulent oath-taking ceremony at Mumbai's Azad Maidan, said that earlier when he was CM he considered himself a common man but now that he was deputy CM, he would consider himself a ""dedicated to common man"".""Devendra Fadnavis has taken oath as CM in a historic swearing-in ceremony. I congratulate him. Maharashtra is a state that gives ideological direction to the country and I, who comes from a simple farmer family, got the opportunity to become the CM of such a state...PM Narendra Modi also supported us completely, gave us full strength. Union home minister Amit Shah also stood behind us with full strength...And that is why we could do so much work in 2.5 years,"" Shinde said in his first statement after the state Cabinet meeting.Recounting his work as CM in the past two-and-hour years, Shinde said: ""We have taken so many historic decisions. This will be written in golden letters. I had said that in this election, we will see the result of the 2.5 year tenure of the government, we will get the blessings of the people. I am also happy that when we started, 2.5 years ago, 40 people were with us, today 60 people are there. Earlier I used to consider myself as a common man, not a chief minister, now as DCM, I consider myself dedicated to common man... I will fully support the CM and cooperate with him.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the oath-taking ceremony, which also saw Ajit Pawar from the NCP and former CM Eknath Shinde from Shiv Sena taking oath as deputy chief ministers.The oath was administered by Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan.This is the third time Fadnavis, who represents Nagpur as an MLA, has assumed the role of Maharashtra chief minister. The event followed two weeks of discussions after thestate assembly elections held on November 20, with results announced on November 23.Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, BJP president J P Nadda were among the political heavyweights present during the event. The oath-taking ceremony was also attended by prominent industrialists, including Mukesh Ambani and Kumar Mangalam Birla. Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and actors Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, and Ranveer Singh were also present at the event.The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats in the 288-member House. Together with its allies, Shiv Sena and NCP, the BJP-led Mahayuti coalition has a majority of 230 seats.","Devendra Fadnavis takes oath as chief minister of Maharashtra for the third time.

(PTI)

NEW DELHI: Amruta Fadnavis , wife of Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, credited her husband’s political success to his patience and perseverance as he assumed office as CM for the third time following the BJP’s landslide victory in the Maharashtra assembly polls.""Patience and perseverance are the main qualities that have taken Devendra Fadnavis to where he is,"" she told reporters on Thursday, expressing happiness at his sixth consecutive term as an MLA and his third stint as chief minister. However, she stressed the heavy responsibility of fulfilling the government’s mandate.Fadnavis, who previously served as CM from 2014 to 2019, had famously coined the slogan "" Me Punha Yein "" (I will come back again) during the 2019 assembly elections. Despite securing 105 seats, the BJP’s fallout with the Shiv Sena kept him from reclaiming the top post, though he briefly held an 80-hour term with Ajit Pawar as deputy.He faced further challenges in 2022 when the Maha Vikas Aghadi government fell, and Eknath Shinde took the chief minister’s position, relegating Fadnavis to the deputy CM role.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh has urgently recalled the mission heads of Agartala and Kolkata high commissions to Dhaka, a move that would further deepen the ongoing tension between the interim-Yunus government and New Delhi.The acting deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh in Kolkata, Shikdar Md Ashrafur Rahman, and the assistant high commissioner in Tripura, Arifur Rahman, were instructed to return to Dhaka on an urgent basis last Tuesday, reported Prothom Alo citing sources.While the mission head of Kolkata turned to Dhaka, his Tripura mission colleague will soon leave for Bangladesh.This comes a day after demonstrators allegedly broke into the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala to protest atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.The high commission breach comes after an Agartala-Kolkata bus travelling via Dhaka on Saturday reportedly faced an attack in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh after being involved in an accident on Vishwa Road.The breach came amid escalating tensions between India and Bangladesh, exacerbated by rising attacks on Hindus and their places of worship in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this year.The political instability in Bangladesh has coincided with a series of mob attacks, intensifying concerns for the safety of the Hindu minority community. The tension rose further after the arrest of prominent Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , a vocal advocate for minority rights.Das was detained at Dhaka airport in October on charges of allegedly disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally. The specifics of the allegations remain vague, and Das has been denied bail.",Bangladesh has urgently recalled the mission heads of Agartala and Kolkata high commissions to Dhaka.

Ambitions vs reality

A family rift and a costly gamble

From cooperative politics to state leader

The road ahead

NEW DELHI: In a career marked by dramatic turns, NCP chief Ajit Pawar has once again proven his resilience by becoming Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister for the sixth time. Taking the oath on Thursday at a grand ceremony in Mumbai, the 65-year-old leader fortified his position in state politics, stepping out of the shadow of his uncle, NCP founder Sharad Pawar , more than a year after rebelling against him.A seasoned politician, Ajit Pawar has never hidden his desire to become the chief minister. Yet, the title continues to elude him, earning him the moniker ""forever Deputy CM"" among detractors. Despite such jibes, his political maneuvering since 2019 has solidified his role as one of Maharashtra's most adaptable leaders.Reflecting on the leadership reshuffle, political analyst Suhas Palshikar observed, ""Ajit Pawar's survival instincts are unparalleled. Even when cornered, he has an uncanny ability to turn challenges into opportunities, as seen in his post-2019 trajectory.""In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, Ajit Pawar risked a significant family divide by fielding his wife, Sunetra Pawar, against his cousin Supriya Sule in the Baramati Lok Sabha polls. The gamble backfired, with Sunetra losing to Sule, a setback that many saw as a dent in his political acumen. Later, Ajit Pawar admitted the move was a mistake.Despite this, Ajit Pawar retained his hold on Baramati in the assembly elections, even with Sharad Pawar campaigning aggressively against him. His faction of the NCP secured 41 out of 59 seats it contested, a stark contrast to the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), which struggled in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Ajit Pawar’s journey began in 1982 when he was elected to the board of a sugar cooperative. Over the years, he carved a niche for himself in Maharashtra’s political and cooperative landscape, holding portfolios such as irrigation, finance, and water resources. He became an MLA in 1991 and has represented Baramati ever since.In 2019, Ajit Pawar briefly broke away from the NCP, forming a government with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. The government collapsed within three days, yet Ajit Pawar emerged stronger, later serving as Deputy CM in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and subsequently joining the Shinde-BJP alliance in 2023.With a firm grip on the NCP name and its iconic ""clock"" symbol, Ajit Pawar has not only outmaneuvered his uncle but also positioned himself as a pivotal player in Maharashtra’s political chessboard. However, his critics continue to question whether his ambitions will ever culminate in him leading the state as Chief Minister.For now, Ajit Pawar stands tall as Maharashtra’s political survivor, proving that adaptability and resilience are as critical as ambition in the game of power.","Ajit Pawar has been Maharashtra's deputy chief minister for the sixth time.

NEW DELHI: A 'Jatha' (group) of 101 farmers will march to Delhi on Friday at 1 PM from the Shambhu border protest site, according to farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher.Pandher addressed reporters, saying that the march will proceed peacefully as planned. ""The jatha will leave from here (for Delhi) tomorrow at 1 PM. I hope the government sends a positive message and does not obstruct us. With the barricading being done, it feels as though this has become an international border,"" Pandher was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.However, the Ambala district administration has imposed restrictions under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), banning gatherings of five or more people and processions without prior permission.The deputy commissioner’s order prohibits any assembly or procession on foot, vehicles, or other means, citing concerns over potential disruptions to public order. The restrictions, effective from November 30, will remain in place until further notice. It exempts police and public servants on duty for law and order.Pandher, meanwhile, said that the farmers’ march is within their rights, noting, “If we go to Delhi on foot, there should be no reason to stop the farmers.""The farmers, under the banners of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha , began their protests at the Shambhu and Khanauri borders on February 13 after being stopped from marching to Delhi. Their demands include a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP), farm debt waivers, pensions for farmers and laborers, and withdrawal of police cases against farmers. They are also seeking compensation for farmers who died during the 2020-21 protests and reinstatement of the Land Acquisition Act, of 2013.Pandher criticized the authorities’ measures, comparing the border restrictions to an international boundary, saying, “They are treating us like we are enemies from some other country.” He said the first group of 101 farmers, called 'Marjeevda Jatha,' would begin the march, with other groups following later.The farmers have dedicated the march to Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's martyrdom, which will also be observed on Friday at the Shambhu and Khanauri border points.Meanwhile, farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal continued his fast-unto-death protest at the Khanauri border. Punjab police officials also met farmer leaders on Thursday, who assured them the march would remain peaceful and would not involve tractor-trolleys.Pandher said talks with the government could happen only if initiated by the Centre or the chief ministers of Punjab or Haryana. He added, ""If the Haryana government uses force to stop the march, it will expose their intent.""The demands of the farmers also include no increase in electricity tariffs, ""justice"" for victims of the 2021 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, and other reforms to support farmers and laborers.Meanwhile, vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday called for the government to engage in discussions with distressed farmers.Speaking at the Centenary Foundation Day event of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research - Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology (ICAR-CIRCOT) in Mumbai, Dhankhar addressed Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and raised questions about prior commitments to farmers. ""Honourable agriculture minister, did previous agriculture ministers make any written commitments? If so, what became of them?"" he asked.The VP expressed concern over the situation of farmers, saying, ""India has never had such a strong standing in the world. Our global reputation has never been higher. Yet, amidst this progress, why are our farmers in distress? Why are they suffering? Why are they stressed?""He pressed on the importance of addressing farmers’ issues, stating, ""Dismissing their concerns lightly shows a lack of practicality and ineffective policymaking.

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges.

'Exempt us from deploying CAT II/III planes at Bangalore & Kolkata': Akasa to DGCA; else warns of 'disruptions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/exempt-us-from-deploying-cat-ii/iii-planes-at-bangalore-kolkata-akasa-to-dgca-else-warns-of-disruptions/articleshow/115980819.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its pilot training troubles, Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions along with pilots trained to do so at Bengaluru and Kolkata for flights to operate from 9 pm to early morning. The almost 2.5-year-old airline has warned of “significant disruptions” at these airports and causing hardship to passengers.Following the early onset of fog this unusually warm winter, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) had last month made it mandatory for airlines to deploy aircraft with CATII/III landing and low visibility take off (LVTO) systems along with pilots trained on the same on night to morning flights at airports like Delhi, Amritsar, Jaipur, Lucknow, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Akasa, which has over 840 pilots for its current fleet of 26 Boeing 737 MAX planes, has been facing pilot training issues and sources say the required number of trained pilots are not available with them for CAT III landings at their Bangalore base.The airline is already under scanner when DGCA has red-flagged this in the recent past. The regulator had recently issued Akasa a show cause for alleged training lapses, including wrong minima certification of a simulator on which some pilots were trained to operate in low visibility. So, while the airline has the required number of low visibility operation compliant planes and crew to cover north India operations, doing so in Kolkata and Bengaluru is proving to be challenging this winter.While Akasa did not comment on this issue, airline sources said: “CAT (II/III) trainings as required by the regulator are typically achieved in a phased manner, as an airline progresses in its operations from inception. Akasa has been working closely with the DGCA and aims to train the requisite number of CAT3 compliant pilots in a timely manner as mandated by the regulator. Akasa has ensured it protects all fog-prone destinations along the northern region of its network.”“In public interest and keeping in mind the safety and security of passengers, DGCA has correctly extended this mandate nationwide. As there is a variance in topography of southern and northern states, Bengaluru will be impacted differently than Delhi, and this is the area in which Akasa will now work to enhance its capabilities and ensure it flies within regulations while providing a reliable and efficient experience to its customers,” Akasa sources said.The “traditional” fog window is Dec 10 to Feb 10 but this year while temperatures are yet to dip, low visibility made its debut early Nov itself. The DGCA then preponed its fog window and asked airlines to deploy aircraft II/III-compliant aircraft with pilots trained to land in low visibility at many airports.",Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Thursday said Mahayuti’s thumping win in Maharashtra was made possible by a team effort by BJP and its allies Shiv Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party.“This team is a blend of experience and dynamism, and it is due to this team’s collective efforts that the Mahayuti has got a historic mandate in Maharashtra. This team will do everything possible to fulfil the aspirations of the people of the state and to ensure there is good governance,” Modi said on X (formerly Twitter) as he congratulated newly sworn-in CM Devendra Fadnavis and his two deputies — Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.The remark was being seen in political circles as significant, given that in terms of numbers BJP is ahead of its allies by a mile and almost in a position to form govt on its own. It was seen as aimed at outgoing CM Shinde, in particular, who struggled to come to terms with his “demotion”, besides signalling the intent to take the two alliance partners along.Modi also assured all possible support from the Centre for Maharashtra’s development.In the November 20 elections to the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, BJP bagged 132 assembly seats, the highest among all constituents of the Mahayuti alliance . Shinde’s Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP also performed well, bagging 57 & 41 seats, respectively.","PM Narendra Modi said Mahayuti’s thumping win in Maharashtra was made possible by a team effort by BJP and its allies Shiv Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar.

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis ’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stating he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs reached Raj Bhavan only at 2.30 pm Thursday, barely three hours before the actual swearing-in, as there was uncertainty until afternoon about whether Eknath Shinde would agree to be sworn in as deputy CM.Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Shinde till Thursday morning; Shinde has been insisting on portfolios of his choice. However, in the morning, Shiv Sena ’s Uday Samant, Bharat Gogawale, Ravi Phatak and Sanjay Shirsat persuaded him to join the government as deputy CM, stating that the row over allotment of portfolios could be resolved at a later stage. Following their marathon meeting, Shinde agreed to take oath as deputy CM and a letter signed by Shinde was given to Fadnavis.It was then that Fadnavis sent his letter to the governor. Fadnavis could have sent his own name and that of Ajit Pawar on his own to the governor, but he waited for Shinde’s confirmation, sources said.Atop bureaucrat told TOI that the oath-taking event was confirmed only after written communication was received from CM-designate Fadnavis stating he along with Shinde and Ajit would take oath.Elaborating on what had happened earlier, the bureaucrat said that after the meeting of BJP legislature party Wednesday, a delegation comprising Shinde, Ajit and Fadnavis had called on the governor to stake claim for forma tion of the government. The delegation submitted a list of 237 MLAs supporting the Mahayuti. In addition, separate letters were given by BJP legislature party, Shiv Sena legislature party and NCP legislature party pledging support to Mahayuti government. Shinde and Ajit had earlier been elected as legislature party leaders of Sena and NCP, respectively.But in view of reservations expressed by Shinde over portfolios, no letter was given to Raj Bhavan stating Fadnavis would be leader of Mahayuti legislature party. During the interaction with media in the presence of Fadnavis and Ajit, Shinde was non-committal on whether he would join Mahayuti government as deputy CM. “There is no hurry, media will know by evening,” Shinde had said when asked if he would take oath as deputy CM.Sources said Shinde was hopeful he would get the portfolios of his choice and he was reluctant to join the government as deputy CM in the absence of any assurances in this regard.“All formalities were completed after Raj Bhavan received Fadnavis’s letter around 2.30pm, and the oathtaking took place as scheduled. Certainly it was a piquant situation, but there was no embarrassment, and the event passed off peacefully,” the bureaucrat added.Later at a presser, Fadnavis said about Shinde, “I am telling you 100% he wasn’t upset. Once I appealed to him, he accepted. When I was asked to be deputy CM after being CM, I was also reluctant. But I understood that without taking the post in an alliance government, there is a lack of coordination between the party & the government.”",Devendra Fadnavis’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stated he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs. Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Eknath Shinde till Thursday morning.

"After 18 days of severe curbs, SC allows lifting of Grap-4",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-18-days-of-severe-curbs-sc-allows-lifting-of-grap-4/articleshow/116025269.cms,"Pollution

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday allowed easing of stringent anti-pollution curbs under Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) Stage 4 in NCR, and replacing these with Grap-2 measures. However, it said Grap-3 should be imposed immediately if AQI goes above 350 and Grap-4 should kick in if it crosses 400.Grap-4 was imposed in NCR on Nov 18 when airpollution reached ‘severe plus’ levels with AQI above 450. During the last 18 days, AQI had been improving but the court had turned down repeated requests to relax curbs and had said it would do so only when there was a steady downward trend in pollution levels.Noting that AQI had continuously improved in the last few days, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih allowed the plea of Commission for Air Quality Management ( CAQM ) for relaxation.Appearing for CAQM, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the SC bench that pollution had come down and that restrictions imposed under Grap-4 were devastating for many people.Allowing the plea, the court left it for CAQM to decide whether some measures of GRAP-III could continue alongside GRAP-II curbs.“Up to Nov 30, AQI levels were consistently above 300 and it is only during the last four days that the levels have come down below 300. It is true that at some stage the court will have to leave it to the commission to decide the applicability of stages under GRAP. Considering the data before us, we do not think it will be appropriate at this stage to allow the commission to go below Stage II. So, we permit the commission to go to Stage II for the present. It will be appropriate if the commission considers incorporating certain additional measures which are part of Stage III. While we permit the commission to do so, we must record here that if the commission finds that the AQI goes above 350, as a precautionary measure, Stage III measures will have to be immediately implemented. If AQI crosses 400 on a given day, Stage IV measures will have to be reintroduced,” the bench said.The NCR witnessed 18 days of Grap-IVrestrictions during which construction work was banned and entry of goods trucks was also not allowed. Educational institutions were shut for a few days with only online classes being conducted. Later, SC allowed schools and colleges to operate in hybrid mode, with physical classes being supplemented with online lessons “wherever possible and required”.GRAP-II curbs are aimed to prevent further degradation of air quality and include a series of measures targeting pollution from various sources. Under it, there will be restrictions on the use of coal and firewood as well as diesel generator sets in NCR.Mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on identified roads will be carried out on a daily basis, and dust control measures will be enforced at construction and demolition sites. Traffic personnel have to be deployed at congestion points, vehicle parking fees could be increased to discourage private transport and additional bus and Metro services will be started.","Grap-4 was imposed in NCR on Nov 18 when airpollution reached ‘severe plus’ levels with AQI above 450.

NEW DELHI: Using its omnibus power under Article 142 of the Constitution, Supreme Court on Thursday annulled the marriage between a non-Dalit woman and a Dalit man, and ordered the husband to get Scheduled Caste certificates for their minor children, who have been with their mother for the last six years.The rationale behind this order from Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan, while granting divorce to Juhi Poria nee Jawalkar and Pradip Poria, was that though a non-Dalit woman cannot acquire membership of a Scheduled Caste community through marriage, her children born to a Scheduled Caste man would be entitled to the SC tag.The SC has reiterated this principle in many judgments and had ruled in 2018, ""There cannot be any dispute that caste is determined by birth and caste cannot be changed by marriage with a person from Scheduled Caste (community). Merely because her husband belongs to a Scheduled Caste community, she could not be issued a Scheduled Caste certificate.""In the present case, the children - an 11-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter - have been residing with the non-Dalit woman at her parent's home in Raipur for the last six years, the period of the couple's estrangement. With the SC granting divorce, the children will continue to be groomed in a non-Dalit household and yet would be considered Scheduled Castes for the purpose of admissions to govt educational institutions and employment.The Justice Kant-led bench asked the husband to move the authorities concerned and get SC certificates for the two children within six months. It said he would bear all expenses of their education till post-graduation, including admission and tuition fees as well as boarding and lodging expenses.This is in addition to Rs 42 lakh paid by the man to the woman as a one-time settlement towards lifelong maintenance of the woman and the children. The man would also give a plot of land owned by him in Raipur to the woman.Interestingly, the bench also gave effect to a clause in the settlement between the estranged couple mandating the husband to buy her a two-wheeler for personal use by Aug 31 next year. The bench also quashed the cross-FIRs and cases lodged by the parties against each other.The SC directed the woman to facilitate periodic meetings of the children with their father, allow them to be taken on vacation by him and build a good relationship between them.","The children will be groomed in a non-Dalit household and yet would be considered SCs for admissions to educational institutions and employment.

NEW DELHI: Reaffirming India's long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict , external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday told Rajya Sabha that while countries have the right to respond to terrorism, they must also remain mindful of civilian casualties and humanitarian laws.Responding to a supplementary during question hour on the reason for India's abstention from a resolution in the UNGA on Oct 27, 2023, regarding the protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations, Jaishankar said the country voted or abstained on resolutions based on several considerations.""In this particular case, we felt that the resolution was not well-drafted and not well-considered. We had reservations on the language. Our concerns were not accommodated. That is why we abstained,"" Jaishankar said.""In the resolution, there was no reference to terrorism. There was no reference to hostage-taking. A country like India which is itself a victim of terrorism, if we countenance the fact that terrorism is underplayed and ignored, it is not in our interest that we do so.""On the country's position in the ongoing conflict, the minister said, ""We condemn terrorism, we condemn hostage-taking. We do believe countries have the right to respond to the situation but countries should be mindful of civilian casualties. They must observe humanitarian law and we would like a ceasefire and an early end to violence.""India has always supported a negotiated two-state solution, with a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living side by side in peace with Israel. ""We have been public and unambiguous about that. There should be no cause for confusion regarding the two-state solution.""Responding to another question on India's position on a ban imposed by Israel on UN aid agency UNRWA , Jaishankar said the government has stood by its decision to send humanitarian aid to Palestine and has just released the latest tranche of support to UNRWA."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar told Rajya Sabha that while countries have the right to respond to terrorism, they must also remain mindful of civilian casualties and humanitarian laws. He said India has always supported a negotiated two-state solution, with a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116022157,imgsize-948621,width-400,resizemode-4/116022157.jpg"

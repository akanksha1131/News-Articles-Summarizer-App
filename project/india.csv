Civil aviation minister of state Murlidhar Mohol on Saturday dismissed the foreign media reports about the Air India crash investigation in Ahmedabad that killed 260 people in June 2025, adding that the probe is still ongoing and no final conclusions have been reached.Mohol said, ""I just want to inform you all that our investigation agencies are probing the matter. Should we have faith in our own agencies or outsiders? Our agencies are working on it,"" he said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Mohol further reiterated on waiting for the final report before making any judgments. ""Once the final report is finalised, then only it will be justifiable to comment on it,"" he added, stressing the need to trust India's own investigation agencies rather than foreign media reports.This comes after an Italian media report blamed the pilots for the crash.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had also stepped in on Thursday to clarify the situation. They firmly stated that the investigation is still in progress. The AAIB also labeled media reports claiming the investigation's completion as ""incorrect and speculative.""The devastating accident occurred when Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft, bound for London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12, last year. The crash claimed 241 passenger lives along with 19 others, marking it as one of India's worst aviation disasters.",Civil aviation minister of state Murlidhar Mohol dismissed foreign media reports about the Air India crash investigation.

This week, it closed a corruption case that had dragged on for nearly 32 years - six years in trial court, 14 years in HC and 11 years in SC, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad on March 24, 1994. The trial court convicted the accused six years later on Apr 3, 2000. To concur with the trial court's decision, the Bombay HC took more than 14 years.On appeal, the case remained pending for a decade in the SC before getting listed for final hearing before a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan, which reserved the verdict on Aug 21 last year. On Friday, after nearly six months, Justice Mahadevan pronounced the judgment acquitting the accused.Justice Mahadevan said, “Both the trial court and the high court held that the appellants (accused) failed to furnish any satisfactory explanation or documentary justification for such possession (of cement bags). These findings are essentially factual and are supported by the evidence on record.”Despite the evidence against the accused, the bench of Justices Nagarathna and Mahadevan acquitted the accused saying the prosecution charged them under provisions of Essential Commodities Act when on the date of siphoning off cement, it was not a commodity covered under that law.“That said, this was a case where the investigating agency ought to have invoked appropriate provisions of the Indian Penal Code, having regard to the nature of the allegations and the evidence collected,” it said and acquitted the accused saying, “The lapse, therefore, lies squarely at the door of the investigating agency.”","The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad.

Absconders can't get anticipatory bail: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absconders-cant-get-anticipatory-bail-sc/articleshow/128369080.cms,"NEW DELHI: The SC has directed all high courts not to grant anticipatory bail to accused persons who abscond and later, after their co-accused are acquitted on completion of trial, approach constitutional courts seeking protection from arrest.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Vijay Bishnoi set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC order that granted anticipatory bail to the absconding accused, directed him to surrender and apply for regular bail. It frowned upon the HC's direction to the trial court to grant bail on the day the accused moves the bail plea.Justice Bishnoi, who wrote the judgment, said, “An absconder is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail as a general rule, however, in certain exceptional cases, where on a perusal of the FIR, case diary and other relevant materials on record, the court is of the prima facie opinion that no case is made out against the absconding accused, then the power of granting anticipatory bail may be exercised.”The court noted that the accused was part of a mob who had not only fled but also threatened to kill an injured person for opposing his bail plea. The bench said the acquittal of the co-accused thus could not be grounds to grant him anticipatory bail as he had failed to cooperate with probe and delayed the trial.“Granting the relief of anticipatory bail... sets a bad precedent and sends a message that the law-abiding co-accused persons who stood trial were wrong to diligently attend the process of trial and further, incentivises people to evade the process of law with impunity,” the SC said.The bench directed the accused to surrender before the trial court within four weeks and seek regular bail.",A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Vijay Bishnoi set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC order that granted anticipatory bail to the absconding accused.

Cabinet OKs India’s 1st underwater road-cum-rail tunnel in Assam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-oks-indias-1st-underwater-road-cum-rail-tunnel-in-assam/articleshow/128368829.cms,"PM Modi Opens Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu, Rs 3000 Crore Bridge Cuts Guwahati Travel Time To 7 Minutes

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved infrastructure projects worth over Rs 31,000 crore, including construction of the country’s first road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra in Assam. The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.It will connect Gohpur and Numaligarh in Assam and will cut travel time from about 6 hours to just 20 minutes. The project, to be fully funded by govt, will not just reduce the travel distance from 240 km to roughly 34 km improving connectivity but also has strategic significance, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said while announcing the Cabinet decision. This four-lane tunnel will ensure high-speed connectivity to Arunachal and provide “strategic resilience” for defence purposes. The minister said the twin tubes would be interconnected at intervals of 500 metres.Officials said the tunnel would be built around 32 metres beneath the Brahmaputra’s lowest bed level. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track and no vehicular movement will be allowed when trains run through this tube.PM Modi called the Brahmaputra tunnel project as a “landmark boost to connectivity in the northeast”.In a post on X, he said, “...This transformative project will enhance connectivity, reduce logistics costs and accelerate growth across Assam and the entire Northeast.”TOI has learnt that originally govt had included the connectivity between Gohpur and Numaligarh as a part of the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East in 2008 by constructing a bridge. But later a proposal was mooted to build a road tunnel beneath the Brahmaputra. Later, it was modified to have a common tunnel for both vehicles and trains.A similar 22-km road-cumrail tunnel passing through Chicken Neck corridor in the northeast is also in planning stage. Besides the tunnel, Cabinet approved three NH projects with a combined cost of over Rs 11,000 crore — a 107.7-km fourlane highway in Gujarat, a 154.6-km highway stretch in Maharashtra and an 80-km corridor of NH-167 in Telangana.In rail sector, three multitracking projects covering 12 districts across Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Karnataka were approved at an estimated cost of Rs 18,509 crore. The approved projects will add 389 km to the existing network of railways. Multitracking works are scheduled for completion by March 2031. These include the laying of third and fourth line between Kasara and Manmad in Maharashtra, which will have the second longest tunnel on the rail network.","The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.

Generative AI ups demand for skilled workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/generative-ai-ups-demand-for-skilled-workers-study/articleshow/128368504.cms,"India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

NEW DELHI: The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers, and provided “considerable stability” at senior level, an ICRIER study has said.“Researchers note this moderation aligns with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT industry and cannot be attributed to AI adoption alone. Roles commonly perceived as most exposed to AI, such as software developers and database administrators, are also among those experiencing the strongest growth in demand, indicating that generative AI is primarily functioning as a productivity-enhancing complement to technical and analytical work, rather than a substitute,” said the report, which was backed by OpenAI and based on a survey of over 650 firms.Roles such as statisticians and mathematicians, application developers and database designers and administrators were among the most exposed — and had the highest demand — while HR, legal and finance professionals were least. The most impacted roles and skills include data entry and clerical work, followed by manual testing, manual quality assurance, and entry level programming.Among business functions in IT companies, software development and engineering, followed by IT infra and cloud services and project management were seen to be the most affected, the survey showed.The report said AI adoption is reshaping hiring priorities toward hybrid skills profiles combining domain expertise and AI and data-related technical skills, instead of narrow specialisation.While half the companies surveyed said they were investing in internal awareness and workforce reskilling, the report said: “The cause for concern, however, is that IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations or expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling. The shortage of qualified AI trainers, limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed. ”","The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

Consumer forums can’t be sinecures for retired judges: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consumer-forums-cant-be-sinecures-for-retd-judges-sc/articleshow/128363327.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has taken exception to district and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and HC judges and admitted that the apex court had passed sweeping orders in the past for activating these forums without realising the pendency of cases in these institutions.A district consumer forum is headed by a retired district judge, and a state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) is headed by a retired HC judge. Most northeastern states and Union territories have complained that there is little work for the commissions and setting them up in full strength will be a drain on the exchequer.Arunachal Pradesh informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi on Feb 11 that it has a total of 59 consumer cases pending in district and state consumer forums. It said that it has advertised for post of president of the state consumer forum, but no retired judge is interested in taking up the assignment.A similar story emerged from other northeastern states and UTs. Sikkim has a total pendency of 64 consumer cases — 52 in district forums and 12 in state forum; Mizoram has 82 cases in district forums and 12 in state forum; Manipur has 123 cases in district forums and 43 in state forum; Lakshadweep has a total of 10 cases; Andaman and Nicobar islands has 37 cases in district forum and four in state forum; and Goa has a total pendency of 39 consumer cases.The bench agreed that creating separate district and state forums in states where pendency of consumer cases is low casts an unnecessary burden on the exchequer and the assignment becomes a sinecure for retired judicial officers and retired HC judges.Reflecting on past orders on the issue by SC, the CJI-led bench said, “We are also fond of issuing sweeping directions without realising the ground realities. The presidents of district consumer forums are on a par with district judges but look at the workload of the two. The district judges are overburdened whereas the consumer forums in these states have no work. Why should the president of a district forum be equated with a district judge?”Seeking data from all states on pendency of cases before district forums, the bench decided to deal with the state commissions in seven states/UTs where pendency is low and transferred the pending cases to the HCs concerned.It said the HC chief justice would assign consumer forum work to one of the judges, who would act as president of the forum and hear the cases along with members of the state forum. Those aggrieved by their orders could file an appeal before National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), the bench said. “States and UTs where pendency of consumer cases are less than 1,000 can submit an alternative proposal for the purpose of providing a mechanism to redress grievances of consumer complaints,” the bench said as some states wanted to appoint part-time members to district consumer forums.",District and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and HC judges.

NEW DELHI: Two journalist bodies on Saturday criticised Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for questioning the impartiality of mediapersons, saying political leaders must use respectful language while addressing the press, especially in public spaces like the Parliament.The reaction came after Gandhi, speaking to reporters outside the Parliament earlier in the week, asked journalists to be more objective in their coverage. Responding to queries on the treasury benches considering a privilege notice against him over his recent speech on the Budget, the LoP said media should not merely repeat what it is told.Condemning the remarks, National Union of Journalists and Delhi Journalists Association issued a joint statement calling Gandhi’s comments inappropriate. “The LoP targeting and insulting media personnel in such a manner is highly condemnable,” NUJ president Ras Bihar said. He added that such statements amount to an attack on press freedom and undermine the role of media in a democracy.DJA president Rakesh Thapliyal and general secretary Pramod Kumar Singh said journalism exists to question those in power and provide accurate information to the public. Associating the media with any particular political party, they said, harms the professional dignity and independence of journalists.Rahul Gandhi had told reporters, “You are not totally employed by BJP.

In Kuki villages, night patrols began almost immediately after clashes erupted on May 3, 2023. In Naga-majority ones, they intensified after tensions flared in Litan this week.Some of these youngsters were brought to Assam Rifles' New Keithelmanbi Garrison earlier this week after finishing guard duty that morning, reports Vishant Agarwala. They are footballers. From Monday to Thursday, 13 teams - eight Naga, three Meitei and two Kuki - from nearby villages gathered at the garrison's uneven, dusty football ground for Assam Rifles' Foothills Football Tournament, organised under Operation Sadbhavana.Keithelmanbi lies along the seam where the Imphal Valley rises into the surrounding hills, a geography that has hardened into buffer zones and guarded perimeters. The teams were named after nearby villages. But even a distance of 4km can carry more meaning than it suggests.The Kuki teams - including Haibung FC which reached Thursday's final - crossed the buffer zone for the first time since May 2023 in Assam Rifles buses with guards.Football has often mirrored deeper fractures within societies already under strain. The 1990 clash between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade came to symbolise Yugoslavia unravelling. The so-called ""Football War"" between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 entered history as an example of how a match can ignite terrain already primed for conflict. In those instances, football did not invent grievance, it amplified it.In Keithelmanbi, football was asked to restrain.The organisers approached the tournament with caution. Senior Assam Rifles officers addressed the teams before kickoff and made the terms clear: play in the spirit of the sport; any attempt to injure an opponent would result in an immediate red card; an extremely severe offence would lead to disqualification of the entire team.""Refereeing is always contentious, so we used soldiers from outside the northeast,"" an officer told TOI. Security personnel lined the perimeter. From the commentary area, a Hindi voice narrated play and returned to one appeal whenever tackles grew heavy: ""Khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein. Referee ke nirnay ka paalan karein."" Maintain the game's spirit. Referee's decision is final.The first semifinal at 8am on Wednesday featured two 100% Meitei teams - New Keithelmanbi Team B and KTYWA Keinou. The second carried a heavier backdrop. Khonglong Naga Youth Club faced Haibung FC.Days earlier, violence had flared between Kukis and Nagas about 100km away in Litan in Ukhrul district. Though Khonglong's village had not suffered direct damage, anxiety spread quickly. Naga youngsters too began night patrols. Families hesitated before allowing the team travel. ""People were worried,"" one Khonglong player said. ""But if we stop meeting completely, that is not good for the future.""On the pitch, there was no spillover. Haibung dominated in a largely one-sided contest. When the match ended, the handshake was steady and unforced. It set up a final few had predicted - the first Kuki-Meitei football match since May 3, 2023.Haibung's story explains why reaching the final carried weight beyond sport. The squad's average age is 19. Instead of focusing on training, many found themselves playing night sentries. ""For our own safety,"" one said. ""That doesn't mean we want to fight another community.""""We don't sleep properly on those days,"" another player said quietly. ""But it is our responsibility."" They were excused from duty for the duration of the tournament.Haibung coach Ngamgoulen (30) had returned from Delhi, where he had been preparing for the Manipur civil services exams, on April 28, 2023. Within weeks, his village was attacked five times. His cousin Nilson Kuki's house burned down. Movement became restricted. Reaching the nearest airport required crossing a buffer zone. With routes to Imphal airport blocked, residents travelled via Aizawl or Dimapur.Gogo, as he is known, did not leave his village. ""As the younger brother of the village chief, it was my duty to be there for my people."" His belongings remain in Delhi.Haibung defender Seiminthang Haokip (20) now lives in a relief camp after his village was burned down twice and is still waiting for the next stage of his Territorial Army application. Fullback Thangkhopao Singsit (21) had been preparing for CDS examinations when his village was attacked in July 2023, leaving three villagers dead and one still missing.Goalkeeper Chongouman Kipgen (21) ran a private school with his father that employed teachers from Meitei, Kuki, Naga and smaller tribes, and they were in the process of starting another school before the conflict made coexistence impossible. Midfielder Thangminsei Kipgen (19) teaches at the only functioning community-run school in the area, managed by Kuki Students' Organisation, after most qualified teachers left the state.By the time the final began, the stands were full. Villagers had been brought in Army vehicles under armed escort, joining elders and locals. Senior Assam Rifles officers were present.The first half was intense. New Keithelmanbi was in control. By halftime, the Meitei side had built a 3-0 lead. Haibung regrouped during the break and scored two goals soon after the match resumed. Midway through the second half, a tackle triggered protests and brief shoves before Assam Rifles personnel intervened. The commentator's reminder - ""khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein"" - returned. The game concluded 5-2 in favour of New Keithelmanbi. There were five yellow cards in the match.When the final whistle blew, players formed a line and shook hands without hesitation. The exchange was brief and routine. ""We just played,"" one said afterwards.Security personnel remained until the teams dispersed. The Meitei side returned toward the valley. Haibung FC boarded Assam Rifles buses and travelled across the buffer zone under armed escort - to villages where night patrols would resume.","Assam Rifles' Foothills Football Tournament held at New Keithelmanbi Garrison. 13 teams - eight Naga, three Meitei and two Kuki - from nearby villages gathered. Kuki teams crossed the buffer zone for the first time since May 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128362505,imgsize-146780,width-400,resizemode-4/128362505.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ahead of next week’s AI Impact Summit, Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion with commitments of around $90 billion already received.“We are working on all five layers of the AI stack. Conventionally, our strength has been providing IT services. Now, we have to convert this into providing AI-based services. The IT industry too has worked in recent years on this changing business model. It has invested in creating new tools and reskilling their workforce, so they can provide AI services,” Vaishnaw said, while addressing the ET NOW Global Business Summit.He added that after the UK, South Korea and France, India is set to host the biggest AI Impact summit next week, with more than 20 Heads of State and govts attending the event.“At the summit, we will be launching our bouquet of sovereign models. On so many parameters, the models are better than Open AI, Gemini Pro and Deep Seek, giving us confidence that India can develop models on very frugal resources,” said the minister, who is also in charge of railways and information and broadcasting ministries.Highlighting the development in the third layer of AI stack, Vaishnaw stressed that progress in semiconductor development — the “chip layer” — had been significant, with startups and research teams developing cutting-edge solutions that are expected to bear fruit in the coming years.Vaishnaw also noted electronic goods will be among the top two exported goods soon.“One of the key things Europeans wanted from India was electronic goods in the FTA. They wanted electronic items of all kinds for their industry and consumers, because we are a trusted country. India will become a trusted partner in the semiconductor and electronics value chain,” Vaishnaw said.The minister said AI is set to outpace all previous industrial revolutions and technological shifts, necessitating the need for industry and society to remain prepared for this swift transformation, as India’s coordinated push across talent, models, chips and applications will help position the country at the forefront of the global AI revolution.Sharing the progress on the first bullet train project , Vaishnaw said that the first section between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will open in 2027. He also said that the proposed Bengaluru–Chennai corridor could reduce travel time to just 73 minutes, thus bringing the two cities much closer and boosting economic activity.“Our engineers have really lived up to the challenge. Our industry too has gone through that learning curve and is practically self-sufficient in the entire high speed train technology. That is why Prime Minister Modi has announced seven new bullet train corridors, which will connect large parts of the country and transform the entire transportation industry. We are also going to standardise the entire system so that anyone in the world can come and participate. We will have a large role for the industry as well,” he added.On wider railway reforms, Vaishnaw said the ministry is working on “52 reforms in 52 weeks” in 2026, with two new reforms slated to be announced on the same day. Seven reforms have already been implemented and the rest are in progress.“These changes aim to improve overall travel experience, especially for daily passengers belonging to the low- and middle-income families. They remain our most important customers in the railways. We have been able to reduce accidents by about 90%. We want to further reduce it,” he said.","Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion.

JAMMU: J&K Police and BSF troopers seized on Saturday over 6kg of heroin, worth Rs 40 crore and suspected to have been dropped by a Pakistani drone, near the international border in Jammu’s RS Pura.“Following information about a drone dropping material from across the border, a joint operation by troopers of 165th battalion of BSF and J&K Police was launched. During the search, the drug consignment was recovered from Nai Basti Karotana village in Baspur area of RS Pura,” an official said.The contraband was wrapped in yellow polythene packets, the official said, adding local cops received information about the suspected drone movement late Friday night.Security sources described the seizure as a “big achievement” on the anti-drug trafficking front. It came a day after cops in Kathua, around 85km away, arrested two people for allegedly smuggling heroin dropped from Pakistani drones in border areas.“Further investigation is underway to trace the exact source and destination of the contraband. The police are thoroughly examining both backward and forward linkages in the case,” the official in RS Pura said.In Kathua, the two men held on Friday were identified as Danish Dogra, a local, and Jatin of Pathankot in neighbouring Punjab. They are accused of smuggling 150gm heroin and being in touch with a Pakistan-based peddler through VoIP calls.On Dec 23 last year, Kathua police had arrested four people, including a drug peddler associated with a Pakistan-based drone-dropped narcotics module. Seizures from them included Rs 5 lakh in cash and over 400gm of heroin allegedly dropped by a drone in the border village of Chhan Tanda in Hiranagar area.","J&K Police and BSF troopers seize over 6kg of heroin, worth Rs 40 crore.

NEW DELHI: A bomb threat was reported on an IndiGo flight operating from Dibrugarh to Kolkata on Saturday evening after a suspicious message was found inside the aircraft.The threat, reportedly written with lipstick inside the aircraft’s toilet, was discovered onboard IndiGo flight 6E6894 (Airbus A-320) bound for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.The aircraft landed safely at 7:37 pm and authorities immediately moved it to the isolation bay in accordance with established security protocols. All passengers were safely deboarded, Kolkata airport officials confirmed.This comes hours after a similar bomb scare was reported on an IndiGo flight scheduled to operate from Kolkata to Shillong earlier in the day.According to the airline, a security threat was noticed onboard flight 6E 7304 during boarding at Kolkata airport on February 14.Crew members found a piece of paper inside the aircraft’s toilet compartment stating that there was a bomb onboard.

94.5% kids survive after cancer treatment: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/94-5-kids-survive-after-cancer-treatment-study/articleshow/128361861.cms,"NEW DELHI: For thousands of families across India, the words ""cancer-free"" mark relief and new beginnings. But what happens after treatment ends has, until now, remained largely undocumented in the country.On the eve of International Childhood Cancer Day, researchers released findings from India's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme, tracking more than 5,400 children who completed treatment across 20 centres, including in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.Launched in 2016 by Indian Paediatric Haematology Oncology Group, the Indian Childhood Cancer Survivorship study is published in 'The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia'. Lead author Dr Rachna Seth, chief of the oncology division in the department of paediatrics at AIIMS, New Delhi, said the idea was conceptualised in 2014 and became operational by 2016. The analysis includes data from 2016 to 2024.""For years, the focus was only on acute care - that children should survive,"" she said. ""But now we know many do survive, and they have decades of life ahead of them. What matters next is how they live after treatment.""The early findings are encouraging. The five-year overall survival rate stands at 94.5%, while event-free survival is at 89.9%. Two years after treatment, the survival rate rises to 98.2%. As of Dec 2024, follow-up data was available for 5,140 children, with 92% alive and in remission.Leukaemia accounted for 41% of cases, making it the most common diagnosis in the cohort. Hodgkin lymphoma, bone tumours and retinoblastoma were also among the leading cancers treated. Nearly all children received chemotherapy, about one in four underwent radiotherapy, nearly one-third required surgery and more than half needed blood transfusions.Seth said survivors may face long-term medical and psychosocial challenges, including fertility concerns, cardiac dysfunction, cognitive issues, relapse and second cancers. ""These late effects need to be systematically captured. Until now, we were largely extrapolating from Western data. India had none,"" she said.While the published analysis covers 20 centres, nearly 35 to 36 centres are now contributing data. ""This gives us our own baseline,"" Seth said.The median follow-up period so far is 3.9 years from diagnosis. About 5.7% experienced relapse and 4.9% died during follow-up.","Researchers release findings from India's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme.

EC had last written to Bengal govt on Feb 4, seeking a compliance report by 3 pm on Feb 9, 2026.Among the key issues flagged by EC is the failure of state govt to pay full honorarium to BLOs. As of now, Bengal govt has paid Rs 7,000 as honorarium to BLOs, as against Rs 13,000 payable as per EC’s guidelines. BLO supervisors, for whom EC has fixed an honorarium of Rs 20,000, have not been paid at all.

The legitimacy people have given to the Assembly demands that it works in that spirit,” Muntazir told the TOI outside the Assembly on Friday.“We should not say the J&K Assembly is disempowered. No party or legislator should say this. We should not use discouraging words or claim that nothing can be done through this Assembly. Even in the present setup, the Assembly is a powerful institution,” he said.“After Aug 5, 2019, people gave legitimacy to this Assembly by participating in the polls in large, unprecedented numbers not seen in the past 36 years. Now you cannot tell the same people that it is a disempowered Assembly. We must strive for political rights of J&K, but at the same time the legitimacy of this Assembly shouldn’t be negated,” he added.Muntazir, 38, entered the Assembly for the first time after winning the Budgam seat, defeating National Conference candidate Aga Syed Mahmood by 4,478 votes.The bypoll defeat was a major setback for the CM who had vacated the Budgam seat in 2024 after winning from it.Muntazir is the son of Aga Syed Hasan, a senior Shia cleric and former leader of separatist conglomerate All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Muntazir earlier worked as a grassroots activist before entering electoral politics.Muntazir, who holds an LLM degree, said Budgam has suffered nearly two decades of neglect despite its proximity to Srinagar. Since joining the Assembly, he regularly raises concerns about roads, education, drinking water and healthcare in his constituency, where literacy levels remain low. “In the past 20 years, the same party (NC) represented Budgam. People were given only rhetoric, but political rhetoric has a shelf life,” he said. “The people voted for change because their dignity and basic needs were ignored for a long time.”He said the CM had earlier assured the establishment of a National Law University in Budgam and the promise was made in the House. “It must be honoured.

He said he still held copyright over the composition by his father and his uncle.The plaintiff had said credit should be given to the Dagar Brothers when the ‘Veera Raja Veera’ version was played across all modes and mediums, including digital, internet, OTT platforms, satellite, cable television, etc.Delhi HC’s Justice Pratibha Singh had asked the existing credit line ‘Composition based on a Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad’ be replaced with ‘Composition based on Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar, Late Ustad Zahiruddin Dagar’.The four defendants, including Rahman, were asked to deposit Rs 2 crore each, subject to outcome of the suit. A division bench of the HC had set aside the interim directions — change of credit and Rs 2 crore deposit — saying Dagar had failed to establish prima facie proof of authorship or originality of ‘Shiva Stuti’.An SC bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told Rahman’s counsel, A M Singhvi, that the plaintiff has made out a case with regard to the originality of the composition but the issue of authorship would be examined.Both the CJI and Justice Bagchi were unequivocal about the immense contributions made by Dagar Bandhu to Indian classical music and said, “Without their and other exponents’ contributions, do you think modern singers would have survived?” SC told Singhvi “instead of going into legal niceties, you could give some respect to them.

CDS General Anil Chauhan Links History With Border Disputes With China, Recalls Nehru Knew About It

NEW DELHI: Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Saturday took a swipe at neighbouring Pakistan while referring to Operation Sindoor , saying “victory is not declared by mere rhetoric.” He made the remarks while reflecting on India’s defence preparedness and stressing the need to strengthen national security systems. He also said that a sense of victory cannot be built on “dysfunctional air defence systems.”Speaking at the opening session of the ‘JAI Se Vijay’ seminar in Pune, Gen Chauhan referred to India’s success in Operation Sindoor and emphasised that “actual vijay lies in demonstrated evidence.” He said India must carry out a “sober assessment” of its defence systems to prepare for present and future challenges.Without directly naming Pakistan, the CDS highlighted the damage it suffered during India’s counterterror operation in May, launched after Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025.“With respect to the defence forces, victory is not declared by mere rhetoric. As some entities in our neighbourhood have done so, but demonstrated through evidence, like what we showcased during Operation Sindoor. A sense of victory cannot be built on demolished terror infrastructure, damaged runways, crippled airfields, and dysfunctional air defence systems. Such kinds of victories or slogans do not endure.Actual Vijay lies in demonstrated evidence rather than verifiable outcomes...,” the CDS said.Highlighting future risks, General Chauhan said India’s defence posture over the next decade must be based on a realistic evaluation of emerging threats.“Why this is important is because currently, India's defence posture for the next decade is required to be shaped by a sober assessment of what lies ahead, what kind of challenges lie ahead. And I believe it's increasingly becoming very competitive, confrontational, combative, fragile, and technologically very disruptive,” he added.He also said that in today’s changing global environment, countries can no longer assume permanent friendships or rivalries, and India must be ready to act independently if needed.“Assumptions about permanent friends or adversaries are increasingly becoming unreliable. In today's world, it is difficult to define who your friends are, who your allies are, who your enemies are and who your adversaries are. India must therefore be prepared mentally, structurally and materially to act independently when required,” he said.The CDS said partnerships remain important but cannot replace India’s own capabilities or freedom to make independent decisions. He stressed the need to strengthen domestic defence capacity to ensure strategic autonomy.Explaining the theme ‘JAI Se Vijay,’ Gen Chauhan said that in modern warfare, victory cannot be based on rhetoric or symbolic claims but must rest on “demonstrated evidence and verifiable outcomes.” He warned that damaging infrastructure or airfields alone does not guarantee lasting victory.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s idea of JAI -- which stands for Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation -- Gen Chauhan said it reflects freedom from foreign dependence and outdated thinking. “It is not just victory over an adversary, but equally victory over inertia, prejudices, and institutional comfort,” he said.",Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan took a swipe at neighbouring Pakistan. He made the remarks while reflecting on India’s defence preparedness. He also said that a sense of victory cannot be built on “dysfunctional air defence systems”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128349111,imgsize-530541,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

India aims to reset AI debate with 1st Global South summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aims-to-reset-ai-debate-with-1st-global-south-summit/articleshow/128368389.cms,"'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Nvidia CEO unable to attend AI Summit



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ,who was to be one of the biggest attractions at the India AI Impact Summit starting on Monday, will not be able to travel to India for the event. The company issued astatement Saturday, ascribing it to “unforeseen circumstances”. Huang was expected to play a prominent role at the summit — set to be inaugurated by PM Modi.



Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $4.4 trillion, thanks to its processors that have become indispensable to the training of AI models. Persons familiar with the development told TOI that Huang is under the weather. Nvidia said a senior delegation led by executive vice-president Jay Puri will attend the event to “celebrate India’s exceptional AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners building country’s AI infrastructure.” TNN





New Delhi : Unthinkable just a few years ago, when artificial intelligence was a shiny experiment — impressive demos, niche tools, and a buzzword that rarely touched daily life — today it sits at the heart of how jobs are created, services delivered, science conducted and societies governed. As the world grapples with both its promise and its risks, India is stepping into a new role, as not just a user of AI but also as a global agenda-setter, becoming the the first developing country and the first nation from the Global South to convene a global AI summit.Speaking exclusively to TOI , Abhishek Singh, CEO of India AI Mission and AI Impact Summit, believes that this is India’s attempt to pull the global AI debate away from elite labs and corporate boardrooms and anchor it in people, inclusion and real-world outcomes.“This is the first summit of its kind and scale being hosted in the Global South,” said Singh, adding, “AI today is largely controlled by a few countries and a few companies. India wants to bring the perspective of the Global South and ensure that AI is more inclusive and democratised.”India’s case for hosting the summit, Singh said, rests on experience rather than theory. Over the past decade, platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker and telemedicine have shown how digital systems can operate at population scale, delivering services to hundreds of millions.“India has shown its ability to adopt technology for public services,” said Singh, “We want to showcase India’s strength in building AI applications at population scale and also be the voice of the Global South.”The summit comes at a time when govts worldwide are struggling to balance rapid AI innovation with growing concerns over deepfakes, misinformation, bias and misuse. While there is broad agreement that AI should drive economic growth and social good, Singh said translating principles into practice remains uneven.“Every country agrees on two things: AI must be used for larger social good; and harm from AI must be restricted,” he said. “But countries are at very different levels of technological development. That is where regulatory capacity and shared frameworks become important.” India’s approach, he explained, is based on what it calls a ‘techno-legal framework,’ combining legal safeguards with technological tools. Legal provisions require harmful content to be taken down within defined timelines and mandate labelling of AI-generated content, especially where it poses risks to individuals, public order or national security. Alongside this, India is developing tools to detect deepfakes, mitigate bias and create ethical AI certification systems.A major focus of the summit is human capital. As automation reshapes work and threatens traditional livelihoods, the summit aims to push global cooperation on reskilling and workforce transitions, particularly for developing economies facing resource constraints.“AI should not grow only in tech hubs,” Singh said. “We are setting up data labs across the country, centres of excellence in states and smaller cities, and running large-scale skilling and training programmes so that AI reaches tier-2 and tier-3 cities.” Inclusion is another central theme, with India highlighting the role of Indian-language and voicebased AI systems in expanding access. Platforms built on natural language processing and generative AI allow people to access services in their own languages, especially those uncomfortable with English.The summit’s agenda also spans AI-enabled scientific research in healthcare, agriculture and climate, while pushing for openness, reproducibility and shared standards.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be able to travel to India for the event.

Jaishankar on Russia ties: Firmly wedded to strategic autonomy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-on-russia-ties-firmly-wedded-to-strategic-autonomy/articleshow/128368198.cms,"'Gave Fundamental Confidence': Jaishankar Cites Nuclear Tests, Stresses Strategic Autonomy

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said India remains firmly committed to strategic autonomy, even as the global energy markets evolve and partnerships shift. He was responding to a question at the Munich Security Conference whether a recent trade agreement with the US would affect New Delhi’s energy ties with Russia and if India was finding it difficult to exercise its strategic autonomy in the current circumstances.India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests and the actual crude sourcing is done by oil companies taking into account pricing, reliability and other market conditions.“We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy because it’s a part of our history and our evolution. It’s something which is very deep, and something which cuts across the political spectrum as well,” he said.Addressing concerns over energy sourcing, the EAM described the global oil market as complex and dynamic, stressing that commercial considerations guide procurement decisions.“As for energy issues, this is a complex market today. Oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks and take the decisions that they feel are in their best interest,” he noted.Jaishankar said that in a rapidly changing global environment, countries continuously reassess their calculations and partnerships.“So many things are changing, and so many of us are doing our calculations and recalculations,” he said, adding while India may not agree with all partners on every issue, dialogue and a willingness to find common ground remain important.“We would not necessarily agree on everything but I do believe that by doing that, and if there is an inclination to find common ground and overlaps, that would happen,” he said.Noting India’s independent decision-making, he said, “If the bottom line of your question is would I remain independent-minded and make my decisions? And would I make choices which sometimes may not agree with your thinking or somebody else’s thinking, yes, it can happen.”He met with G7 foreign ministers and their global counterparts at the Munich Security Conference 2026, reiterating India’s support for the UN80 agenda and underscoring New Delhi’s role in safeguarding global security.Jaishankar also stressed on India’s role in safeguarding sea lines of communication, acting as a first responder in crises, strengthening port security and contributing to resilient submarine cable infrastructure.","India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests and the actual crude sourcing is done by oil companies. “We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy because it’s a part of our history and our evolution,” Jaishankar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128368306,imgsize-64712,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar.jpg"

It released status report of 21 Reras as of Feb 13.The availability of updated annual reports is crucial as these contain details of data on performance of Reras, including project completion status categorised by timely completion, completion with extensions, and incomplete projects. The ministry's format for publishing these reports also specifies providing details such as actual execution status of refund, possession and compensation orders as well as recovery warrant execution details with values and list of defaulting builders.FPCE said annual report data is not only vital for homebuyers to assess system credibility, but is equally necessary for both state and central govts to frame effective policies, design incentivisation schemes, and develop tax policy frameworks.""Unless we have credible data proving that after Rera the real estate sector has improved in terms of delivery, fairness, and keeping its promises, we are merely firing in the air,"" said FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who is also a member of the govt's Central Advisory Council on Rera.As per details shared by the entity, seven states - Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Goa - have never published a single annual report since Rera's implementation, and nine states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, which initially published reports, have discontinued the practice.Upadhyay said when regulators themselves don't follow the law, they lose the legal right to demand compliance from other stakeholders.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused Congress leader V Narayanasamy of turning Puducherry into an “ATM for the Gandhi family” during his tenure as chief minister of the poll-bound Union territory.The senior BJP leader also alleged that the Narayanasamy administration “sold” PG and diploma seats, including those for reserved category candidates, to “wealthy individuals.”Narayanasamy served as chief minister from June 2016 to February 2021.“Narayanasamy’s government had turned Puducherry into an ATM for the Gandhi family. They openly auctioned PG and diploma seats and even sold the reserved seats for SC and ST to wealthy individuals for the sake of money. Transport mafias were given free rein to trouble the public,” Shah said at a public meeting in Puducherry’s Karaikal.The former BJP president added that Congress leader’s tenure as chief minister was marked by “corruption and chaos,” which the BJP — part of the All India NR Congress-led incumbent government — has worked to eliminate.He further asserted that the saffron party’s focus is now on transforming Puducherry into a developed Union territory over the next five years.“For five years, the Congress government created an environment of corruption and chaos here. In five years, we eliminated corruption and transformed chaos into order, and now it is time to transform Puducherry into a developed Puducherry in the next five years. Earlier, the decisions regarding Puducherry were taken by the Gandhi family in Delhi; now the decisions regarding Puducherry are being taken by Puducherry itself,” Shah told the gathering.Noting that the BJP-All India NR Congress alliance secured 44% of the vote in the 2021 Puducherry assembly elections, he set a target of 60% for the upcoming polls, expected in April.“PM Narendra Modi has worked to make India prosperous as well as secure. The people of Puducherry have expressed their trust in the NDA, BJP, and our leader N Rangaswamy and PM Modi. In the 2021 assembly elections, the people of Puducherry gave us 44% of the votes. This time, the alliance of BJP, AINRC and AIADMK is aiming to secure 60% of the votes,” he added.","The senior BJP leader also alleged that the Narayanasamy administration “sold” PG and diploma seats, including those for reserved category candidates, to “wealthy individuals” Shah added that Congress leader’s tenure as chief minister was marked by “corruption and chaos,” which the BJP has worked to eliminate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128351202,imgsize-98046,width-400,resizemode-4/amit-shah-addressing-a-public-meeting-in-puducherry39s-karaikal.jpg"

After Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra Faces Power Vacuum As NCP And Alliances Enter Uncharted Territory

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Sharad Pawar-led faction of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday dismissed what it termed a “perception” that it had been aggressively pursuing a merger with the rival NCP group headed by Ajit Pawar , who died in a plane crash last month.The final decision on a merger was to take place after the recent local body polls and its framework was to be decided through discussions, according to NCP (SP) Maharashtra unit chief Shashikant Shinde.""A perception is being created that we were pushing aggressively for a merger. This is not correct. We have now decided to rebuild our party. The issue (of merger) has been closed by the NCP (SP),"" Shinde told reporters in Mumbai.“There is no point in discussing a possible merger as there is no leader left to hold talks with,” he added, referring to Ajit Pawar, who had split the undivided NCP in July 2023 and aligned with the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena faction.The Election Commission recognises the Ajit Pawar faction as the “real” NCP.Shinde also referred to his article on the late Maharashtra deputy chief minister, who was serving his sixth term in the post at the time of his death and was the state’s longest-serving deputy chief minister.The NCP criticised the piece — published in the February 2026 edition of the NCP (SP) mouthpiece ""Rashtravadi"" — alleging that it contained “false and misleading” claims about the circumstances under which the Maratha leader exited the undivided party.In the article, Shinde wrote that “manoeuvres by invisible forces, threats, and a web of false allegations” had created a situation that compelled Ajit Pawar to leave the parent organisation, resulting in the split in the party founded by his uncle Sharad Pawar Clarifying his remarks, the NCP (SP) MLC said he had not suggested that Ajit Pawar had made a mistake. “I only said he wanted to rectify the division of the party,” he stated.Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal questioned the need for ""daily discussions"" on a potential merger.“Sunetra Pawar (Ajit Pawar’s wife) is now the deputy CM and will soon be the NCP national president. She will discuss the matter and take a call,” Bhujbal said.“When Sunetra Pawar was sworn in as deputy CM, there was criticism about the haste. Why is there similar haste in talking about a merger?” he asked.","The Election Commission recognises the Ajit Pawar faction as the “real’ NCP.

Why Traditional Marriages Are Being Replaced By New Love Models

The many faces of gamophobia

Fear of dependency or vulnerability

Fear of repeating past relational trauma

Fear of losing one’s identity

Fear of failure in love

Fear of societal expectations tied to marriage

When love is easy, but forever is not

Not equal to inability to love

Why fear of commitment might be growing

A culture of choice and comparison

Individual identity over collectivism

Witnessing relationship breakdowns

Trauma and attachment styles

Changing gender roles and expectations

Gamophobia in India: Between tradition and modernity

Marriage as familial responsibility

Pressure to settle down early

Fear of “what will people say”

Arranged marriage traditions

Gendered expectations around roles

Not all fear is pathology

In a world where relationships have become both more visible and more complex, a curious psychological phenomenon has been quietly gaining attention — gamophobia, the fear of commitment or marriage.It is more than just the occasional cold feet, jitters before a proposal or hesitation about settling down. Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. Increasingly, mental health professionals, writers and even everyday couples are referring to this concept not just as a quirky term, but as a genuine emotional resistance.Ankur Halder, 27-year-old IT professional, put it perfectly-The word “gamophobia” itself comes from the Greek gamos (marriage) and phobia (fear). At its core, it speaks about the fear of marrying or entering into long-term intimate commitment. Yet, in practice, it is far more nuanced. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship. Instead, they fear the permanence, vulnerability, expectations, and potential loss of autonomy that life-long attachment can entail.But why is this fear becoming more visible now? Why are more people open to calling themselves “afraid of commitment”? Is this simply a symptom of a generation spoiled for choice, or is it rooted in deeper psychological and social shifts? And importantly — what does this look like in a place like India, where marriage still carries cultural gravity unlike many parts of the world?To explore these questions, we must go beyond the label and into the lived realities that make gamophobia resonate in the twenty-first century.Gamophobia is not a clinical diagnosis in major psychiatric manuals like the DSM-V; it is a loosely defined term used in psychological, cultural and pop-psychology circles. Yet, its emergence reflects real emotional and relational patterns that therapists see every day.For some, it manifests as anxiety or panic when conversations about the future get serious. For others, it shows up as chronic relationship sabotage — starting strong, pulling away, or falling into self-fulfilling breakups before things get too real. Some experience sleeplessness, avoidance, or physical symptoms at the thought of tying their life to another.Importantly, gamophobia is not just about fear of marriage. It can express as:For a growing number of young Indians, this fear is not abstract. It surfaces at a very specific moment — when romance begins to gather weight.In this country, relationships rarely remain suspended in emotional possibility. They are expected to culminate. They must formalise. They must move toward marriage.And it is often at this threshold that something shifts.Aarav, 32, who works at an MNC in Mumbai said over the past decade, he has been in three serious relationships. Each followed a similar rhythm: an intense beginning, emotional intimacy, shared vacations. For months, sometimes years, everything felt certain.Then came the conversations about meeting parents. About timelines. About “where this is heading,"" and began to withdraw.“I don’t know what happens,” he says. “It’s like something switches off. I start imagining all the ways it could go wrong. What if I lose my freedom? What if I’m not ready? What if I choose wrong and can’t undo it?”Gamophobia often unfolds in exactly this way. Individuals form romantic bonds with ease. They are affectionate, attentive, emotionally engaged. But when a relationship approaches formal commitment — engagement, marriage, shared finances — anxiety spikes. The future stops feeling romantic and starts feeling irreversible.One of the most persistent myths about gamophobia is that it signals emotional immaturity or incapacity for deep feeling. This assumption could not be further from the truth.People who struggle with commitment anxiety often love intensely. They may be attentive partners, emotionally available in the present, and genuinely invested in their relationships. The difficulty does not lie in affection. It lies in anticipation.For some, the fear is rooted in childhood experiences. For others, it stems from witnessing marital dissatisfaction. And for many in contemporary India, it arises from the weight of making the “right” decision in a world that offers both endless choice and irreversible consequences.In that sense, gamophobia is less about rejecting love and more about fearing a mistake that cannot be undone.A 29-year-old woman (choosing to stay anonymous) grew up watching her parents argue behind closed doors while maintaining a composed public image. Divorce was never discussed. Silence was easier than separation.“When people talk about marriage,” she says, “I don’t picture romance. I picture staying even when you’re unhappy.”Children absorb more than they realise. When marriage is modeled as endurance rather than companionship, commitment can subconsciously begin to resemble confinement.We live in an age where options, especially romantic ones, feel infinite. Dating apps, social media, global mobility, and curated images of “the perfect relationship” create an illusion of endless possibility. When one believes that the next swipe might be better, committing to one person can paradoxically feel limiting rather than reassuring.This reflects deeper cognitive patterns of comparison, fear of missing out, and choice overload. Instead of narrowing options feeling comforting, it can trigger anxiety about losing potential alternatives forever.In recent decades, individualism has become central to people’s sense of self. Career goals, personal growth, and self-discovery are prioritized more than ever. While this is empowering, it also changes how relationships are viewed. Commitment starts to feel like a trade-off — balancing autonomy with attachment.Ankur Halder said, ""I believe a healthy relationship should consist of two independent individuals choosing to be together. Relationships today have evolved, unlike older generations like say my grandparents, where partners were often overly dependent on each other. I appreciate that relationships now allow more individuality.""We grow up surrounded by stories of failed marriages, divorces, and high-profile celebrity breakups. Seeing relationships fall apart shapes our ideas about commitment — making it feel risky rather than romantic.How we bond emotionally is influenced by early life experiences. People with avoidant attachment often fear losing independence in close relationships. Those with anxious attachment may fear being abandoned, even in healthy partnerships.Someone whose early friendships ended abruptly may struggle to fully commit to a partner, worrying that closeness will lead to inevitable loss.Traditional roles, like men as sole breadwinners and women as primary caregivers, have changed, but old expectations don’t disappear overnight. Women don’t want to be bound by household duties, and years of social conditioning have made many feel that, at some point, they’ll have to sacrifice their dreams to fulfill the expectations of a relationship.People everywhere often find themselves balancing new possibilities with inherited norms, creating tension in romantic relationships as they navigate who does what, how decisions are made, and what each partner “should” contribute.In India, marriage has long been treated as a central life milestone- expected, celebrated, and often orchestrated by family.Urbanisation, increased female workforce participation, and exposure to global culture have changed how young Indians think about partnership. Emotional compatibility and personal growth matter more than ever before.At the same time, entrenched expectations persist:In this environment, gamophobia can take on unique contours. For some, it becomes resistance against pressure, a boundary against societal coercion. For others, it reflects genuine uncertainty about whether traditional marital structures align with their evolving identities.Adding another layer of complexity, leaving a partner in India is often socially difficult. Relationships are not just between two individuals — they are entwined with family expectations, social judgment, and, in many cases, children.In India, many hesitate to end relationships even when they feel unfulfilled, fearing the stigma of separation or the impact on their children. This has created a common misconception: staying despite unhappiness is often interpreted as commitment or proof of love, when it may instead reflect social pressure and obligations.Intergenerational values also play a role. Many Indian families prize endurance and sacrifice in relationships. While admirable, these ideals can unintentionally silence emotional needs. Young adults may find themselves torn between honoring tradition and honoring their own readiness.Mental health awareness in India is still developing. Anxiety around commitment may be dismissed as stubbornness or irresponsibility rather than understood as emotional complexity. Without language for their fears, many individuals internalise guilt instead of seeking support.It is crucial to recognise that gamophobia is not always dysfunction. Fear can be protective, especially after painful or unstable relationships. It may signal the need for clarity, healing, or stronger identity formation.In a society that often equates marriage with success, choosing to pause or question is not necessarily avoidance. It may be discernment.Challenging conventional marriage norms, Ankur said, “I have a somewhat sceptical view of marriage. While I understand that it works well for many people, most marriages I’ve observed seem complicated and full of ongoing issues. That has made me question whether the institution itself is necessary, or whether commitment can exist in other forms.”Gamophobia is a mirror. It reflects personal insecurities and broader cultural change. It reminds us that commitment is not merely a social contract, but an emotional decision shaped by history, identity, and context.In India and beyond, the increasing visibility of commitment anxiety does not mean a generation is incapable of love. It suggests that people are thinking more deeply about what love demands.And perhaps, in asking those difficult questions, we are not drifting away from commitment but are learning to approach it with greater awareness.Love, after all, is not weakened by reflection.It is strengthened by choice.","Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship. Instead, they fear the permanence, vulnerability, expectations, and potential loss of autonomy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128343268,imgsize-1504417,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-6.jpg"

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Saturday responded sharply to alleged objectionable comments made by state BJP president Nainar Nagendran about actor-politician Vijay and actor Trisha.DMK MP Kanimozhi NVN Somu condemned the remarks, calling it “uncivilised” to target the personal lives of those engaged in active politics. She also criticised women leaders in the Tamil Nadu BJP for not speaking out against Nagendran.“Criticising the personal life of someone involved in politics in the public sphere is uncivilised. Moreover, speaking in a way that degrades the dignity and honour of a woman who has no connection to politics is an act that tarnishes womanhood. For Mr Nainar Nagendran, the female leaders in the BJP remaining silent without condemning this is an injustice,” Kanimozhi posted on X.Another DMK MP, Tamizhachi Thangapandian, also criticised Nagendran, saying it was “unbecoming” of the Tamil Nadu unit president of a party that leads the Union government to make disparaging remarks about a woman expressing political views while travelling in public. She added that civilised politics requires treating women with ""dignity and respect.""“It is not seemly for the Tamil Nadu state president of the party ruling India to speak disparagingly about a woman travelling in public while expressing political opinions. Speaking of and treating women with dignity is what constitutes civilised politics,” Thangapandian wrote on X.The controversy erupted after Nagendran commented on Vijay’s recent rally in Salem. Referring to the actor’s lack of political experience, he suggested that Vijay should focus on his family and “come out of actor Trisha.""Vijay, who founded and heads the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), earlier addressed supporters in Salem ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections. He said that while his party may lack political experience, it does not have ""experience in corruption.""“Other than scamming experience, what are the other qualities do the people who question my experience have? We don’t have experience, yes. We don’t have experience in looting,” he said, in an attack on the DMK.His remarks followed Tamil Nadu and DMK supremo chief minister MK Stalin announcing that Rs 5,000 had been credited to women beneficiaries under the Kalaignar Women’s Rights Scheme.

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Saturday pushed his party’s demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , led by chief minister MK Stalin , ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections. He said the Congress was seeking constituencies that the DMK had lost in the 2021 polls and emphasised that ""power-sharing was essential"" in state's governance. However, days earlier, Stalin ruled out the possibility of sharing power with allies.Tagore’s remarks came in response to comments made by DMK leader and state minister RS Raja Kannappan in Madurai on February 13, where he asserted that the DMK would contest 170 constituencies and win 160 seats in the upcoming election.Reacting to the statement, Tagore, the MP from Virudhunagar, said in a post on X: “In 2021, you contested in 173 seats and secured 133. What we are asking (now) are the seats which you failed to win.”He further underlined the Congress’s position on governance, saying, “Power sharing is necessary. The share in power is our right. The people will decide,” while sharing a video clip of Raja Kannappan’s speech.In the video, Raja Kannappan ruled out the possibility of a coalition government, expressing confidence that the DMK would independently secure 160 seats.The Tamil Nadu Assembly has 234 seats, and the DMK-Congress alliance had won 151 seats in the 2021 elections.Days earlier, CM Stalin strongly ruled out sharing power with allies, while maintaining that the alliance with the Congress remained “intact” and free of confusion. “We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,” Stalin said.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K Selvaperunthagai announced in Chennai that formal alliance talks between the Congress and the DMK would begin on February 22. He asserted that the INDIA bloc remained united despite attempts by the Bharatiya Janata Party to weaken the alliance.“The election process is going very, very smoothly. Negotiations are ongoing, and we are going to start on February 22. Nothing the BJP is thinking will happen. The BJP wants to pull someone out of the INDIA alliance to split the vote bank, but it will not happen. We are intact with the alliance,” Selvaperunthagai told reporters.Responding to remarks by actor-politician Vijay, who recently said “SOP” in Tamil Nadu stood for “Stalin Operating Procedure,” Selvaperunthagai said such procedures were common across all political parties.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore pushed his party’s demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

"Bihar assembly polls: INDIA bloc alleges more than 5,000 UP residents added to electoral rolls; EC calls claim 'imaginary'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-india-bloc-alleges-more-than-5000-up-residents-added-to-electoral-rolls-ec-calls-claim-imaginary/articleshow/123537577.cms,"Congress national general secretary Randeep Surjewala (Image credits: PTI)

NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Tuesday accused the Election Commission of adding “more than 5,000” voters from Uttar Pradesh to electoral rolls in an adjoining Bihar district to give an advantage to the ruling NDA in the upcoming assembly polls.At a press conference in Phulparas, Madhubani district, Congress national general secretary Randeep Surjewala and RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha alleged that the “doubtful” voters were mostly registered in the Valmiki Nagar assembly segment of West Champaran district, reported PTI.They cited the case of a 45-year-old man who appeared in Bihar’s rolls despite being an elector of the Khadda constituency in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.The Election Commission rejected the charge, describing the figure as “imaginary” and without evidence.In a statement issued by the West Champaran district administration and shared by the office of the chief electoral officer, officials clarified that “it is a draft electoral roll that has been published by the EC on August 1 and not the final voters' list. The very purpose of draft rolls is to invite claims and objections with regard to duplications or any other discrepancies.”The administration further said, “Moreover, in the press conference, the figure of more than 5,000 doubtful voters has been bandied about without any further details or evidence. It seems to be an imaginary figure which does not lend itself to verification.”It explained that in Valmiki Nagar, changes in the course of rivers often force residents to shift their addresses, which sometimes leads to multiple registrations. “The special intensive revision is aimed at removing such discrepancies,” the statement noted.On the case of Chhedi Ram, the Khadda voter named by Surjewala and Jha, the administration clarified that his name was included in the draft rolls but “he has already moved an application for deletion of his name” from the UP constituency.","The Election Commission rejected the charge, describing the figure as “imaginary” and without evidence.

Assault by bouncers? Actor-politician & TVK chief Vijay booked in manhandling case during rally in Perambalur; case registered under three sections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assault-by-bouncers-actor-politician-tvk-chief-vijay-booked-in-manhandling-case-during-rally-in-perambalur-case-registered-under-three-setions/articleshow/123537332.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police in Kunnam have registered a case against actor-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Thalapathy Vijay along with his bouncers following a complaint of alleged assault.According to officials, the case was filed based on a complaint submitted by Sarathkumar at the Perambalur District Superintendent of Police office. He alleged that he was manhandled by Vijay’s bouncers during an incident.Kunnam Police said a case has been registered against Vijay and his security staff under three sections of the Indian Penal Code.The development comes as Vijay, who founded TVK in 2024, seeks to position himself as a major challenger in Tamil Nadu politics. Earlier this month, the actor-politician declared that he would contest the 2026 assembly elections from Madurai East, making his most direct pitch yet to take on the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).At the party’s second state conference in Madurai, Vijay launched a fiery attack on the DMK, calling it his main political rival while identifying the Bharatiya Janata Party as TVK’s “only ideological enemy.”Drawing loud cheers from thousands of supporters, he declared, “TVK is not a political game; it is an ideology. This is not a speech for publicity. This is a warning to those who are in power. TVK is here to dominate. Crores of people are with us. The 2026 election is a fight between TVK and DMK.”Vijay has sought to frame TVK as a clean, uncompromising force. “TVK is not a party that makes underground deals, forges alliances, and cheats the people. We are not afraid of anyone. The people of Tamil Nadu, the women and the youth stand with us,” he said. At the rally, he also promised to “free Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka” and ensure the safety of Tamil Nadu fishermen, a long-standing political demand in the state.His recent political events have drawn massive crowds, underlining his appeal beyond the silver screen. The Madurai rally was billed as TVK’s biggest mobilisation yet, echoing historic elections of 1967 and 1977 when new parties under CN Annadurai and MG Ramachandran rose to power. Vijay, however, enters politics as a newcomer despite his two-decade-long popularity as a film icon.The actor-turned-politician has also been sharpening his criticism of chief minister MK Stalin’s DMK government. On social media, he condemned the arrest of protesting sanitation workers in Chennai as “fascist” and “inhumane.” He has repeatedly attacked both state and central governments on issues such as custodial deaths and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), demanding its abolition. “Revoke NEET! Can you do it, Narendra Modi avargal?” he asked, directly addressing the Prime Minister.Even as his rallies have showcased TVK’s growing strength, they have not been without setbacks. At the recent Madurai conference, a 33-year-old party worker from Chennai, Prabhakaran, collapsed and died on his way to the event, casting a shadow over the gathering.",Police in Kunnam have registered a case against actor-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Thalapathy Vijay.

SCO summit: PM Modi to be in China after 7 years; Xi Jinping to host over 20 world leaders including Vladimir Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-summit-pm-modi-to-be-in-china-after-7-years-xi-jinping-to-host-over-20-world-leaders-inculding-putin/articleshow/123537009.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping will host more than 20 world leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin next week, in what analysts describe as a show of Global South solidarity and diplomatic support for Russia.According to a Reuters report, the summit, scheduled for August 31 to September 1, will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.The gathering will mark PM Modi’s first visit to China in over seven years as both countries continue efforts to ease tensions following deadly border clashes in 2020. PM Modi last shared the stage with Xi and Putin during the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, even as Western leaders distanced themselves from the Russian president over the war in Ukraine.Russian officials in New Delhi said Moscow hopes trilateral talks involving India and China will take place soon.""Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,"" said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project.""Just look at how much Brics has rattled (US President) Donald Trump, which is precisely what these groups are designed to do. ""Chinese officials said this year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO’s founding in 2001, calling the bloc an ""important force in building a new type of international relations."" Initially set up by six Eurasian nations to focus on security, the SCO has since expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer states, extending its agenda to economic and military cooperation.Analysts note, however, that the bloc’s outcomes have often been limited. ""What is the precise vision that the SCO represents and its practical implementation are rather fuzzy. It is a platform that has increasing convening power, which helps in narrative projection,"" said Manoj Kewalramani of the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore. ""But the SCO's effectiveness in addressing substantial security issues remains very limited. ""Frictions persist among members, especially India and Pakistan. The June SCO defence ministers’ meeting failed to adopt a joint statement after India objected to the omission of a reference to the April 22 terror attack on Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir. New Delhi also refused to endorse the bloc’s condemnation of Israeli strikes on Iran earlier this year.Still, experts say geopolitical shifts are pushing India and China towards dialogue. The easing of border tensions and renewed tariff pressures on New Delhi from the Trump administration are fuelling expectations of a constructive meeting between Xi and PM Modi. ""It's likely (New Delhi) will swallow their pride and put this year's SCO problems behind them in a bid to maintain momentum in the détente with China, which is a key Modi priority right now,"" Olander added.Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said India’s priorities at the SCO include trade, connectivity, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Modi is expected to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines, with possible announcements on troop withdrawals, trade facilitation, visa easing, climate cooperation, and people-to-people engagement.While substantive policy breakthroughs are unlikely, analysts believe the optics of the summit will be crucial. ""This summit is about optics, really powerful optics,"" Olander said. PM Modi will leave China after the summit, while Putin is expected to stay for a World War Two military parade in Beijing, marking an unusually long foreign visit for the Russian leader.(With inputs from Reuters)","Chinese President Xi Jinping will host more than 20 world leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin next week. The summit will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123537494,imgsize-24274,width-400,resizemode-4/123537494.jpg"

India to begin testing new long-range interceptor missiles for defence shield next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-begin-testing-new-long-range-interceptor-missiles-for-defence-shield-next-year/articleshow/123536547.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha.

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: At 21% above normal, north India has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013, the year of the cataclysmic Kedarnath flash flood. Worryingly, in Aug, the region has experienced by far the highest number of 'extremely heavy' rain events since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began collating this data in 2021.Till Aug 25, north India had logged 21 extremely heavy rain events, a 50% rise over the previous highest of 14 recorded last year, even though that month had registered higher rainfall. The number of such events is likely to rise further by the end of the month, making this Aug's monsoon among the most destructive in the region in recent years.'Extremely heavy' is IMD's highest category of daily rainfall recorded at a weather station, defined as over 204.5mm in 24 hours.This monsoon, north India is the only one among India's four regions to register a rain surplus in all three months (June, July, Aug) of the season so far - another first for the North since 2013.""In the last two months, northwest India (IMD nomenclature for north India) has seen high rainfall activity mainly because of frequent interactions between western disturbances and monsoon currents from Bay of Bengal and sometimes from Arabian Sea.When these two currents meet over the region, a lot of rain takes place,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.North India (or northwest India) is a meteorological region comprising states/UTs of J&K, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and Rajasthan. Mohapatra said most of the extreme rain events in north India had taken place in the two hill states and the UT of J&K.The extreme rainfall data for the region reveals that while Aug last year had more 'heavy' (64.4-115.5mm) and 'very heavy' (115.5-204.4mm) rain events, it recorded far less number of 'extremely heavy' rainfall episodes than Aug this year. Last year, north India had reported its wettest month of Aug in 28 years since 1996, with the region as a whole logging 256.4mm of rain. The current month has so far (till Aug 26) reported 209.4mm, with five days still to go.""Due to formation of a trough in eastern Pakistan, the region has received a lot of rain in the past four days. The spell is likely to continue for one or two more days,"" Mohapatra said.The last three days have been the wettest in north India this monsoon season, with August 25 alone logging 21.8mm of rain, four times higher than the normal of 5.6mm for the day.","At 21% above normal, north India has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013.

MYSURU: A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Saligrama taluk, Mysuru district, Saturday.According to police, the 20-year-old woman, married and has a two-year-old child, was found with her mouth and right part of her face ripped open in what seemed to be a controlled blast triggered by an unidentified device. When police arrived, Darshitha was found dead in a pool of blood on the floor of the hotel room in Bherya village, 55km from Mysuru city.Police claimed the suspect, Siddaraju, from Bettadapura in Periyapatna, had brought Darshitha from Hunsur's Gerasanahalli to visit a temple. He allegedly plotted the murder of Darshitha as she refused to marry him, according to police. They reportedly knew each other for 7 years. Siddaraju worked at a hardware shop, while she lived with her parents at Gerasanahalli. Her husband lives in Kerala.Police suspect the accused may have used a pressure-triggering object or electricity to kill her. It's suspected Siddaraju may have electrocuted her by forcibly inserting a cable into her mouth and turning the power switch on, as a two-metre electric cable was recovered from the spot.Siddaraju allegedly attempted to carry Darshitha's body on his shoulder.The hotel staff asked him not to move the body until police arrived, police stated.Mysuru superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana said police are being assisted by a forensic science expert to identify the object used to kill the woman. He ruled out the use of gelatine sticks or any combustible materials to injure and kill the woman. An investigation is being carried out to identify the object used to cause her severe bleeding in her mouth, which resulted in her death.According to lodge manager Manu, the duo arrived seeking a room around 2pm Saturday. Siddaraju introduced Darshitha as his wife. He went out to get food, returned with a parcel in a plastic cover about 30 minutes later and claimed the room was locked from inside.Immediately, lodge staff force-opened the door. To their shock, they found Darshitha dead in a pool of blood.Manu appeared to suggest it was a mysterious blast since there was no sound of an explosion and there were no traces of gunpowder inside the room.","A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Mysuru district.

Stock market today: The stock market fell sharply on Tuesday triggered by heavy selling pressure after the United States issued a draft notice implementing an additional 25% on Indian exports.BSE benchmark Sensex dipped below the 81,000 mark, shredding over 800 points, while Nifty also plunged 1% as investor’s sentiments were weakened by persistent foreign fund outlaws and a weak global trend.The 30-share BSE Sensex slipped 849.37 points, or 1.04%, to close at 80,786.54.

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

New Delhi: Govt Tuesday directed telecommunications service providers (TSP) to “implement exclusion zones in and around airports for installation and operation of C band 5G international mobile telecom stations” to avoid potentially catastrophic interference from 5G signals to aircraft systems — including radio altimeters that measure a plane’s aircraft's height above the terrain directly below it. This essentially means TSPs will have to install low power 5G antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.The Union aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had last Nov suggested revised exclusion zones for ensuring safe landings and take offs. “The matter has been under deliberation of the department of telecommunications (DoT), civil aviation (ministry or MoCA) and DGCA.. the revised exclusion zones recommended (by) MoCA have been agreed as an interim measure till the upgradation or retrofitting of radio altimeters,” a DoT order issued Tuesday said.People in the know said aviation agencies in India had objected to rollout of 5G near airports due to aviation safety reasons. A radio altimeter giving a wrong reading can even lead to a crash. A paper by Boeing titled “5G radio altimeter interference” says: “Governments around the world are implementing 5G cellular systems in frequency ranges adjacent to or near the radio frequency band used by radio altimeters.The aviation industry and aviation regulators are concerned these 5G deployments will cause interference to radio altimeters… Concerns are based on a study done by industry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (which) concluded 5G transmissions can interfere with radio altimeters. ” As a result of this study, alerts for 5G interference were issued by the Civil Aviation Authorities of France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia, Oman and UAE.Several advanced countries have safeguards for this with rules from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European and European Union Aviation Safety Agency. India will also have similar safeguards and as an interim measure there will not be high powered 5G antennae near runways,” they said.The aviation authorities in India suggested an “envelope” near runways and prescribed the minimum distance at which certain low powered 5G antennae can be installed. The DoT order issued Tuesday to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone and BSNL added, “Hence, (an earlier) DoT letter is suppressed and the exclusion zones (no C band and buffer zones) stands revised. TSPs are permitted to install and operate C band 5G/IMT services in frequency band 3300- 3670 MHz in and around airport areas as per the revised exclusion zone and technical conditions. ”",Government orders telecom service providers to install low power 5G antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.

Is there merit in this criticism against ED?

What SC had said about ED

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah 's ""morality pitch"" to back the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025 met a strong counter from Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal who accused the Modi government of ""weaponising"" laws to target the opposition.""I don't think in the history of India, there has been a government which is more constitutionally immoral than this government. Can the home minister talk about constitutional morality after the way the governments in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Goa and Madhya Pradesh, among other places, were toppled,"" Sibal claimed. ""You can fool some people sometimes but you cannot fool all the people all the time,"" the Independent Rajya Sabha member added.On the last day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Amit Shah had introduced the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill - which proposes automatic removal of Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers if they are arrested and detained for 30 consecutive days on charges punishable by five years or more imprisonment. The three bills - Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025; and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025 - were referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.Amit Shah strongly defended the bills stating they were aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust. The Union home minister also emphasised that the bills, would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.However, his assurances failed to convince the opposition. Sibal reacted sharply to Shah's remarks and claimed that ""constitutional morality has nothing to do with their own morality"" and has everything to do with the morality of the opposition.""I was surprised by the home minister’s (Amit Shah) remark that the bill was introduced for morality. The home minister should stop talking about morality and tell the public if any BJP government minister has been arrested and jailed even for a day,"" he said.Earlier, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had alleged that the BJP planned to use the Bills to engage in ""satta chori"" so that it could ""topple opposition governments within 30 days"" and ""destabilise"" democracy by using arrest as a weapon.So, why is the opposition against the proposed legislation?The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non-BJP governments. Sibal claimed that no minister in the BJP governments at the Centre or in states have been arrested in the last 10 years while probe agencies had targeted opposition leaders one after the another.The former Union law minister cited the examples of AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal, Satyendar Jain and Manish Sisodia, the Congress' P Chidambaram, D K Shivakumar and Alamgir Alam, and JMM's Hemant Soren, among others, saying they had been arrested for over a month and then got bail much later, with the trial not concluding even after years.""No trial is complete. The home minister knows that when the PMLA and CBI get after them, nobody is granted bail. Even the Supreme Court had remarked -- why trial courts are not granting bail. And in the meantime, your political career is destroyed. The whole purpose of these laws is to weaponise laws for destabilising governments of opposition parties,"" Sibal alleged.NCP (SP) leader Rohit Pawar fears the Bill would be misused to target politicians of opposition parties. ""The government uses investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for political vendetta rather than genuine anti-corruption efforts. There are many BJP leaders on whom we have proved corruption, but the government is doing nothing about it,"" the NCP(SP)leader says and adds: ""98 per cent of the ED's actions are targeted against the opposition. It's no longer an independent body, it’s working on behalf of the government. It was expected to work against corruption across the board, not just the opposition,"" the NCP(SP) leader said.Pending cases against non-BJP ministers and ex-chief ministers:Sibal cited these examples to slam Amit Shah’s claim of speedy justice in matters related to jailed ministers.In March this year, the Union government had informed Parliament that the ED had registered 193 cases against political leaders over the past ten years. Of these, just two cases led to convictions, while no case resulted in an acquittal on merits.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-2-convictions-in-193-ed-cases-against-politicians-in-10-years-centre/articleshow/119217677.cmsAccording to the data, the highest number of such cases, 32, were lodged between April 2022 and March 2023. The second highest, 27, were recorded between April 2020 and March 2021, and again between April 2023 and March 2024. Additionally, 26 cases were registered in both 2019-2020 and 2021-2022.The government, however, denied any vendetta and said: ""The financial crimes probe agency takes up cases “based on credible material and not political affiliations, religion or otherwise.”The Supreme Court had earlier this year made some very strong observations about the functioning of the Enforcement Directorate. The top court had reminded the central agency that it must function strictly within the bounds of the law and said: ""You can’t act like a crook.""Highlighting concerns about the agency’s low conviction rate, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan had said: ""You can't act like a crook, you have to act within the four corners of the law. I observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered around 5,000 ECIRs (enforcement case information report) in the past five years but the conviction rate is less than 10 per cent. We are also concerned about ED’s image. After 5–6 years of custody, if people are acquitted, who takes responsibility?”While the government's intent of not allowing politicians to run governments from jail is indeed praiseworthy, the track record of investigative agencies, especially the ED, gives credence to opposition claims that the proposed legislation will be used to target them. What's more - the opposition claims that the BJP can use these Bills to target even its allies - Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar - in future.(With inputs from agencies)","The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non- BJP governments. Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal accused the Modi government of ""weaponising"" laws to target the opposition.

India Had Planes Before Wright Brothers: Shivraj Sparks Debate After Anurag's 'Astronaut' Hanuman

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday sidestepped questions about the possibility of him becoming the next BJP president, saying his focus in entirely on boosting agricultural production and improving farmers' income.When asked about his reported meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in New Delhi over the past weekend sparking speculation about a potential BJP president candidacy, Chouhan reiterated that he was focused on his ministerial duties, news agency PTI reported.""I want to say one thing -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi has entrusted me with the responsibility of looking after ministries of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Rural Development. At this moment, agriculture is in every pore of my body and farmers are in my breath,” Chouhan said.He added that, like the eyes of a bird, he had only one goal: to increase agricultural production, boost farmers’ income, develop rural areas and create more Lakhpati Didis.A Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group (SHG) whose household earns over Rs 1 lakh annually.When pressed further about the BJP president post, Chouhan said, “Neither have I ever thought of it, nor has anyone told me. I can't even think of it.I am the Agriculture and Rural Development Minister. I am doing this work like worship. Serving farmers is worship of God for me and I want to keep doing this worship.”Chouhan, 66, a prominent OBC leader, has served as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh four times and is known for his strong grassroots connect.After leading the BJP to a decisive victory in the November 2023 Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, he resigned from the state assembly and won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls from Vidisha, subsequently joining Prime Minister Modi’s third-term Cabinet.The three-year term of the current BJP president, JP Nadda, had ended around two years ago.

Noida dowry murder case: Father of Nikki Bhati makes shocking claim

Cheteshwar Pujara retires: How much pension will he earn each month?

In the last 24 hours, India witnessed a series of major developments — from heavy rains in Jammu and Kashmir triggering a landslide on the route to the Vaishno Devi shrine atop Trikuta hill, to the Noida dowry case where the victim’s father alleged he gave Rs 1.5 lakh for setting up a beauty parlour, but her in-laws “did not even allow her to put up a signboard. ” On the global front, US tariffs have posed a significant trade challenge for India, impacting nearly 66% of Indian exports to the US, worth around $86.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy marked a key milestone, and in sports, Cheteshwar Pujara, the former Indian Test cricket stalwart, announced his retirement after a distinguished career of 103 matches.Here are top 5 stories:At least five people died and 14 were injured after a landslide struck the Vaishno Devi shrine route near Adhkwari in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district on Tuesday. The incident, triggered by relentless rainfall, occurred midway on the 12-km trek, leading to suspension of the yatra. Rescue operations with manpower and machinery are underway. Read more In a landmark development, the Indian Navy on Tuesday commissioned two state-of-the-art stealth frigates, INS Udaygiri and INS Himgiri, at Visakhapatnam in the presence of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. This is the first time two frontline warships built at different shipyards—Udaygiri at Mazagon Dock (Mumbai) and Himgiri at GRSE (Kolkata)—were inducted together.Part of the advanced Project 17A class, the frigates enhance Blue Water combat capabilities with stealth features, upgraded weapons, sensors, and propulsion systems. The event also marked Udaygiri as the 100th warship designed by the Navy’s Warship Design Bureau, underscoring India’s growing indigenous shipbuilding expertise.

A draft notification from the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed the move, impacting $60.2 billion worth of Indian exports—including textiles, jewellery, shrimp, carpets, and furniture. According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), labour-intensive sectors could see export volumes drop by up to 70%. The duties cover nearly 66% of India’s total exports to the US, worth $86.5 billion. Beneficiaries are likely to be rival exporters from China, Vietnam, and Mexico.

Mumbai:

Mumbai: Bombay high court on Tuesday stated that public places cannot be occupied indefinitely, and Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange cannot hold a protest at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai without prior permission from authorities. The high court mentioned that while democracy and dissent are cut from the same cloth, demonstrations should only be held at designated places, reports Swati Deshpande.The HC bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that protests cannot be held at prime city locations without proper clearance from authorities. The high court was hearing a PIL filed by Amy Foundation that challenged the proposed protests by Jarange. High court issued notice to Jarange for his response and posted the matter to Sept 9.Jarange reinstated his determination to proceed with a march to Mumbai, set to begin Wednesday from Jalna's Antarwali Sarati village. tnn","Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange cannot hold a protest at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai without prior permission from authorities.

HCs yet to comply with SC's timeline on reserved verdicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hcs-yet-to-comply-with-scs-timeline-on-reserved-verdicts/articleshow/123534915.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court may have fixed timeline for the President and the governors for taking a decision on bills passed by state assemblies, but has not been able over nearly 24 years to get high courts to comply with its 2001 judgment laying guidelines on speedier pronouncement of verdicts reserved in cases.In 2001, SC in Anil Rai case noticed the troubling practice among HC judges reserving verdicts only to forget to pronounce judgments or pronounce only operating portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later, which in some cases went abegging.To eradicate the anomaly of keeping judgments reserved for months and in some cases years, SC laid down five-point guidelines that mandated the chief justices of HCs to remind the judges if they had not pronounced decisions within two months of reserving the verdict. SC also allowed the litigants to apply for early pronouncement of a judgment, if it was not delivered within three months of reserving it.The non-implementation of the guidelines was noticed on Monday by a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra, who were shocked to discover that an Allahabad HC bench has not delivered judgment for almost a year.Justice Mishra said, ""In most of HCs, there is no mechanism where the litigant can approach the concerned bench or the chief justice bringing to its notice the delay in delivery of judgment.In such a situation, the litigant loses his faith in the judicial process defeating the ends of justice.""While reiterating the guidelines for expeditious pronouncement of judgment by HCs as laid down in 2001, the bench said, ""If the judgment is not delivered within three months, Registrar General shall place the matters before the CJ for orders and the CJ shall bring it to the notice of the concerned bench for pronouncing the order within two weeks thereafter, failing which the matter be assigned to another bench.""Significantly, the problem is not restricted to HCs. SC has been unable to find the cure for the same problem within its own houses, with too many instances of judgments having been reserved for months. Justice A S Oka delivered the judgment on a long pending dispute between two factions of ISKCON after keeping it reserved for almost a year.","Supreme Court has not been able over nearly 24 years to get high courts to comply with its 2001 judgment laying guidelines on speedier pronouncement of verdicts reserved in cases.

Shadow schooling booming as 33% of kids take private coaching: Government report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shadow-schooling-booming-as-33-of-kids-take-private-coaching-government-report/articleshow/123534882.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Nearly one in three school students in India now takes private coaching, with the practice far more common in urban areas, according to latest Comprehensive Modular Survey (CMS) on education released by govt. The findings sketch a system where government schools remain central in rural India while urban families increasingly prefer private schools and supplement classroom learning with paid coaching.The survey, carried out by ministry of statistics and programme implementation as part of 80th round of the National Sample Survey, covered over 52,000 households and nearly 58,000 students to assess household expenditure on schooling and tutoring.Govt schools still dominate nationally, accounting for 55.9% of enrolments, but their reach is stronger in villages, where two-thirds of children study. In cities, only 30.1% attend govt schools, with parents showing a clear preference for private unaided institutions. Private schools account for almost a third of enrolments nationwide, with their share particularly significant in urban areas, where higher incomes and aspirations drive choice.The financial gap is stark. Families with children in govt schools spend on average Rs 2,863 per student annually, while those in non-govt schools spend nearly nine times more at Rs 25,002. Only a quarter of govt school students reported paying course fees, compared to 95.7% in private schools, rising to 98% in urban unaided institutions. Across categories - fees, uniforms and books - urban families spend far more, with average course fees at Rs 15,143 per student against Rs 3,979 in rural households.Private coaching has become a major burden. The survey found 27% of students took coaching this year, rising to 30.7% in urban areas and 25.5% in rural. City households spend an average Rs 3,988 per child annually, rural families Rs 1,793. At higher secondary, city families spend Rs 9,950 per student, twice rural average of Rs 4,548. Coaching costs climb steadily, from Rs 525 at pre-primary to Rs 6,384 at higher secondary.The survey also highlighted how education is financed. Across India, 95% of students said the main source of funding was household members. Govt scholarships were cited by just 1.2%.What emerges is a dual narrative - government schools remain backbone of rural education, while urban parents lean toward private institutions and coaching. This twin trend of private schooling and shadow education reflects both aspirations and inequalities at a time when NEP seeks equitable & affordable access to quality education.","Government schools still dominate nationally, accounting for 55.9% of enrolments.

Elevating Patna HC CJ will be counter-productive: SC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elevating-patna-hc-cj-will-be-counter-productive-sc-judge/articleshow/123534855.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court judge Justice B V Nagarathna has strongly dissented against the collegium's decision to elevate Patna high court chief justice Vipul Manubhai Pancholi to the top court, saying the move would be ""counter-productive"" to the judiciary.The five-member collegium, comprising CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, J K Maheshwari and Nagarathna, had on Aug 25 recommended names of Bombay HC chief justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Pancholi for elevation as SC judges. Justice Pancholi, if appointed, would be in line to become CJI in Oct 2031 after Justice Joymalya Bagchi's retirement.Justice Nagarathna, the sole woman judge in SC, opposed the move citing Pancholi's lower seniority and circumstances surrounding his transfer from Gujarat HC to Patna HC in July 2023. She noted that the transfer was ""not a routine one, but a carefully considered decision taken after consultation with several senior judges, all of whom concurred"".According to sources, she also underlined concerns about regional representation in SC and warned that going ahead with Pancholi's elevation could erode ""whatever credibility collegium system still holds"". Her dissent reportedly traces back to May when Pancholi's name was first considered.At that stage, Justice N V Anjaria was elevated ahead of him. When Pancholi's name resurfaced three months later, Nagarathna recorded her dissent.The development has triggered sharp reactions outside the court as well. NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) issued a statement saying the August 25 resolution ""makes a mockery of the earlier standards of transparency in judicial appointments"". It noted that the collegium had taken a 4-1 split decision in recommending Pancholi and questioned why he was chosen despite being only 57th in the all-India seniority list of HC judges.The CJAR statement also pointed out that Pancholi would be the third judge from Gujarat to be elevated to Supreme Court, which it said was ""disproportionate to the size of Gujarat HC"" while several other HCs remain unrepresented.Justice Nagarathna's dissent, the first against a proposed CJI-designate in recent years, has once again brought the collegium system and its credibility under sharp public focus.

New Delhi: From relaxation in loan repayment to loans backed by govt guarantees, interest subsidy and provident fund and ESIC support for employees, exporters are ready with a Covid-style wishlist that they are presenting to govt and RBI to tackle the challenge posed by the US tariffs.""This is an earthquake which will impact the workforce. Relief must be given to the industry,"" said Kirit Bhansali, chairman of Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council after a meeting with RBI on Tuesday. With payments likely to be delayed, he wants banks to go easy on loan repayment.Fieo is seeking a one-year moratorium on loan repayment, both principal and interest, arguing that it will enable exporters to direct resources towards market diversification & manage cash flows better at a time when they will be hit by fewer orders and extended payment cycles. Besides, it wants automatic 30% enhancement of credit limits to streamline working capital flows.""We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment. Govt is asking us to sell in the domestic market, how do we do that with goods that were meant for the US?"" said Fieo president S C Ralhan, ahead of his meetings with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal.Multiple agencies are also pitching for support from the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation.Apparel Export Promotion Council's (AEPC) asks are from multiple agencies - RBI and different ministries, from textiles to commerce, finance, labour and environment.Citing ""high interest rates"" of 8-12% in India, compared with 3% in China and Malaysia, it wants the interest subvention scheme to be revived and the pre-shipment rupee export credit be reintroduced immediately for five years.It is demanding a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for new companies, support for expansion of garment units through a Textile Upgradation Fund Scheme-type facility and warehouses to store inventory overseas.Besides, it has made a case for govt to bear the employers' share of PF and ESIC contribution for workers in apparel units between Aug 2025 and March, 2026.Further, AEPC and Fieo have proposed skilling assistance for workers in export units. While RBI, as reported by TOI on Tuesday, is holding consultations on possible forbearance, govt is unwilling to offer major fiscal support, at least immediately and is exploring if domestic retailers and overseas buyers can assist exporters. The Centre also believes that reforms and steps such as GST cut will help bolster domestic demand and come to the rescue of Indian players hit by US tariffs.","Fieo is seeking a one-year moratorium on loan repayment, both principal and interest.

New Delhi: The conviction of two persons in the 2012 rape-murder of a 12-year-old girl in UP was overturned by Supreme Court on Tuesday, after the duo had spent 13 years in jail. One of them was sentenced to death and the other life imprisonment.The apex court pulled up police for a shabby investigation. A bench of justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta quashed the 2018 Allahabad HC order, by which the conviction and sentence awarded by a trial court in 2014 was upheld, and directed that the two be released forthwith. It said the HC had made a grave error in placing reliance on the evidence, including DNA profiling, which had glaring discrepancies.The only evidence against the two was that clothes and other items belonging to the girl were found in the agricultural field of the main accused and a comb found near the body allegedly belonged to the second accused. SC noted that these were not sent for forensic examination.""...The scientific analysis of these articles might have provided vital evidence for proving the guilt of the accused-appellants or otherwise.The very fact that the investigating officer (Narad Muni Singh) did not consider it essential to send the articles to FSL gives rise to a strong suspicion that the recovery of these articles was a planted recovery,"" SC said. The court also noted that recovery of the victim's underwear was not initially mentioned in the report. It said the omission was far too significant to be overlooked. ""...the same seems to be a planted recovery and a creation by the investigating officer intended to give succor to the prosecution case,"" SC said.""We feel that the present case is yet another classic example of lacklustre and shabby investigation and so also laconic trial procedure which has led to the failure of a case involving brutal rape and murder of an innocent girl child,"" it said.",The apex court pulled up police for a shabby investigation.

The remarks came ahead of PM Narendra Modi ’s visit to Japan this week, during which the 2 sides will review cooperation to promote a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.Significantly, the US joined India in reaffirming in a joint statement its commitment to promoting a safer, stronger and more Indo-Pacific region through the Quad in a virtual 2 + 2 Intersessional Dialogue between senior officials this week.Misri said that Quad cooperation will be discussed when Modi meets his Japan counterpart Shigeru Ishiba for the annual India-Japan visit on Friday. Modi will depart on Thursday for a 2-day visit to Japan en route to China.Some of the likely outcomes from Modi’s visit to Japan include an upgrade of the 2008 joint declaration on security cooperation to make it more in sync with current realities and an announcement, as reported by the Japanese media last week, by Japan about investment worth $ 68 billion in India over the next 10 years.The 2 sides will look to boost defence and security cooperation with focus on defence exercises and technology transfer, while also launching an economic security initiative.During the visit, Modi is also likely to travel in a bullet train from Tokyo to Sendai where he’s expected to visit a semiconductor facility.Japan is also hoping that India and the US will be able to resolve their differences in time for a successful Quad summit later this year. With India-US ties in a flux, it’s anybody’s guess as to whether President Donald Trump will visit India for the summit this year.Misri said that in recent years, Quad’s agenda has expanded to take on issues of practical cooperation and health security. “It covers critical and emerging technologies. There's an initiative with regard to critical minerals that has been discussed recently. Overall, with regard to how to make supply chains more resilient, and also infrastructure development. So, these are all issues that are a priority, both for India and for Japan,” said Misri.“Both our countries attach high value to this forum and to this partnership. And we look forward to working with all Quad partners to take our cooperation forward. I'm sure when the two prime ministers meet, the Quad will be a subject that will be discussed between the two of them,’’ he added.",Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Quad cooperation will be discussed when Modi meets his Japan counterpart Shigeru Ishiba on Friday.

India seeks SCO condemnation of cross-border terror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeks-sco-condemnation-of-cross-border-terror/articleshow/123534083.cms,"Vikram Misri

New Delhi: Ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Tianjin in China for the SCO summit, govt on Tuesday said India was seeking a strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the Tianjin declaration, the joint statement that will follow the summit.Senior officials recalled that when SCO was established, one of its main objectives was to counter challenges to peace and security arising from terrorism, separatism and extremism.MEA secretary (west) Tanmaya Lal, in a joint briefing with foreign secretary Vikram Misri, said while the declaration text was still being finalised, India was working with other member-states to ensure there was a reiteration of the strong condemnation of terrorism.This will be the first meeting of the SCO leaders after the Pahalgam attack and India expects the declaration to reflect the solidarity expressed by the international community. It remains to be seen, however, if there is any mention of Pahalgam in the joint statement as Pakistan is likely to either oppose it, or insist on the mention of terrorist activities on its soil for which it might have blamed India.Modi is expected to reach China on Aug 30 for the SCO summit. On the margins, he is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Chinese and Russian presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.","India is seeking a strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the Tianjin declaration, the joint statement that will follow the summit.

New Delhi: Recalling PM Narendra Modi's 2025 I-Day speech that flagged demographic changes in border villages caused by illegal immigration ""as part of a deliberate design"", home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday urged the collectors of districts covered under the Vibrant Village Programme (VVP), chief secretaries of border states and central armed police forces (CAPFs) to pay attention to the problem and address it suitably.Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day VVP workshop being organised by Union home ministry here, Shah urged the collectors/district magistrates of border districts to take appropriate action to remove illegal encroachments within a 30-km radius of the border, including religious structures that often come up as ""part of a deliberate design"" to alter demography of surrounding areas. He cited the example of Gujarat, saying it had cleared numerous encroachments along both maritime and land borders.""Demographic changes in border areas directly impact security of the country and its borders. It should not be assumed that this is happening due to geographical conditions; rather, it is occurring as part of a deliberate design,"" Shah told the conference attended by junior home minister Bandi Sanjay Kumar, senior MHA officials, the Intelligence Bureau director, chief secretary of border states covered under VVP, DG of border forces and collectors of border districts.The minister exhorted DMs of VVP districts to address the illegal immigration and encroachment issue ""with seriousness and attention to detail"". The same suggestion was made to state chief secretaries and CAPF chiefs.Stating that VVP had led to infrastructure development in target villages, preservation and enhancement of culture, and employment generation through tourism, making village life vibrant, Shah said it was the responsibility of chief secretaries, district authorities and CAPFs to consider what additional steps can be taken, beyond VVP, to transform border villages into significant tools of security.He said it was the responsibility of CAPFs and district collectors to establish dairy cooperatives to meet the milk requirements of CAPFs and the Army directly from the villages, thus aiding in employment generation.Commending the population rise in Arunachal's border villages since VVP's launch, Shah said locals would not seek to migrate if they got facilities and employment opportunities in their own village. He said if initiatives like homestays were extended to border villages and state tourism departments made proper arrangements for bookings, every household would have employment.Shah said to achieve 100% saturation of govt schemes, district collectors should consider coordinating with CAPFs. He said CAPFs could provide assistance in areas of health, sports and education.",PM Narendra Modi's 2025 I-Day speech flagged demographic changes in border villages caused by illegal immigration.

New Delhi: Maharashtra, through senior lawyer Harish Salve, told Supreme Court on Tuesday that the Constitution empowers a governor or the President, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill. It made a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai ask: ""Is this the federal governance structure envisaged by Constitution framers?""Making good his argument, Salve, who has moved to the UK and is now the King's Counsel, told the bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution mandates that the President will always be bound by the aid and advice of the Union council of ministers led by the PM but there is no such provision of aid and advice by state council of ministers for a governor on a bill passed by an assembly.He said when a governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President, the latter will either grant or withhold assent based on the advice of the PM-led council of ministers. If a governor or the President withholds assent, the bill falls through, Salve said, adding that the framers of the Constitution intended a federal governance where Parliament/President will have the last word on framing of laws, not the assemblies.","Senior lawyer Harish Salve told Supreme Court that the Constitution empowers a governor or the President, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill.

As additional tariffs imposed on India made landfall on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump once again asserted that he prevented a nuclear war between New Delhi and Islamabad by threatening crippling tariffs and halting trade deals unless the two countries agreed to a ceasefire.Speaking during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he threatened India with steep tariffs and refused to proceed with a trade deal unless the conflict was resolved.“I am talking to a very terrific man, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. I said what's going on with you and Pakistan... The hatred was tremendous. This has been going on for a hell of a long time, like, sometimes with different names for hundreds of years,” Trump said.Trump went on to say that he issued a warning during a call with PM Modi, “I said, I don't want to make a trade deal with you... You guys are going to end up in a nuclear war... I said, call me back tomorrow, but we're not going to do any deals with you, or we're going to put tariffs on you that are so high, your head's going to spin.”Trump claimed that within five hours of the conversation, both sides had backed down. “It was done. Now maybe it starts again.I don't know. I don't think so, but I'll stop it if it does. We can't let these things happen,” he said.The US President also reiterated his claim that the conflict had resulted in the downing of several military aircraft. “That's not good, that's a lot of jets. 150 million dollar planes were shot down, a lot of them - seven, maybe it could be higher, they never revealed the true numbers,” he said, without providing evidence or citing official sources.Drawing a parallel with the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump said the India-Pakistan situation had the potential to escalate into a global crisis. “Just like Russia and Ukraine were going to pull the world into World War, India and Pakistan were going to end in nuclear war,” he said.Trump has made similar claims in the past, saying his intervention prevented an all-out war between the two South Asian rivals. However, India has repeatedly denied any third-party involvement in the de-escalation.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier said that the ceasefire was a result of India's own strategic decisions and that no external pressure was a factor.PM Modi himself last month in Parliament categorically refuted the claims of any third party mediation, so have other senior ministers including external affairs minister S Jaishankar and home minister Amit Shah.",US President Donald Trump claims he prevented a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

New Delhi: Supreme Court ordered on Tuesday an inquiry into the disclosure by a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma, that he was approached by ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" to decide a case in favour of a particular litigant.Sources told TOI that the inquiry would be conducted by the secretary general of the apex court to find out who was the judge, from HCs or SC, who allegedly attempted to influence the outcome of a case.

This year, Sadhguru, founder of the Isha Foundation, undertook the Yatra in a historic first — on a motorbike — demonstrating resilience after undergoing two major brain surgeries last year.On his 17-day journey, Sadhguru engaged with actors, cricketer Varun Chakravarthy, and filmmaker Nag Ashwin, sharing insights on life, spirituality, and recovery. He credited yoga for his physical endurance and recounted completing a Trans-Canada motorcycle ride to prepare for the Himalayan terrain, promising doctors “No jerks, no bumps, no falls.”During conversations en route, Kangana Ranaut asked about Shiva, to which Sadhguru replied, “I sit on his shoulders, so everything is fine,” highlighting experiential spirituality. To R. Madhavan , he described Kailash as “the greatest mystical library on the planet and in the known universe,” emphasising its spiritual significance.Sadhguru also reflected on the broader role of regional cooperation: “Geographically congruent nations must come together… function geographically as one unit though politically and otherwise we are separate.” Speaking to Nag Ashwin, he urged young people to embrace spiritual growth early, noting it should not be reserved for later in life.","The reopening of the Kailash Yatra route through Tibet has allowed Indian pilgrims to undertake the spiritual journey.

Delhi Polls: Kejriwal Attacks Election Commissioner; Shah Says People Will Sweep AAP Out With Broom

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday shot off a barbed response to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s recent interview, in which the BJP leader defended the government's 130th constitutional amendment bill.The bill proposes the removal of lawmakers detained or arrested for more than 30 days in cases carrying a punishment of five years or more.In the interview with news agency ANI, Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister—accused of corruption or facing charges with more than five years’ punishment -- to run the government from jail?""Responding to the Union home minister's question, Kejriwal posed a counter question asking: ""And what about a leader who inducts hardened criminals into his party, helps them wipe off their cases, and then rewards them with positions like minister, deputy chief minister, or even chief minister—should such a minister or prime minister not also be forced to step down? How many years of imprisonment should such a person face?""The AAP convenor further asked: ""Finally, if someone is falsely implicated in a case, sent to jail, and later acquitted, how many years of jail should the minister responsible for framing that false case get?""Kerjiwal had refused to step down as Delhi CM when he was jailed over the alleged scam linked to the scrapped Delhi liquor policy and continued to serve as chief minister from Tihar jail.Referring to the incident, Shah said: ""When the constitution was made, the constitution makers would not have imagined such shamelessness that any CM would go to jail and remain the CM from jail.""Shah said Kejriwal continued to serve as CM as the Delhi high court ruled that there was no provision in the law to remove him from the post.""When the case went to the high court, it was argued that Arvind Kejriwal should resign because he is in jail.The high Court said that we believe that he should resign on moral grounds but there is no provision in the current law. My party believes, the Prime Minister of the country believes that no CM, minister or PM in this country can run the government while being in jail,"" the Union home minister said.Kejriwal attacked Amit Shah over his statement, saying his 160-day government from jail was better than the current BJP-led Delhi government.""When the Centre conspired to frame me in false cases and sent me to jail, I ran the government for 160 days from behind bars. In the past seven months, the BJP government in Delhi has dragged the city into such a mess that people now recall those jail days of governance. At least back then, the power and water were available, medicines were free in hospitals and mohalla clinics, medical tests were free, one spell of rain didn’t throw the city into chaos, and private schools weren’t given a free hand to extort and bully parents,"" the ex-Delhi CM said.BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at Kejriwal over his remark, saying: ""During Covid we worked from home. Now they want 'Work from Jail' for the 1st time in India. Can a CM hold meetings from prison? Where will public hearings be held — inside jail rooms? How will we cope if their is any emergency? This fails both on morality and practicality.""In the interview, Shah also expressed confidence that the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, will be passed, despite the opposition's fierce criticism.Shah said it's aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust, emphasising that the bill would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.""I am sure it will be passed. There will be many people in the Congress party and in the opposition who will support morality and maintain the moral ground,"" he said.""The Prime Minister himself has included the post of PM in this... Earlier, Indira Gandhi had brought the 39th amendment (of protecting the President, VP, PM, and Speaker from judicial review by Indian courts)...Narendra Modi ji has brought a constitutional amendment against himself that if the Prime Minister goes to jail, he will have to resign,"" Shah added.Currently, the bill has been referred to a JPC for detailed scrutiny, comprising 31 members from both houses of Parliament. The committee will examine the bill and provide recommendations before it is put to vote.","Union home minister Amit Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister"" to run the government from jail.

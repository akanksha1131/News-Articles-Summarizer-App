My party made me go here and there a couple of times earlier, but this is not going to happen again. Who made me CM?

Pak Army Hit By Ammunition Shortage; Artillery Stockpile Near Zero Amid War Fear | India Ready!

NEW DELHI: The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan had asked for an emergency meeting on the issue. Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, which is being led by Greece for the month of May.Pakistan ""requested closed consultations"" over the growing tensions, and the Greek Presidency scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon.Pakistan said on Sunday that it will ""inform"" the UNSC about what it called India's ""aggressive actions"".""Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India's aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,"" the Pakistan's foreign office said.""Pakistan will specifically highlight India's illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,"" it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi's actions are jeopardising ""peace and security"" in the region.The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power: China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US. The ten non-permanent members are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia.Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. The Permanent Representative of Greece to the UN and the Security Council president for May, Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, said last week that a meeting should take place if there is a request.""Then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit of tension,"" Sekeris said.""We are in close contact...but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing,"" he added.News agency PTI reported that when it asked Sekeris about India being affected by cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, which is now on the Council, and the need to deal with terrorism, he said, ""It’s an issue which is very pertinent.""He added, ""As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did"" on the ""heinous terrorist attack"" in Pahalgam, in which civilians were killed.Sekeris further said, ""We express our condolences to the government of India, Nepal and the families of victims. This is a position of principle. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, everywhere it is happening. On the other hand, we are concerned about this tension which is mounting in the region. Two very big countries. Of course, India is far more bigger"" than Pakistan.After the Pahalgam attack in which 26 civilians died, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke with all Council members except China and Pakistan, as per a report by the news agency PTI.He told them that ""its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice.""Jaishankar had a ""good conversation"" with Greek foreign minister George Gerapetritis and ""discussed the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""India welcomed Greece’s strong stand against cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar said their ""Strategic Partnership reflects the depth of our ties.""He also spoke with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the foreign ministers of Russia, the US, the UK, France, South Korea, Denmark, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Guyana, Slovenia, Somalia, and Panama.Last Friday, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said at a press conference that Pakistan has the right to ask for a meeting when it feels it is needed.""We see that all of this that is happening is in the context, in the backdrop of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Ahmad said.""Here it is evident that there was an incident but now what has evolved in terms of the situation which is a real threat to regional and international peace and security, and we believe that the Security Council, in fact, has the mandate, and it would be very legitimate for any member of the Council, including Pakistan, to request a meeting, a discussion of the Security Council, to consider this very serious situation that has evolved. We have discussed that with the Council members. We have discussed that with the in fact, the previous, last month’s presidency, and this month’s presidency. We are observing the situation very closely, and we have the right to convene a meeting when we feel appropriate,"" he added.Ahmad also met UN Secretary General Guterres last week and gave him a briefing about the situation in the region.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 24 said that the people behind the Pahalgam terror attack and those supporting them will be punished. In a meeting on April 29 with senior defence officials, Modi said that the armed forces have ""complete operational freedom"" to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported, quoting government sources.","The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan.

Residents fear the worst as desilting work lags in Delhi

Poll Should the deadline for desilting work be extended to ensure completion before the monsoon? No, it should stay as is Yes, it should be extended

NEW DELHI: MCD's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by April 25. With the initial deadline for finishing the work set for May 31, the progress so far appears insufficient.Of the target of 1.3 lakh metric tonnes to be lifted and taken to designated sites by May end, only 27,000 MT was cleared from drains more than 4 feet deep, as per the report.The civic body didn't comment on the issue while several RWAs reported that no desilting had taken place in their localities. To meet the target, the pace needs to be significantly increased, they said. Desilting is done in two phases. Phase I is carried out before monsoon from Jan 1 to May 31, when 60% of the cleaning is done to mitigate the chances of waterlogging during the rainy season.The deadline for this is often extended to June 15. Phase II of the work is taken up post-monsoon to ensure uninterrupted flow of drains.The civic body is working in all 12 zones in the capital after engaging machinery and equipment. There are 800 drains over 4ft deep in MCD's jurisdiction, spread over a 530km area.As of now, work is on at 253 places, while work at none of the drains has been completed yet.""In phase I, the civic body targeted to lift 1,29,392.8 metric tonnes of silt, and of this, 27,589 MT of silt was removed by April 25, which amounts to 21.3%,"" as per the report seen by TOI.In phase II this year, the silt removal target has been set at 84,466.6 MT. This has taken the total target of MCD for removing silt in 2025-26 to 2,13,859.5 MT.Besides, work is on at drains in the residential colonies in the capital and those less than 4ft deep.""These drains are cleared throughout the year. There are 12,892 such drains spread over an area of 6,069.8km, with a target to remove 40,086 MT of silt. Of this, 9,474.8 MT has been achieved by the end of April, which accounts for 24% of the work,"" said the report.According to the report, 100% of the work has been done in Sadar Paharganj zone, followed by 57% in Najafgarh zone and 44.8% in Keshavpuram.Residents, however, said that the Friday morning downpour, accompanied by gusty winds, exposed the lack of preparedness of the Delhi govt and the municipal authorities.""Widespread waterlogging affected the city, particularly at known trouble spots. Internal lanes of New Friends Colony, Janakpuri and Azadpur were also flooded. I think authorities need to fix the problem and complete their task in coordination rather than later blaming each other for waterlogging,"" said A N Gupta, a resident of Janakpuri.MCD reported 16 complaints of waterlogging from Vasant Vihar, Defence Colony, Pul Bangash, Fatehpur Beri, Shastri Bagh and Rana Pratap Bagh on Friday.""Complaints were received through email, call centre and hotline numbers. These were immediately conveyed to the staff and resolved,"" said the official.","MCD's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by April 25.

Poll Should drivers carry personal safety devices for protection against road rage? No, it's not necessary Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: An e-rickshaw driver was arrested for allegedly slashing a cabbie's neck with a blade in an incident of road rage in southwest Delhi's Dabri area.The victim, Gagandeep Singh (33), left bleeding and seriously injured, is recovering. Singh, who lives in Gurgaon's Sector 107, stopped his car at a red light on Dabri-Dwarka Road on way to his in-laws' house in Vikaspuri on the night of April 30. His mother was also in the cab.As they waited at the signal, an e-rickshaw hit the car from behind. When Singh stepped out and asked the e-rickshaw driver to drive more carefully, the man began threatening him before pulling out a blade concealed under his tongue and slashed his neck.The cabbie who was injured in an incident of road rage here tried to defuse the situation and attempted to reason with the driver of the e-rickshaw that hit his car. But instead of calming down, the accused suddenly attacked the cabbie, Gagandeep Singh.Despite bleeding heavily, Singh managed to call the police and reached Indira Gandhi Hospital on his own for treatment. Passers-by who witnessed the incident quickly intervened in the matter.They caught the attacker and detained him until the police arrived. The accused was later identified as Rajendra(23), a resident of Rajapuri in southwest Delhi.A senior police officer confirmed the arrest and said that a case was registered under appropriate sections of BNS for causing grievous hurt.The weapon used in the assault, a sharp blade, was recovered from his possession during the arrest.Gagandeep is currently recovering from his injuries, while police continue to investigate the background of the accused and whether he has a history of similar violent behaviour.In another incident of road rage that turned deadly last month, a 40-year-old motorcyclist was bludgeoned to death after his bike brushed against an SUV in west Delhi's Ranhola area.The 28-year-old car driver allegedly lured him to a secluded spot after an argument, killed him by hitting him on the head with a brick, and then dumped his body in a drain.The motorcyclist's body was found three days later, and the accused SUV driver was later arrested.","E-rickshaw driver arrested for allegedly slashing a cabbie's neck with a blade in an incident of road rage in southwest Delhi's Dabri area.

FMs reluctant to give up taxation powers

NEW DELHI: A bottle of alcohol that costs Rs 100 in Goa will set you back by Rs 305 in neighbouring Karnataka, Rs 229 in Telangana and Rs 205 in Rajasthan.The massive price variation is due to the different levels of excise duty and other taxes that states levy, with the trend of Goa having the lowest levies remaining unchanged. If anything, taxes in Goa have inched up compared to a few years ago. Goa levies the lowest excise of 55%, while the tax rises 80% in Karnataka, the highest in the country, according to data compiled by International Spirits & Wine Association of India.As a result, a bottle of popular Black Label whisky costs Rs 3,310 a bottle in Delhi, Rs 4,200 in Mumbai and around Rs 5,200 in Karnataka.The difference in duties defeats the 'one nation, one tax' principle, with finance ministers making no effort to correct the situation, amid calls from industry to rationalise taxes. It also results in states with higher taxes losing revenue to bootlegging.For instance, individuals in Delhi often hop across to Haryana to purchase alcohol as is the case in Tamil Nadu, where many people purchase liquor from Puducherry.With excise on liquor and VAT on petrol and diesel being the only major sources of revenue for states after the introduction of goods and services tax, finance ministers are reluctant to give up further taxation powers, especially in a season of freebies, when the tax is used to bridge the deficit.""While we recognise that the states have to augment their revenues, there is a need to build a sustainable model which focuses on stability and allows consumers to uptrade through premiumisation. This can be achieved through tax rationalisation and creating a pricing ladder that allows consumers to uptrade, thereby building the ethos of drink less, drink better. We have seen revenue growth in the past in states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where price correction through tax rationalisation has helped in incremental revenue growth that is sustainable,"" said Sanjit Padhi, CEO, ISWAI, the industry lobby representing global giants.Rival body Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Industry too has said that different tax levels across states is a big challenge for the industry. ""There is no cohesive strategy for the Indian alcoholic beverage industry. The industry needs a uniform taxation mechanism which will propel the growth,"" CIABC's Deepak Roy said recently.","A bottle of alcohol that costs Rs 100 in Goa will set you back by Rs 305 in neighbouring Karnataka.

"2 years on, Telangana gig workers' Bill catches Rajasthan's landmark law 'napping'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-on-telangana-gig-workers-bill-catches-rajasthans-landmark-law-napping/articleshow/120880033.cms,"2 years on, T’gana gig workers’ Bill catches Raj’s landmark law ‘napping’

Poll Do you support the implementation of social security for gig workers in Rajasthan? No Yes

JAIPUR: Congress-governed Telangana's draft Gig and Platform Workers (Registration, Social Security, and Welfare) Bill is reigniting a conversation that the party's erstwhile stronghold, Rajasthan, once led - only to let the momentum slip.As the desert state's pioneering 2023 Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act lies entangled in red tape, bike taxi rider Krishna Kumar Chaudhary wakes up each morning knowing exactly how his day will end - exhausted, barely breaking even, and unable to secure a better future for his son.For thousands like him in Rajasthan's gig economy , the 2023 law signalled hope that has since evaporated in the cycle of political transition, bureaucratic delay, and corporate pressures.Krishna Kumar, general secretary of the Rajasthan Gig and App-based Workers' Union, earns Rs 700-1,000 daily ferrying passengers on his motorbike. After accounting for platform fees (Rs 100), petrol (Rs 300 approx) and maintenance (Rs 100), he is left with a maximum of Rs 400.""My room rent alone is Rs 4,000 a month. I borrow from friends to survive. I want my son to study in a private school, but I can't afford it,"" Kumar says.Gul Mohammed Mansoori, 50, works for a goods transport company that operates through a platform and leaves drivers to fend for themselves when customers don't pay.""The platforms deduct a 12% commission on each trip but take no responsibility for non-payment of dues. Drivers are asked to pursue customers for payments. I earn around Rs 3,000 a week and occasionally Rs 5,000 - but that's not enough,"" he tells TOI.Mansoori makes Jaipuri quilts, especially during the lean season, to earn a few thousand extra rupees.Rajasthan's attempt to legislate protection was the first such initiative in the country, promising social and financial security for an estimated five lakh employees driving the state's Rs 25,000-crore gig economy.Enacted by the then Ashok Gehlot govt, it aimed to create a welfare board, establish a Rs 200-crore welfare fund, and impose a 2% cess on aggregators to provide health and accident insurance, pensions, provident fund, and school education for children of workers,The Bhajan Lal Sharma led-BJP govt announced an allocation of Rs 350 crore in this year's state Budget to the Gig and Unorganised Workers Development Fund, a Rs 100-crore increase over last year's outlay. It remains unclear when the corpus will be created, or how the benefits will reach the intended targets.Home minister Amit Shah's announcement of a cooperative framework for 50 lakh app-based drivers nationwide has rekindled a semblance of hope.The model, allowing registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws, and four-wheelers, aims for democratic management and equitable profit distribution among drivers.Under the umbrella of the National Campaign for Cooperatives in Platform and Transport Economy, gig workers are also in talks with the Union cooperatives ministry for a taxi cooperative called ""Sahkar Taxi"" that will enable drivers to operate as entrepreneurs without having to pay commissions to existing platform service-providers.NITI Aayog projects India's gig economy will grow to 2.35 crore workers by 2029-30. Gig unions, like the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), propose funding social security through taxes, cess, CSR, platform contributions, and more. IFAT's national general secretary, Shaik Salauddin, says home minister Shah's cooperative model must involve workers to avoid replicating exploitative practices. ""We need driver-led models that prioritise rights over profits. We are ready to collaborate for a true alternative.""Jaipur taxi driver Suresh Prajapati, 26, awaits the day workers like him don't have to depend on platforms. ""If driving is your only source of income, relying on Ola or Uber won't suffice. I make ends meet by building my base of personal customers. I have registered with the Centre's e-Shram portal in the hope that there will be some benefits someday.""","Rajasthan's pioneering 2023 Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers Act lies entangled in red tape.

We want freedom of expression, which has not been allowed under the Congress in the past.""The student also referred to the Anandpur Sahib resolution , which he claimed the Congress mis-characterized as a separatist manifesto. He criticized the party's failure to reconcile with the Sikh community and pointed to convicted former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar as evidence of lingering impunity, and said, ""Many more Sajjan Kumars are sitting in Congress party.""In response, Rahul admitted that Congress had committed many ""mistakes"" when he was not there, but added that he was more than happy to take responsibility for everything the party had ever done wrong.

Government: Waqf law rivals spreading falsehood

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court will decide on Monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, on the ground that its provisions interfered with the traditional and historic link of waqfs with Islam and violated Article 26 which guarantees freedom of religious affairs.A three-judge bench headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna , who is scheduled to retire on May 13, has limited time to take up final hearing of the matter as it would require hearing many lawyers from the petitioners' side and the Union govt, which as an interim response to the petitions has filed an over 1,300-page affidavit.The court had picked five lead petitions from the over 150 and named them as 'In Re: The Waqf Amendment Act' to restrict the number of advocates who could argue for the petitioners. Even then, the hearing on the necessity of interim order could be time consuming as every counsel on the petitioners side has so far promised to make a new point and sought an opportunity to argue.Defending the Act as a secular law, the Centre on Friday accused the petitioners of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including 'waqf by user', and said this provision was more than a century old. Ministry of minority affairs in a 1,332-page affidavit has requested the SC to fall back on the traditional assumption of validity of the law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law which is to stop misuse of the 2013 amendment which the govt says allowed encroachment of private and govt properties.The ministry requested the SC, which had flagged three issues in the 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Waqf Boards and determination of govt land - for an equitable approach by arguing that though challenge to the validity of Waqf Act, 1995, was pending for a long time, the court had never contemplated staying certain provisions of the 30-year-old law.""Till 2013, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" the ministry had said.","Supreme Court will decide on Monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.

Special session of Punjab House today to discuss water release to Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/special-session-of-punjab-house-today-to-discuss-water-release-to-haryana/articleshow/120880057.cms,"This is a representational image

Will safeguard state’s waters, says Punjab Cong; SAD petitions PM

Poll Should Punjab consider negotiations with Haryana to resolve the water-sharing issue? No, stand firm on water rights. Yes, dialogue is essential.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly will hold a special session Monday as the decades-old water-sharing dispute with Haryana reignited. The session follows Centre's directive for Punjab to release an additional 4,500 cusecs a day to Haryana from Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) reservoirs for eight days.The move, adding to the existing 4,000 cusecs a day already flowing to Haryana, has drawn resistance from Punjab, which contends it has no surplus water to spare. State officials said Haryana has already exceeded its quota and current flow was allowed only on humanitarian grounds.Punjab boycotted a BBMB partner states meeting Saturday, protesting the short notice and asserting it will not engage further until the assembly session concludes. According to Punjab, BBMB regulations require a seven-day notice for special meetings. Two previous meetings were also held with just a day’s notice.The row comes ahead of the annual BBMB water allocation cycle beginning May 21. The dispute escalated after Centre, represented by Union home secretary Govind Mohan, sided with Haryana’s demand despite Punjab’s objections. On April 30, both state officials attended a BBMB meeting where the board ordered the release of 8,500 cusecs to Haryana.Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann convened an all-party meeting Friday, followed by the assembly session call. All political parties in Punjab expressed solidarity, although BJP politicians said Haryana had received additional water in the past, suggesting the current crisis was avoidable.In a parallel move, Haryana held its own all-party meeting, with unanimous backing for its position. Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini claimed Punjab had agreed to the extra release, prompting Mann to call the statement “completely false and misleading” in a sharply worded letter, accusing BJP-led Union and Haryana govts of “bullying tactics against the people of Punjab”.Leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa said after a Congress legislature party meeting: “We are prepared. We will safeguard the state’s waters and interests,” adding the party would withhold its full strategy from the press. Despite a united front, Punjab’s political parties have a long record of trading blame over the state’s water disputes.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal appealed to PM Narendra Modi to intervene, criticising AAP govt in Punjab. “The current rulers of the state are playing with fire by openly promising to release water to Haryana and Rajasthan,” he said. “Our CM Bhagwant Mann’s belated posturing is like shutting the door after the horse has bolted.”Of SAD’s three MLAs in the 117-member assembly, only Ganieve Kaur Majithia remains aligned with the party. AAP holds 93 seats, Congress 16, BJ, BSP 1, with one independent and one seat vacant ahead of the Ludhiana West bypolls.","The session follows Centre's directive for Punjab to release an additional 4,500 cusecs a day to Haryana.

No, I have my doubts. Yes, absolutely!

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - the country's premier agriculture research organisation - has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice to boost yields by 20-30%, conserve water and reduce emission of methane - a potent greenhouse gas.Releasing the two genome-edited varieties - ' DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and ' Pusa DST Rice 1 ' - Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said these two climate-resilient and high yielding varieties would ensure a second green revolution in the country. He instructed ICAR officials to make these seeds available to farmers at the earliest.""Scientists are currently in the process of getting Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of these two varieties. Certified seeds will reach farmers for cultivation in minimum two years,"" said an official.Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, and creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties in about five million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy, save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water due short-duration maturity (20 days early), and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. ""Development of these two varieties using genome-editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of 'Viksit Bharat',"" said an ICAR statement.Genome-edited 'Kamala' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The other new variety - 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Recognizing the transformative potential of the new technology, ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties - 'Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)' and 'MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)' - to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed the two new genome-edited varieties 'Kamala' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1'.",The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR) has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice.

But behind the seemingly benign phrase lies a brutal form of bondage. Victims were forced to work long hours in return for nothing more than leftover food and a place to sleep, often among cattle. There were no wages, no basic rights, and no way out. Most of the men had been trafficked after being found wandering on highways or abandoned by truck drivers. Once in captivity,they were roped into a network of forced labour across agricultural fields, cattle sheds, brick kilns, roadside eateries, and homes.District collector Kishore Kumar Kanyal said 16 men have been shifted to care centres in Shivpuri, where they are receiving medical and psychological support. Their families are being located.","Police rescue 16 mentally challenged and destitute men held in modern-day slavery. 11 people arrested linked to widespread trafficking and bonded labour network.

Our CM (Mohan Majhi) will write to the Bengal government to stop branding Digha Jagannath temple as Jagannath Dham. This title is reserved for Puri, which is home to the main Jagannath temple,"" state law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said on Sunday.Mamata's TMC repudiated the objections. ""If they (BJP) question the establishment of a Hindu temple, this shows their desperation. On one hand, BJP claims to be a 'Hinduwadi' party, on the other, they are raising questions on the pratishtha (sanctity) of the (Digha) temple. If there is any question on the establishment, it should be asked by the four Shankaracharyas,"" TMC spokesperson Jay Prakash Majumdar said.Craftsmen from Puri temple have, however, dismissed claims that excess neem wood had been used to build the three idols of the Digha shrine. According to them, the surplus wood that had been stored after making the idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra during the 2015 Nabakalebara (creation of new idols) Rath Yatra, were too small, ranging between 3 and 10 inches, making them unsuitable for construction of the idols.Opposition BJD and Congress, meanwhile, have criticised BJP for allegedly failing to handle the situation. Senior Congress neta Niranjan Patnaik said it is a matter of grave concern as the issue involves emotional connect of 4.5 crore Odias to Lord Jagannath, the Jagannath Temple, and its culture. ""Odisha government must intervene to protect this heritage amid potential threats,"" Patnaik said.Former CM Naveen Patnaik's BJD criticised the state government's apparent lack of initiative in protecting Jagannath culture. ""Despite four days having passed since the Digha temple's inauguration on April 30, the state government has not officially raised the matter with West Bengal,"" senior BJD leader Prasanna Acharya said. BJP hit back, saying the state government has promptly intervened to address the issue. ""The opposition should refrain from politicising the Jagannath culture,"" law minister Harichandan said.","Odisha government to send letter to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to stop referring to the recently constructed Jagannath temple in Digha as ""Jagannath Dham"" The development coincided with claims by a senior servitor that he had helped make the idols for the DighA shrine using leftover wood from the Puri temple.

Poll Should all individuals involved in a gangrape be held equally responsible? No Yes

Common intention is essence of joint liability: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that it is not necessary for the prosecution to adduce clinching proof of complete act of rape by each one of the accused to convict all for gangrape, Supreme Court has reiterated that in cases of gangrape, even if one commits rape, all the other persons involved should be held responsible and be equally punished.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the FIR and his role was confined to helping the main accused.Rejecting the plea, the bench said, ""In a case of gangrape under Section 376(2)(g), an act by one is enough to render all in the gang for punishment as long as they have acted in furtherance of the common intention. Further, common intention is implicit in the charge of Section 376(2)(g) itself and all that is needed is evidence to show the existence of common intention.""Referring to earlier SC verdicts, the bench said in order to establish an offence under Section 376(2)(g) IPC, the prosecution must adduce evidence to indicate that more than one accused had acted in concert and in such an event, if rape had been committed by even one, all the accused would be guilty irrespective of the fact that the woman had been raped by one or more of them and it was not necessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence of a completed act of rape by each one of the accused.In other words, this provision embodies a principle of joint liability and the essence of that liability is the existence of common intention; that common intention presupposes prior concert which may be determined from the conduct of offenders revealed during the course of action and it could arise and be formed suddenly, but there must be meeting of minds and it is not enough to have the same intention independently of each of the offenders,"" it said.","Justices Sanjay Karol and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the FIR.

Poll Should universities implement programs to help students manage work-study balance? No Maybe Yes, definitely

Part-time work to instil confidence: Principal

(Names changed to protect identities)

HYDERABAD: They may soar as tech whizkids in the future. But now, a band of female students is having to plumb the depths - as janitors, cleaning toilets of their own engineering college in Andhra Pradesh 's Guntur.Cleaning toilets is one of the chores Vani (name changed) must complete before heading to class at 9am, with the other tasks being watering plants or helping in the college kitchen. Reason? These part-time gigs allow Vani to pay for the hostel at the engineering college - something her daily wager parents cannot afford. The 21-year-old is currently in her final year of BTech in AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning).Turns out Vani's college has about a dozen such girl students - pursuing different branches of engineering - who have taken up similar works to keep their dreams of a higher education alive.And they are only too glad to be able to do so. ""I know my family's financial situation. I don't feel there is anything wrong with taking up any work that can ease the burden on them,"" Vani told TOI, adding that she did not want to be a burden on her parents.A resident of Bellamvaripalem in Guntur, Vani's father makes Rs 700 to Rs 800 a day, and her mother another Rs 250 at best. She started working in the third year of BTech after her parents borrowed money to clear her hostel fee.Vani's hostel fees are Rs 37,500 per year. ""I did not want them (her parents) to borrow again. That's why I approached the management asking if I could get some work. I never hesitated to clean restrooms, as we are the ones using them. It felt like keeping our house clean,"" Vani added, pointing out that she either works in the early hours before going to college or in the evening after returning from classes.Her batchmate Sravya has a similar routine. ""One week we work during the morning and the next week during the evenings. It takes around two to three hours to complete our work. Right from cleaning rooms, restrooms, and gardening, we take care of all work along with other staff,"" said the final-year AI student.Along with these tasks, this group also doubles as caretakers, waking up other students on time for study sessions and serving food, among other duties.Though these students admit to run-ins with seniors who question their authority at times (when they ask them to go for classes or turn off lights) they say it's a small price to pay for the returns.""My family was already in a Rs 3 lakh debt. So, I knew I had to do these jobs to stay afloat. Whenever I faced some resistance, I used to seek the help of authorities,"" said Aarti a first-year engineering student from Kurnool. Raised by a single mother, she said the family was willing to take any help that came their way, as seven siblings are completely dependent on their mother since their father passed away when she was in class 9.The principal of the college revealed that students were being encouraged to take up part-time work to instil confidence in them that they can take care of themselves. ""About 200 students come forward every year to do part-time work, but we consider only 8 to 10 of them who are serious. These are the ones who are generally in need and have a powerful mindset,"" the principal said.",Band of BTech students in Andhra forced to double up as janitors to pay for studies.

NEW DELHI: NEET-UG 2025 has recorded its lowest attendance since 2021, with National Testing Agency attributing this to stringent checks implemented from the registration phase to the conduct of exam to eliminate ""bogus"" candidates. The number of candidates who registered for the 2025 entrance exam for medical and allied UG courses also declined from the previous year.On Sunday, around 20.8 lakh candidates appeared for the test out of the 22.7 lakh who registered, recording an attendance of 91.4%, according to the agency, which said this could increase slightly as data from remote locations are yet to arrive.In 2024, 97.9% of the 24 lakh candidates who had registered for the exam appeared for it (the highest attendance ever for NEET-UG). The attendance was 97.6% in 2023, when for the first-time registration crossed the 20-lakh mark; in 2022, 94.2% of the 18.7 lakh registered candidates took the test; and in 2021, 95.6% of the 16.1 lakh registered candidates appeared for the exam.The test was held amid unprecedented security arrangements on Sunday, a day after drills were conducted at all centres to test operational readiness - including mobile signal jammers, availability of adequate frisking personnel and biometric authentication - as well as systems for multi-level monitoring and police escorts for transporting question papers from banks to the centres. State-wise, UP had the highest number of candidates (over 3.3 lakh), followed by Maharashtra (over 2.4 lakh) and Rajasthan (over 2 lakh). Over 51,000 candidates appeared from J&K, and among the northeastern states, Assam had more than 45,000 candidates and Manipur 10,198 candidates.This time, NTA set up 5,453 exam centres - more than last year - and priority was given to universities, colleges and govt or govt-aided schools. Senior officials from the local administrations also visited these centres.""In a significant step towards reinforcing examination integrity, NTA adopted a 'whole-of-govt' integrated monitoring approach.

The control room monitored all exam-related activities at the ground level.District administrations also conducted periodic reviews of security arrangements, including secure transportation of question papers, logistics management, and deployment of police personnel at the centres, the official said.Based on reports received through a special online portal, NTA has also taken action against multiple Telegram and Instagram channels spreading false information and misleading students.According to a senior NTA official, over 2,300 suspicious claims have been received so far, most linked to Telegram channels promoting false paper leak narratives. These cases have been escalated to the home ministry's Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) .","20.8 lakh candidates appeared for the test out of the 22.7 lakh who registered, recording an attendance of 91.4%.

Congress leaders are reprehensible, repeat offenders who are repeatedly dishonourably trying to lower the morale and resolve of our armed forces. But the Congress party's sinister ploy will not be successful..."" Kesavan said.","Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Rai criticised the central govt's ""big talk and no action"" against perpetrators of the Pahalgam terror attack. Rai said that they purchased Rafale fighter jets, but those are lying in hangars with ""nimbu mirchi"" (lemons and chillies) hanging on them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120880648,imgsize-1098086,width-400,resizemode-4/This-is-a-representational-image.jpg"
More students balancing books & business now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-students-balancing-books-business-now/articleshow/120880108.cms,"BENGALURU: Bibek Karmakar, an undergraduate student of filmmaking and visual media, started editing videos and making thumbnails as a hobby when he was 18. Today, he juggles college and freelance work.""It gets insanely hectic, but it's worth it in the end because I have the opportunity to be independent and not completely rely on my family for finances,"" said Bibek, who earns between Rs 3,000 and Rs 40,000 a month from his part-time work .Nowadays, college students are eager to gain professional experience before graduating. Though internships are a part of educational courses in most colleges, a growing number of students are taking a step further through freelancing gigs and remote internships outside of course requirements. This isn't just to earn extra income, but to build a network, gain professional clarity, and enhance their skills.MD Shakaib Shoaib, 19, an undergraduate student of media and journalism at Christ (deemed-to-be) University, has taken on freelance writing and search engine optimisation projects. He achieves a balance between college and freelance work through careful planning. ""The best part about freelancing is that I get to decide when I want to work. Usually, I dedicate an hour every day to my work, and if I have multiple assignments, then I don't take up many projects,"" Shakaib said.However, acknowledging its challenges, he said, ""Because someone is paying you for it, you may become overwhelmed by the deadline and have to put it above everything else. There were times I was forced to prioritise my work over everything else, even though I didn't want to.""For Aparna Vats, a UG student of media and journalism at Christ, internships were a turning point. She studies while working part-time with Gujarat Judicial Reforms Council as a content writer. She has previously explored fields such as public relations, event management, social media, marketing, legal aid and social work. ""Internships help me build a network, work ethic, and purpose beyond academics. It helped me realise what I wanted to be in future,"" she said.Priyanka Dutta, a professor at Mount Carmel College, said: ""For courses that demand a significant amount of time on campus, it becomes very difficult for students to take up freelance work. However, students in more theory-based courses, who don't have such heavy practical requirements, are able to find time.""According to TeamLease Digital, an employment agency, internship opportunities increased by 25% over the past year. Remote internships constitute about 49% of all offerings, significantly increasing access for students in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. ""Students can take up internships from wherever they are instead of moving across cities, creating more opportunities for everyone,"" said Neeti Sharma, president and co-founder of TeamLease EdTech Ltd. ""Organisations benefit too, gaining fresh perspectives and digital skills from students, and having the opportunity to assess potential hires,"" she added. She also mentioned that govt initiatives like the Prime Minister's Internship Scheme encourage more companies to offer structured internships.- Tanushri Menon","College students are eager to gain professional experience before graduating.

Rishabh Pant's dismal Indian Premier League (IPL) season continued as the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) captain scored a 17-ball 18 against Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday.LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka couldn’t hide his disappointment after Rishabh Pant’s failure and looked visibly upset.Pant stepped down the track, made room, and threw the kitchen sink at it, but by doing so, he lost his shape. The bat flew off his hand and landed near the square leg umpire, while the ball flew towards the deep point region, where Shashank Singh took a comfortable catch. Azmatullah Omarzai got the wicket for Punjab.Pant has endured a disappointing run with the bat, registering six single-digit scores for a total of 128 runs in 11 matches with a below-par strike rate of 99.22. His only noteworthy knock this season has been a 63 against Chennai Super Kings. Of the 70 batters who have faced at least 60 balls this season, only Pant has a sub-100 strike rate.Earlier, Punjab Kings produced a superlative batting display, led by Prabhsimran Singh, to post 236 for five against LSG in their crucial IPL match.Sent in to bat, Prabhsimran smashed a 48-ball 91 and shared a 78-run stand with skipper Shreyas Iyer (45) to lay the foundation before Nehal Wadhera (16), Shashank Singh (33), and Marcus Stoinis (15) chipped in to take PBKS to the imposing total.For LSG, Akash Maharaj Singh (2/30) and Digvesh Singh Rathi (2/46) took two wickets each, while Price Yadav (1/43) accounted for a wicket. Mayank Yadav, in fact, conceded 60 runs in his four overs, without taking a wicket.The LSG batting unit, which has performed well below par after the first stage of the tournament, will need to bat out of their skins to chase down the target. But at the end of 10 overs, LSG were reeling at 74 for 5.","LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka couldn’t hide his disappointment after Rishabh Pant’s failure.

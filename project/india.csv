His visit has materialised exactly a week after the ruling DMK conducted its crucial general council meeting here and passing resolutions condemning the Centre.It also comes in the backdrop of a wrangle for leadership among the father-son duo in the PMK, BJP's ally, and amidst a resentment expressed by DMDK, an ally of the opposition AIADMK with whom Shah cobbled up an alliance during his April 10 visit to Chennai, over not allotting a Rajya Sabha seat to it (DMDK) as promised by the AIADMK in 2024.Further, former chief minister and ousted AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam had recently regretted that Shah had not called on him during the Chennai visit. His position like that of TTV Dhinakaran, though heading a fringe party, is still unclear about their support to the BJP's NDA.A senior leader in the BJP claimed that the disarray in the NDA camp and fissures in the PMK would not mar the poll prospects of the NDA in the state.""The differences will be sorted out soon and we will face the election as a strong force to defeat the DMK,"" state vice president M Chakravarthy said.Interestingly, Shah's visit to the state is the second one after the state chief K Annamalai was replaced by Nainar Nagenthiran, who hails from the southern district of Tirunelveli, close to Madurai.

‘Whole world now knows the truth’: Shashi Tharoor-led delegation wraps up US visit; urges global terror fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whole-world-knows-the-truth-shashi-tharoor-led-delegation-wraps-up-us-visit-urges-global-terror-fight/articleshow/121713233.cms,"FULL: Tharoor Goes Merciless On U.S. Ally | 'You Misunderstood... Pak Attacked India' | Watch

NEW DELHI: The multi-party parliamentary delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on late Sunday concluded its high-level visit to the United States, wrapping up the final leg of a diplomatic mission aimed at building international consensus on India’s counter-terrorism stance following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.Taking to X as he wrapped up the US visit, Tharoor wrote: “If you are born a hundred times, you will do it a hundred times. I will love my country with all my heart… A Watan. The whole world now knows the truth. We are lovers of non-violence, but only until someone tests that... Jai Hind!”On the final day of the tour, the delegation paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Washington. Tharoor later posted on X: “It is striking how many world capitals are adorned with statues or busts of the Mahatma, the 20th century’s greatest apostle of peace, nonviolence, and human freedom.”The group, which arrived in Washington on June 3 after stops in Guyana, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil, met with several key American leaders including US Vice President JD Vance, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, senior members of Congress, policy experts, and members of the Indian-American community.Describing the meeting with Vance as “an excellent meeting,” Tharoor said the Vice President was “warm and welcoming and receptive,” and “expressed complete understanding, first of all, outrage of what happened in Pahalgam and support and respect for India’s restrained response in Operation Sindoor.”A US State Department spokesperson said Landau “reaffirmed the United States’ strong support of India in the fight against terrorism and the strategic partnership between the two countries.”Addressing the Centre on Foreign Relations, Tharoor had said India’s actions were targeted at terror infrastructure, not civilians. “We're not interested in attacking Pakistani civilians, ordinary people. This is about India versus terrorism… If you're not prepared to shut down the safe havens or arrest terrorist leaders, then I'm afraid this is the only way we can deal with it,” he said.Referring to Pakistan’s military, he added, “In India, the state has an army. In Pakistan, the army has a state,” accusing Islamabad of manipulating public opinion through conflict. Tharoor dismissed claims of Pakistani success during the brief hostilities that followed, saying, “Two videos came out on social media, both turned out to be from other conflicts in other years, nothing to do with this one.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wraps up high-level visit to the United States.

BJP Blasts Cong For Bengaluru Stampede, CM Siddaramaiah Gives 'Kumbh' Reference | RCB | Karnataka

MYSURU/BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB's IPL win celebrations on June 4, saying he had okayed only the state-organised event at Vidhana Soudha where nothing untoward happened.Blaming suspended police commissioner B Dayananda, he said he was informed about the stampede at 5.45pm, almost two hours after it occurred.The CM's statements came as opposition BJP demanded a three-day special legislative session to discuss the stampede. The party also plans to meet governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and President Droupadi Murmu to seek dismissal of the Congress-led govt.Talking to reporters in Mysuru, Siddaramaiah pushed back, saying, ""Govt has done nothing wrong. Where did it happen? At the stadium. Did anything untoward happen at Vidhana Soudha? All those responsible have been suspended or taken into custody."" Four people, including an RCB top executive, have been arrested so far.The CM denied any embarrassment to his govt, though he admitted being pained. ""Such a tragedy has never occurred on my watch,"" he said, blaming RCB, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and Bengaluru police for mismanaging crowd control and communication.Siddaramaiah said he was informed of the stampede only at 5.45pm. Crowds had begun to gather at Vidhana Soudha and the stadium through the afternoon and a stampede broke out . The CM said the deaths were reported at the hospital at 3.50pm. ""I'm the head of govt. Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda should have informed me during the Vidhana Soudha celebrations. He didn't.""

He defended senior bureaucrats, saying chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh approved the event after police assured adequate security. The CM insisted KSCA led the Vidhana Soudha event and formally invited him. ""They told me even governor Gehlot was attending. I wasn't invited to the stadium,"" he said.BJP accused govt of ignoring security warnings and breaching norms. R Ashoka and Chaluvadi Narayanswamy - BJP's leader of opposition in the assembly and legislative council, respectively - said the party would formally write to Siddaramaiah, assembly speaker UT Khader, and council chairman Basavaraj Horatti to demand the session.Ashoka cited letters from Vidhana Soudha DCP MN Karibasavana Gowda and PWD officials warning against hosting a large crowd at the assembly complex. ""The DCP asked for CCTV cameras and an anti-drone system. None were installed,"" the BJP functionary said. He said the PWD limited the stage to 60x20ft with 25 seats, but over 200 people were present, including the CM's grandson.Ashoka said 95 BJP MLAs, including Horatti, would donate a month's salary each to compensate the 11 victims' families.",Chief minister Siddaramaiah sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB's IPL win celebrations on June 4.

Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu pitches financial incentives to have more kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-cm-n-chandrababu-naidu-pitches-financial-incentives-to-have-more-kids/articleshow/121713034.cms,"With current fertility rate, Andhra will face serious problems: CM

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh, which once amended its laws to bar people with more than two kids from contesting panchayat and municipal elections, now plans to incentivise having larger families as part of a strategy to combat dropping fertility rates and shift focus to what chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu terms “investment in human capital”. “I am looking at giving financial incentives by taking a family as a unit. The bigger families may get higher incentives,” Naidu told TOI ahead of completing a year in office on June 12.“As part of the ‘Zero Poverty ’ initiative, I have already rolled out an interesting model in which wealthier people will adopt poor families. This will not only bridge income disparities, but also ensure welfare of the entire family,” he said.The four-time CM, who has been an advocate of population management, said the current demographics in the southern states require govts to revisit their strategies.Fertility rates in Andhra Pradesh need to increase. At the present rate, AP will face serious problems… That is why I am thinking of bigger families,” CM N Chandrababu Naidu said. He announced recently that female employees could avail of maternity leave any number of times.“It was limited to two times only. We have removed the restrictions,” he said.The state govt also made it mandatory for every organisation to provide childcare centres at workplaces. Naidu announced financial assistance of Rs 15,000 for every schoolchild. “We give this money directly to the mothers of students. Apart from this, the NDA govt in AP is planning to announce financial assistance to couples for having more kids.” The two-child policy previously applicable to prospective candidates for panchayat and municipal polls has been reversed.In 2023, Sikkim announced incentives for indigenous people to have more children. Mizoram, too, has been encouraging tribal couples to have more than two kids. Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said recently that with the Centre pushing for population-based delimitation of constituencies, there was a need for people in the state to have more children.","Andhra Pradesh once amended its laws to bar people with more than two kids from contesting panchayat and municipal elections.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody.

India's balancing act

What's the road ahead?

As US President Donald Trump publicly lashes out at Vladimir Putin for dragging out the Ukraine war, Moscow is quietly retooling its Asia strategy putting India front and centre in hopes of countering growing Western influence. While Trump’s frustration with Putin mounts, the Kremlin has ramped up arms deals and diplomatic outreach to New Delhi, aiming to revive the once-promising Russia-India-China (RIC) troika as a foil to the Quad.Trump’s irritation with Putin has grown as the Kremlin delays a ceasefire. While Kyiv reportedly accepted Trump's earlier 30-day truce proposal, Russia refused, insisting on terms that would force Ukraine to surrender territory not even under Russian control. Trump has since offered to host peace talks, but Moscow’s demands, including US recognition of Crimea, have drawn accusations from experts like former ambassador Michael McFaul, who called them “poison pills” meant to derail diplomacy.This has forced Putin to rekindle old alliances as a means to ‘fight, fight, fight’ against the US influence. From arms deals to trilateral summits, Russia is intensifying efforts to woo New Delhi, hoping to revive the Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue as a counterweight to Western influence.The situation became more tricky for New Delhi when US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick delivered a forthright assessment of recent tensions in the India-US relationship, pointing to certain Indian policies that “rubbed the US the wrong way.” These include New Delhi’s continued purchase of military equipment from Russia and its participation in the BRICS grouping, which Lutnick characterised as an attempt to “not support the dollar and dollar hegemony. ”“That’s not really the way to make friends and influence people in America,” Lutnick said, noting that President Trump “calls that out directly,” and the Indian government is now “addressing it specifically.”Despite such differences, Lutnick struck an optimistic tone, calling India’s economy “extraordinary” and praising its “amazing” human capital and growth. He said both countries are working towards a trade agreement and that “you should expect a deal...in the not too distant future.”Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking in Perm on Friday, revealed new efforts to woo India. He claimed Moscow was told India joined the Quad alliance, which includes the US, Australia and Japan, purely for economic cooperation. But Lavrov warned that the alliance is being militarised behind the scenes.“In practice, other countries from the Quad are already trying, already insisting on organising naval and other military exercises,” Lavrov said. “And I’m sure that our Indian friends can see this provocation clearly,” he said.Also read: 'US, other Quad countries trying to force India into military alliance rather than just trade,' claims Russia Lavrov’s remarks came a day before US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s announcement that the US is deepening its military relationship with India. Hegseth cited joint exercises like Tiger Triumph and Towson Sabre as evidence of growing strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific. He also pointed to the Indo-Pacific Logistics Network and the PIPER initiative as efforts to integrate the region’s defence infrastructure.“Rookies talk strategy, pros talk logistics,” Hegseth said, signalling the US goal of building a sustained and interconnected defence presence in Asia. He emphasised that Trump’s foreign policy was “grounded in common sense and national interest” and stressed that a resilient alliance of like-minded democracies remains America’s greatest strength against Chinese ambitions.But for Russia, these moves are part of what Lavrov describes as a Western ploy to “divide and conquer,” a phrase he says President Putin himself recently used. Lavrov warned that the rebranding of the Asia-Pacific into the “Indo-Pacific” was designed to isolate China and undermine ASEAN.Perhaps the most significant signal from Lavrov was Russia’s renewed push for the revival of the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral dialogue. The forum, originally proposed by former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, has met over 20 times and served as a platform for cooperation in trade, finance, and foreign policy.“Now that… an understanding has been reached between India and China on how to calm the situation on the border, it seems to me that the time has come to revive this RIC troika,” Lavrov said. He framed the grouping as a valuable mechanism that could balance out the influence of Western-led coalitions like the Quad.However, India’s position remains complex. For years, India has enjoyed a privileged status as one of Russia’s largest arms importers. Moscow provided India with cutting-edge weaponry, sometimes even before it was deployed in the Russian military itself.From India’s strategic viewpoint, the RIC format carries other risks. Beijing continues to occupy a key position in South Asia’s strategic balance, primarily through its deepening alliance with Islamabad. India remains concerned that any trilateral cooperation would be undermined unless China reconsiders its longstanding military and nuclear support for Pakistan.Moreover, the RIC format’s perceived anti-American leanings are another sticking point. With Indo-US relations having deepened under both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump, especially on defence and technology cooperation, New Delhi may find it increasingly difficult to align with Russia and China in ways that could appear contrary to its current trajectory.Professor Rajan Kumar, from the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University while speaking with the, said that Russia’s push for a revived RIC format may be “wishful thinking by Russia, and it flies away in context of the real world and the current geo-political landscape.”He agreed, however, with Foreign Minister Lavrov’s warning that the West seeks to “divide and conquer” the India–China relationship.On whether the RIC would serve as a platform for direct mediation with China, Professor Kumar noted that “though India and China are members of several international organisations, like the BRICS and SCO, a direct mediation with China is not possible. Particularly after the Ladakh incident in 2020, after which New Delhi’s trust with Beijing has disappeared.”Asked whether India must align with either the US or Russia, he warned that “given the current policies of the Trump administration, India cannot depend on the United States. As a consequence of the US president’s policy the world has moved towards protectionism, and in the context of defence production this has ruled out the possibility of joint production of weapons.”He further noted India’s longstanding tradition of strategic autonomy, adding, “India has always maintained the policy of strategic autonomy, and it doesn’t have the policy of involving other countries in its policy of China, and India sees China as a rival country. I believe in the coming time the tensions between New Delhi and Beijing are likely to escalate.”On whether Russia taking military equipment from China during its war with Ukraine would have impact on India’s defence dealings with Russia, Professor Kumar observed: “Yes, we do have a certain degree of dependence on Russian defence equipment, as was recently seen in the India-Pakistan war, with the successful use of S-400 on the defensive front and the BrahMos missile on the offensive. But yes, we are also trying to diversify our defence, with deals from Israel and France. ”Professor Rajan welcomed India’s efforts to boost indigenous defence production, noting that “one good thing is that India has also ramped up its own defence production and is moving towards becoming a major defence exporter; however, when compared to other countries its defence dealings are still minuscule.”Speaking on how India’s close ties with Russia can be leveraged to question China’s support for Pakistan, he explained that “India has repeatedly voiced concerns about both China and Pakistan, especially regarding Islamabad’s support for terrorist groups. Yet, India cannot dictate Russian foreign policy, as Moscow is grappling with its own geopolitical constraints. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has faced isolation and sanctions from the West, compelling it to deepen ties elsewhere. India, while strengthening ties with Western democracies, notably refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia and has abstained from UN resolutions condemning Moscow. This stance reflects India’s effort to balance relations rather than fully aligning with Western positions. Concurrently, India participates in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) alongside the US, Australia, and Japan, a grouping often viewed as a strategic counterweight to China’s influence.”India is poised to maintain its careful balancing act. In practice, New Delhi will likely deepen its defence ties with the US expanding logistics cooperation and joint exercises while continuing to source critical systems from Russia wherever gaps remain in its domestic industry.At the same time, India’s focus on ramping up indigenous production and forging new partnerships with France and Israel suggests that Moscow’s overtures, though acknowledged, will be weighed against broader economic and strategic interests. Whatever shape RIC might take, New Delhi’s core priority will remain safeguarding its own strategic autonomy managing great-power competition without becoming dependent on any single capital.","Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov revealed new efforts to woo India.

'DAPR secretary gave permission for Vidhan Soudha event': Siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday defended the decision to go ahead with the event to felicitate the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) players, despite a stampede outside the team's home ground, the Chinnaswamy Stadium.On Wednesday, a ceremony was held at the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha to felicitate RCB on clinching the Indian Premier League (IPL) title, the franchise's first since the league began in April 2008. A celebration was also held at the nearby Chinnaswamy Stadium, where a large number of fans thronged.This led to a stampede outside the ground, in which 11 people died and 56 were injured.""Actually at 3:50 pm, deaths were reported at the hospital. I got to know only at 5:45 pm. Until then, I did not know about the stampede and deaths,"" news agency PTI quoted Siddaramaiah as saying. He was speaking to reporters during a visit to Mysuru.The chief minister also clarified that the ceremony at the Vidhana Soudha was by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and that he attended the programme only as an invitee.""The KSCA secretary and treasurer met and invited me. It was not organised by us (state government).They (KSCA) had, and I was invited. They told me that the governor would also come. So, I had gone. Other than that, I don't know anything. The government has nothing to do...I was not invited to the stadium event,"" the Congress leader said.""Nothing untoward happened at the Vidhana Soudha. The stampede incident happened at the stadium later,"" he added.Siddaramaiah's remarks come even as a letter by DCP (Vidhana Soudha security) to the secretary to the Karnataka government's Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), surfaced . The letter warned against organising the function hastily, and highlighted that the force did not have an adequate number of personnel to provide security for a ceremony where a large number of people would gather, at short notice.This in response to the DPAR seeking the DCP's opinion on holding the felicitation event on the grand stairs of the Vidhana Soudha to honour the RCB players.""RCB has a fan following across the country. Organising the event in a hurry on the grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha will lead to lakhs of cricket fans arriving there. This will lead to problems in 'bandobast' (arrangement) since there is a shortage of officers/personnel,"" the DCP's letter read.The officer further said if the function is organised, passes for visitors to Vidhana Soudha should be completely stopped.Also, as there were chances of the secretariat staff getting their family members for the event, he suggested an order aimed at ensuring this doesn't happen. The officer also sought a holiday in the afternoon for secretariat staff to ensure that they too don't come there.The DCP also called for installation of more CCTV cameras in the vicinity of Vidhana Soudha - which is a vital installation - and nearby places in view of the large gatherings expected.Siddaramaiah was asked by reporters about the letter.He replied, ""What does the letter say? The police will act according to what the government decides. It did not come to me at all. DAPR secretary has given the permission. Of course I was told. I said give permission to the event in front of Vidhana Soudha.""","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defends decision to go ahead with event.

NEW DELHI: Since Operation Sindoor , Pakistan has been living with fantasies and pushing hard to make the world believe that it won during the conflict against India. With the use of doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns, Islamabad has been claiming that it hit Indian airfields and installations.After the Operation Sindoor, Pakistan portrayed that it hit a Sukhoi-30MKI parked at Adampur air base in Punjab and destroyed an S-400 surface-to-air missile unit at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. However, these assertions have been systematically dismantled by independent satellite imagery analyst Damien Symon, who has been closely examining these claims over the past month.One of the most prominent claims involved a strike on a Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet at Punjab's Adampur airbase. The image shared to support this showed a fighter near what was presented as a burn mark.But top imagery analyst Damien Symon revealed the truth: the image pre-dated the conflict, the aircraft was a MiG-29 under routine maintenance, and the so-called damage was engine soot buildup from testing, not a missile hit.Another image claimed Pakistan had taken out an S-400 radar system at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. A closer look showed dark patches on the ground, supposedly impact marks, which turned out to be oil stains in a vehicle maintenance yard.Worse, the image was captured well before hostilities began.A separate claim involved alleged missile damage to the S-400 battery at Adampur. This time, the satellite image was digitally edited, with black dots added to mimic bomb craters. Comparison with current, unedited satellite images showed no such marks at the site.In one of the most absurd claims, Pakistan used an image of Naliya airbase to suggest a bombing raid had darkened the soil. Symon's analysis showed the ""damage"" was actually just a passing cloud casting a shadow on the runway.A blurry, low-quality image of Srinagar airport's civilian apron was circulated as proof of a Pakistani strike. But high-resolution satellite photos from multiple dates showed no damage whatsoever. The image was either misread or intentionally tampered with.Adding an international twist, Pakistan also released imagery from a Chinese satellite company to ""prove"" another hit on Adampur. The supposed ""damage"" turned out to be a mark that had existed for months, visible in older satellite captures as well.In yet another instance, visuals claiming to show bomb damage at Jammu airport were widely shared. The ""blackened spots"" near the runway were proven false after high-resolution post-strike satellite photos showed a completely intact airbase. The original image had been digitally altered.Across all claims, Pakistan has failed to demonstrate any actual damage to Indian airbases or assets in the wake of its attempted retaliation. In contrast, Indian airstrikes on Pakistani military sites, particularly Jacobabad and Bholari, have been more successful.""Recent imagery from Bholari Airbase, Pakistan indicates that the hangar damaged in the Indian airstrike is now covered with tarpaulin possibly signaling repair activity/restoration is now underway,"" Damien Symon wrote in a post on X.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Adampur airbase shortly after Operation Sindoor only reinforced the absence of any significant damage on Indian soil, a direct counter to the Pakistani narrative.","Pakistan has been using doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns.

"India Proverty Rate: Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"Poll Do you believe that the updated international poverty line will help in addressing poverty more effectively? Yes, it will provide a clearer picture. No, it will complicate measures.

NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade. The World Bank has updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period.

It was neatly stashed inside the washing machine, ready for dispatch,"" he said.Following a month-long surveillance operation in Goa, TGANB --- assisted by Goa police --- zeroed in on hawala transactions being conducted from Sangeetha Mobile Shop in Mapusa and an apartment in Goa's Highland Park.The key accused, Uttam Singh, who runs the mobile shop, was arrested. Investigators revealed he had laundered Rs 2.1 crore of drug proceeds in just one week.""Drug money collected in cash was handed over to Uttam, often by foreign nationals. He then moved the funds to Mumbai through informal channels, and from there, it was transferred to Nigeria,"" Shandilya explained. The investigation into the hawala trail started after Nigerian national Emmanuel Bediako, alias Maxwell, revealed it to TGANB.Between May 26 and June 1, officials tracked 58 hawala transactions involving Rs 2.1 crore. A few days after establishing this link, a raid on Highland Park apartment led to the recovery of Rs 50 lakh in cash. Over the past month, four Nigerian nationals have been arrested during TGANB operations in Goa.Authorities believe Uttam is one of several hawala operators facilitating cross-border drug money transfers. Police officials suspect a wider network of hawala operators is active, working hand-in-glove with international narcotics cartels.","Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat.

"Supreme Court orders ex-husband to transfer house, pay Rs 50,000 monthly alimony to divorced wife, with biennial hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-orders-ex-husband-to-transfer-house-pay-rs-50000-monthly-alimony-to-divorced-wife-with-biennial-hike/articleshow/121708288.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling that could influence future maintenance disputes, the Supreme Court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife Rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years. The top court also upheld an earlier order requiring him to clear the home loan and transfer the property to his former spouse.The Court noted that the revised amount better reflects the standard of living she enjoyed during her marriage to her former husband, a hotel management professional.The woman, who has remained unmarried and financially dependent since the divorce, was earlier receiving Rs 20,000 per month as alimony, an amount originally granted as interim maintenance. She approached the apex court seeking a revision, arguing that her former husband was now earning substantially more than he was during their separation.A bench led by Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta observed that the woman is entitled to maintain a standard of living consistent with what she had during the marriage. “The quantum of permanent alimony fixed by the High Court requires revision,” the court said, pointing to the man’s career trajectory and income history, which once reflected earnings of over Rs 21 lakh per year.“The wife, who has remained unmarried and is living independently, is entitled to a level of maintenance that reasonably secures her future”, the judgment further said.The man had argued that his current income was lower, that he had since remarried, and had additional responsibilities, including caring for elderly parents. However, the court was not convinced, stating that past and potential earning capacity must be considered in maintenance cases. It also warned against attempts to suppress income to reduce alimony obligations.The court agreed that the couple’s adult son, now 26, is no longer entitled to regular maintenance. ""It is open to the husband to voluntarily assist him with educational or other reasonable expenses,"" the judgment said.However, it clarified that his inheritance rights remain intact and he can pursue any claims under the law.The ruling brings to a close a legal battle that began in 2008, when the man filed for divorce. A trial court initially dismissed the claim, but the High Court granted divorce in 2019, citing cruelty and an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.Legal experts say the ruling strengthens the rights of women seeking dignified maintenance after divorce. Neelam Singh, Advocate-on-Record at Lucknow High Court, was quoted by ET and called it “a benchmark that reinforces the court’s role as a guardian of justice,” while Magnus Legal Services' Nikita Anand added that “maintenance is not charity but a right... calibrated to genuine financial realities.”The Apex Court clarified that income suppression tactics will not help those trying to evade maintenance. The husband’s current earnings were evaluated alongside his career history, revealing a clear ability to meet the revised obligation.","The Supreme Court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife Rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years.

NEW DELHI: Protests continued across Manipur on Sunday following the arrest of leaders from the Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol.

Centre plans stricter law against counterfeit farm inputs including pesticides and seeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-stricter-law-against-counterfeit-farm-inputs-including-pesticides-and-seeds/articleshow/121709592.cms,"Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan at the ICAR, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: The Centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He was speaking to farmers at the ICAR – Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus on Sunday as part of the ongoing ‘Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan’. This initiative aims to connect scientists with farmers under the Centre’s ‘lab to land’ programme. It was his first visit to South India during the campaign, which began on May 29.“Those who are involved in selling fake seeds and pesticides will be severely punished,” said Chouhan, referring to several complaints by farmers in many states.The farmers’ concerns were highlighted in a 2015 study by Ficci, which revealed the loss of over 10 million tonnes of food production due to the use of spurious pesticides that year. It also showed that the value of fake pesticides was growing at 20% per year, with states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, and Karnataka being among the worst affected.Although the sale of fake or substandard seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers is a punishable offence under existing laws, the absence of proper monitoring and accountability does not yield the desired results on the ground.The new law is expected to address these enforcement gaps.During his speech, Chouhan also promised to introduce a scheme to reduce farmers’ transportation costs for tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. This would ensure they receive a fair price for their produce without losing money to middlemen who take a significant cut in delivering the farm produce to the desired destination.Under the scheme, the Centre will collaborate with states to bear the transport costs, involving agencies that procure from farmers and deliver the produce to markets in other states.The minister’s farm visits to rural areas near Bengaluru on Sunday were part of the fortnight-long campaign to connect with farmers and gather first-hand information on their day-to-day farm-related problems.“The central govt will collaborate with states, Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), farmers, and scientists to draw a comprehensive roadmap to improve farming operations and achieve the goal of developing India as the world’s food basket,” said Chouhan while addressing the gathering of farmers and farm scientists. He stated that the ‘Abhiyan’ envisions “One Nation, One Agriculture, One Team” to work for the farmers’ interests.In Karnataka, more than 70 interdisciplinary teams comprising scientists and officials from agriculture and allied departments have been visiting farms daily since May 29. These teams are recording feedback directly from farmers to shape need-based, problem-oriented agricultural research programmes.","The Centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

NEW DELHI: Philippines has joined the increasing ranks of countries that have become visa-free for Indian tourists from Sunday. Post-Covid, several places have gone either visa-free or visa-on-arrival to attract the high-spending desi tourists. These include Thailand, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka (free electronic visa), Seychelles, Maldives, Philippines, Indonesia (visa on arrival) and Hong Kong (online pre-clearance required), according to Travel Agents Federation of India VP Anil Kalsi.“Indian nationals may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible and non-convertible period of 14 days for tourism purposes, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, confirmed hotel accommodation/ booking, proof of financial capacity, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” according to the website of the embassy of the Philippines in New Delhi. The reason for this change is also stated clearly: “enhancing tourism arrivals from India.”“Indian nationals holding valid and current American, Japanese, Australian, Canadian, Schengen, Singapore or United Kingdom (AJACSSUK) visas or residence permits may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible period of 30 days for tourism, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” it adds.These updated visa-free privileges for Indian nationals can be availed of at any Philippine port of entry, and are not convertible to a visa-based stay or other admission status categories. Indian nationals must also not have any derogatory record with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in order to be admitted into the country without a visa.“Indian nationals transiting in the Philippines or entering the country for long-term visits and non-tourism activities are required to apply for an appropriate Philippine visa at a Philippine Embassy or Consulate in their country or origin, place of legal residence, or any country that requires entry visas for Indian nationals. Indian nationals who are eligible for e-Visas may also apply through the official Philippine e-Visa website evisa.gov.ph . The DFA reminds that e-Visas may not be extended or converted to other visa-based stay or other admission status categories,” the embassy says.India has seen a spurt in outbound travel post-Covid by its nationals, while foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) to the country are yet to return to 2019 levels. In 2024, India is provisionally estimated to have received about 97 lakh FTAs, about 1.4% more than the previous year. India had crossed the 1-crore FTA mark for the first time in 2017 and had peaked at 1.1 crore in 2019.On the other hand, more Indians are travelling to foreign shores than they did in pre-Covid times. Barring the West, other countries — especially in Southeast Asia — are going all out to woo the high-spending desi globetrotters by majorly simplifying visas to boost their economies.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders of the principal opposition party on Sunday targeted the BJP-led central government, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi , as fresh violence erupted in Manipur , this time over the arrest of a key leader of the Meitei community.Gandhi alleged that PM Modi has ""abdicated"" his responsibility towards the state.""Manipur is once again in the grip of violence. For nearly two years, the people of the state have been facing violence, murder, and rape, which has forced them to migrate. Hundreds have died, thousands of people are homeless.

The Wayanad MP wrote on X, referring to the ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki communities.Further, she took on the prime minister for not visiting Manipur since the ethnic conflict began in May 2023.""He has not met any representative of the state, nor appealed for peace, nor made any concrete effort. This insensitive and irresponsible attitude is extremely unfortunate for any democracy. It is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure peace and security for the citizens of the country. To step back from this is to turn away from one's duty,"" Gandhi added.Jairam Ramesh, the grand old party's communications in-charge who has repeatedly criticized the PM on the Manipur issue, wrote a long social media post to slam him again.""Pain, distress, and agony of the people of Manipur continues unabated as five districts have been rocked by violence in the last 24 hours. In the February 2022 assembly election, the BJP won a majority on its own. However, a mere 15 months after that mandate, Manipur was left to burn from the night of 3 May 2023.

Even the governor had to travel from Imphal airport to his residence by helicopter .

‘Bihar First, Bihari First’: LJP Chief Chirag Paswan Ends Suspense, To Contest Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Union minister Chirag Paswan on Sunday claimed that Congress MP and leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , has already conceded defeat in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , citing Gandhi’s recent remarks targeting the Election Commission of India (ECI).Speaking to reporters, Paswan accused Gandhi of deflecting blame and targeting constitutional bodies instead of holding his own party accountable.""The problem with Congress and its leaders is that when introspection is needed, they look for excuses for losing elections,"" Paswan said, as quoted by the news agency ANI. ""If Rahul Gandhi needs to find faults in any institution, it should not be a constitutional institution, but his own Congress party. Blaming the Election Commission, accusing someone of fixing elections, saying that the EVM is faulty, all this shows that Rahul Gandhi has already accepted defeat in the Bihar Assembly elections. ""Bihar will go to the polls later this year.Paswan further predicted that after Bihar, the opposition will suffer defeats in Assam and West Bengal as well.Meanwhile, RJD leader and Bihar’s leader of opposition, Tejashwi Yadav , came out in strong support of Gandhi. Speaking in Patna, Yadav accused the BJP of compromising constitutional institutions, claiming, ""Ever since Narendra Modi has become the Prime Minister, all constitutional institutions have been hijacked.Before the ECI announces the elections, the BJP IT Cell knows the schedule.""Tejashwi said the opposition’s efforts were not just about power. ""Everyone is working together, not to form the government, but to strengthen Bihar,"" he added, backing Gandhi's criticism of the ECI.Gandhi, who is the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, had on Saturday posted on X criticising the ECI’s response to his allegations of rigging in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections. He wrote, “Dear EC, You are a Constitutional body. Releasing unsigned, evasive notes to intermediaries is not the way to respond to serious questions.”He urged the Commission to publish machine-readable electoral rolls and release all CCTV footage from polling booths post-5 pm to ensure transparency. “Evasion won't protect your credibility. Telling the truth will,” he wrote.The ECI later dismissed Gandhi’s remarks, calling his allegations ""unsubstantiated"" and an “affront to the rule of law.” The Commission said that all relevant facts had been shared with the Congress party in December 2024 and are publicly available.The poll panel warned that spreading misinformation disrespects the law and demotivates lakhs of honest poll workers. “After any unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying to defame the Election Commission... is completely absurd,” the Commission said in a detailed statement.In his op-ed titled Match-fixing Maharashtra, Gandhi had alleged that the state elections were a “blueprint for rigging democracy”, involving fake voters, inflated turnout, targeted bogus voting, and concealed evidence.","Union minister Chirag Paswan claims Rahul Gandhi has already conceded defeat in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.

Cash haul row: Justice Yashwant Varma left with only one option - how can he avoid impeachment?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-haul-row-justice-yashwant-varma-left-with-only-one-option-how-can-he-avoid-impeachment/articleshow/121705668.cms,"File photo: Justice Yashwant Varma (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court faces the prospect of impeachment in the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament after being indicted in a high-profile corruption case.According to officials cited by news agency PTI, resignation remains his only option to avoid a Parliamentary motion for removal, which, if passed, would strip him of pension and retirement benefits.Justice Varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his Delhi residence in March led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash in the outhouse. Though he denied knowledge of the money, a Supreme Court-appointed in-house panel, led by then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, found him culpable after recording witness statements and Varma’s own deposition.Based on this report, Justice Khanna urged the President and Prime Minister to initiate his removal, PTI reported.As per Article 217 of the Constitution, a High Court judge may resign by writing to the President.The resignation becomes valid without requiring formal acceptance. If a judge resigns, they retain post-retirement entitlements. However, if removed by Parliament, they lose all such benefits.In Parliament, a motion for removal must be supported by at least 50 Rajya Sabha or 100 Lok Sabha members. Once admitted, the Judges (Inquiry) Act of 1968 mandates a fresh three-member committee, including a Supreme Court judge, a High Court chief justice, and a distinguished jurist, to investigate the charges.However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju pointed out that the case is “slightly different” because an in-house committee has already concluded its probe. “It cannot be brushed aside,” Rijiju was quoted as saying by PTI, adding that reconciling the existing report with the statutory inquiry process will be a matter for the Speaker or Chairman to decide.Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, while meeting members of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association, expressed dismay over the lack of a criminal investigation into the matter. “A very painful incident happened... There was a cash haul, obviously tainted, unaccounted and illegal,” he said.Dhankhar criticised the judiciary’s internal mechanism for shielding its members from FIRs, saying, “Unless permission is accorded by a functionary at the highest level in the judiciary, an FIR can’t be registered.”Justice Varma has since been transferred to the Allahabad High Court, where he has not been allotted any judicial duties. Rijiju has begun consultations with political parties to build consensus on the motion, which could be the first impeachment to be taken up in the new Parliament building.The Monsoon session of Parliament is scheduled from July 21 to August 12.","Justice Yashwant Varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his Delhi residence in March led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash.

NEW DELHI: After a gap of 17 days, Delhi's maximum temperature surpassed 40 degrees Celsius on Sunday, settling at 42.1C, two notches above normal, at Safdarjung, the city's base station. The Met office has issued a 'yellow' alert for heatwave conditions at isolated places on Monday and Tuesday as the mercury may touch 45C.The heatwave alert for the capital came as scorching temperatures swept Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. In Haryana, Sirsa recorded the highest maximum temperature at 45.8C while Chandigarh recorded the season's highest maximum so far at 42.1C. In Rajasthan, maximum temperature in several areas remained above 45 degrees, with Sri Ganganagar being the hottest district in the state at 47.4C. The Met office has predicted that the intense heatwave will continue in the coming days.In Delhi, due to regular rain, accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds, temperatures have stayed below normal. However, before Sunday, the mercury crossed 40C on May 21, recording 40.7. The 17-day streak broke on Sunday, though the city did not meet the criteria for heatwave conditions. The season's hottest day was May 16, at 42.3C.The relative humidity oscillated between 31% and 70% on Sunday. The heat index or feel-like temperature was 47.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.6 degrees Celsius. Delhi did not experience a heatwave day in May, although three such days were recorded in April this year.Some areas were hotter than the city’s base station.At 44.1 degrees Celsius, Ayanagar in south-west Delhi was the hottest station on Sunday, followed by 43.6 degrees at Palam. The maximum temperature settled at 42.3 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road, 42.9 degrees Celsius at Ridge in north Delhi, 40.6 at Rajghat, 41.2 at Pusa, 41.6 at Najafgarh, 40.4 at Mayur Vihar, 41.5 at Gurgaon, 41.4 at Noida, 42.2 at Faridabad, and 39.7 at Ghaziabad.“The maximum temperatures have been recorded between 42-44 degrees Celsius over Delhi with departures of about 2-3 degrees.

It settled at 47.4 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan’s Gangapur. In just five days, the mercury saw a rise of 6 to 8 degrees Celsius across the region.”“The mercury stayed below normal during the past few days due to moist winds coming from either the Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal. However, the last thunderstorm activity was on June 4, and since then, dry conditions have prevailed, leading to a rise in temperatures,” he added. IMD has issued a ‘yellow’ alert for hot and humid conditions for Wednesday and Thursday as the mercury may stay between 41 and 43 degrees Celsius. Respite from the sizzling weather is expected from June 13. “Due to the confluence of winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, rain and thunderstorms are likely to start from east UP and Uttarakhand from June 11 night,” said Mishra. The met department has predicted rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds from the night of June 12 to June 14 in Delhi.","Temperatures rise 6-8 degrees in just 5 days in Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan.

'EC Acting Like Govt Stooge': Congress, TMC Blast Modi Govt After Rahul's Remarks, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing” Maharashtra polls, saying that the “absurd” allegations – already dismissed in a letter to the Congress dated Dec 24, 2024 – not only demotivate lakhs of govt staff who work untiringly to deliver transparent elections but also “bring into disrepute” party’s own representatives from the polling station to the constituency level.“Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held. After an unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying todefame the Election Commission by saying that it is compromised, is completely absurd,” an EC functionary told TOI.EC also found it strange that the LoP, instead of directly writing to the EC, has thus far chosen to air his grievances at various other forums – party meetings, Lok Sabha, even interactions on foreign soil and, now, an Op-Ed article. “If he is aggrieved, why is he shying from write to EC directly or seeking a meeting?” asked the functionary mentioned above.On Rahul faulting the appointment process of CEC and election commissioners, officials underlined that it was only under Modi govt that the law was amended to allow LoP a say in the appointments. “All CECs and election commissioners under previous Cong govts were appointed at the sole will of the Executive,” said an officer.Stating that Rahul, in his Op-ED article, has only harped on the allegations denied by the poll panel in December 2024, with additional clarifications published in TOI on April 22, EC officials rejected his charge of extraordinary surge in last two hours. It emphasised that over 6.4 crore electors in Maharashtra, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm on November 20, 2024, had voted. Thus, about 58 lakh votes were polled per hour on an average. “Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,” an EC functionary pointed out.As regards the anomalies alleged by Rahul in roll revision, the functionary underlined that over 27,000 booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by the Congress were actively involved at every step of the summary revision of Maharashtra rolls ahead of the state polls, including raising claims and objections against the draft roll.Interestingly, while electors increased by 8.1% in Maharashtra since the last assembly poll, the corresponding rise was 13.4% for Jharkhand and 16.2% for Telangana. Congress won both Jharkhand (in alliance with JMM) and Telangana polls.Even after the final roll was published with a total 9.7 crore electors and its copies shared with all political parties including the Congress – allowing them to file two-point appeals, if dissatisfied – only 89 appeals were filed before the first appellate authority (district magistrate) and one before the second (chief electoral officer). “It is thus amply clear that there was no grievance of Congress or any other political party before the conduct of Maharashtra polls,” said the EC functionary.As regards allegations of irregularities in polling, EC officials shared that polling agents of all candidates and parties, including Congress, were present at the polling stations. “Congress’s nominated candidates or their authorized agents did not raise any substantiated allegations with regard to any kind of abnormal voting at the time of scrutiny before the returning officer and the election observers,” said an officer.“It appears that all these facts brought to the Congress notice by EC in its letter dated December 24, 2024, have completely been ignored,” said an EC functionary.","Election Commission officials slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing’ Maharashtra polls. “Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held.

Conrad K Sangma praises Meghalaya police





NEW DELHI: The police got a major breakthrough in the murder of Indore resident Raja Raghuvanshi during his honeymoon in Meghalaya after arresting his wife, Sonam, along with three other accused. According to police, Sonam allegedly orchestrated the killing with the help of hired assailants. The arrests were made following intensive investigations, and the case continues to unfold.Teams from the Meghalaya and Indore police are expected to reach Ghazipur today to continue the investigation. Police will escort Sonam to Meghalaya to recreate the crime scene where Raja Raghuvanshi was found dead.The arrest was made with coordination between local and Meghalaya police, involving three state police forces in the investigation.Devi Singh, the father of Sonam, strongly denied the allegations against his daughter and accused the Meghalaya police of fabricating the case.""My daughter is innocent. I have trust in my daughter. She cannot do this (kill her husband). They got married with the consent of both families. The state (Meghalaya) government has been lying from the beginning. My daughter came to a dhaba in Ghazipur last night and she called her brother. Police went to the dhaba, and she was taken from there,"" Sonam Raghuvanshi's father, Devi Singh said,""I have not been able to speak to my daughter.Why will my daughter do such a thing (kill her husband)? The Meghalaya Police is lying. My daughter reached Ghazipur on her own. She was not arrested in Meghalaya. We were thinking of meeting Madhya Pradesh CM and then Union HM Amit Shah to request a CBI inquiry. Meghalaya Police is making up stories. Let the CBI inquiry begin, all officers at the police station (in Meghalaya) will be behind bars. "" Singh added.Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi, newlyweds from Indore, arrived in Meghalaya for their honeymoon in May. On May 22, the couple reached Mawlakhiyat village and undertook the steep 3,000-step trek to Nongriat, known for its iconic living root bridges. They spent the night in a homestay and were last seen checking out the next morning.Their rented scooter was later found abandoned on May 24 near a cafe along the Shillong–Sohra road. After days of no contact, Raja was reported missing.On June 4, Raja’s decomposed body was found inside a deep gorge near Weisawdong Falls. His identity was confirmed by a tattoo on his hand—“Raja and a lady”—and a waterproof smartwatch he had borrowed from his brother.

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu ’s ruling party, the DMK , once again raised objections to the use of Hindi in non-Hindi regions. DMK leader and MP Kanimozhi flagged what she termed the “imposition” of Hindi after responding to a post that showed Hindi being prominently used on Chennai Park railway station signboard.Taking to social media platform X, Kanimozhi appeared to target the BJP-led Centre, which the DMK has often accused of promoting Hindi at the expense of regional languages.In her post, written in Tamil, she said, loosely translated: “It began in Kallakurichi and continues to Chennai Poonthottam. They will not stop imposing it. Nor will we cease resisting it.”The BJP-led central government and the DMK government in Tamil Nadu have long been at odds over the language issue, with chief minister MK Stalin and his party repeatedly opposing what they describe as the imposition of Hindi from the North and with the support of Centre.Language politics is expected to play a key role in shaping electoral prospects in Tamil Nadu, which is heading for assembly elections to its 234-seat legislature.

New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen. A decision will be likely taken soon on stopping the practice of manually feeding vehicle registration numbers in the system to deduct toll. In such cases, there is a possibility of the toll attendants noting down wrong details. This becomes an unnecessary hassle for commuters.""The ministry said that with the implementation of FASTag, the average time taken to cross toll plaza has reduced to 40 seconds compared with the earlier 12.2 minutes per vehicle under the manual tolling system.In a separate written reply to a question on the total toll collection, the road transport ministry said in the past three quarters of the financial year 2025-26, Rs 50,195 crore was collected as user fee across the national highway and expressway network.During the entire last financial year, Rs 61,508 crore was collected as toll, the ministry further said.","NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions.

‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to implement in Tamil Nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during Special Intensive Revision of West Bengal electoral rolls, prompting the EC to request the SC to extend it to all states undergoing SIR of voter lists.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, dealing with petitions by politicians from ruling DMK party, said the names of voters categorised under ‘logical discrepancies’ by EC would be displayed at public places, panchayat and taluk offices along with the reasons for such categorisation and documents required to be furnished by them.“The person receiving the documents from voters would issue a receipt. However, hearing of voters for inclusion of their names in electoral rolls would be conducted at taluka level officers,” the bench said and directed the TN govt to provide adequate staff to the EC to carry out the task. It allowed the voters to submit the documents within 10 days of display of the list by EC.It also asked the DGP, SPs and collectors to ensure no law and order situation emerges to scuttle the SIR exercise. This prompted EC counsel and senior advocate D S Naidu to request the SC to extend the order to all states where SIR of electoral rolls are being carried out.In its order, the bench recorded - “We expect the EC to comply with these directions on a pan-India basis.”In another hearing, the CJI-led bench concluded hearing on the challenge to the constitutional validity of SIR, which was first carried out in Bihar and then extended to 12 other states, after a three month long hearing that saw contrasting arguments put forth by the poll body and petitioners.Appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, advocate Prashant Bhushan said EC cannot remove a person from the voter list if he/she gives a self-declaration claiming to be an Indian citizen.He said if anyone objects to the citizenship of a voter, then the onus is on the complainant to produce the voter list from Bangladesh to substantiate the accusation of illegal migrants. The bench laughed and said, “You know this is not possible. How will someone get the voter list from Bangladesh containing the name of an alleged illegal migrant figuring in the voter list of an Indian state.”",Supreme Court asks the Election Commission to implement in Tamil Nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during Special Intensive Revision of West Bengal electoral rolls.

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

New Delhi: As Republic Day celebrations drew to a close with the Beating Retreat ceremony, Vijay Chowk reverberated with three of composer AR Rahman's iconic songs - Oscar-winning 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam'.Earlier this month, when asked about his absence from Hindi-film music during an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman said, ""It might be a communal thing also... but it is not in my face"". He later said that intentions could be ""misundersood sometimes"" and that he was grateful to the country.While the Central Armed Police Forces band performed ""Jai Ho"", the Indian Navy band played 'Bharat humko...'.The song 'Aarambh hai prachand' from the movie Gulaal was played by the Indian Army band. Vande Mataram on its 150th anniversary and Operation Sindoor were featured prominently during the ceremony on Thursday evening, which was presided over by President Droupadi Murmu, who arrived in the ceremonial buggy. Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi , defence minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the three service chiefs were also present.The bands stood various formations that included 'Amar Jawan': a tribute to Indian Army bravehearts, 'Deva Vyuha: a battle formation referred to in Mahabharata battle formation against Bhishm Pitamah and 'Ardhachandra Vyuha': a half-moon battle formation.LED screens placed at the venue also showed a video clip of a BrahMos missile hitting a target; instruments of several band members were wrapped with LEDs on which the logo of Op Sindoor shone. Images of Rafale, Tejas, Su-30, BrahMos, S-400 air defence system, Netra, Prachand and C-130 also played on the screens.Later, the PM shared the glimpses from Beating Retreat 2026, saying that ""performances by the various bands were memorable"".In a series of posts on X, Modi said: ""Air Force Band was exceptional... They performed 'Brave Warrior', 'Twilight', 'Alert (Post Horn Gallop)' and 'Flying Star' impeccably. The Sindoor formation was brilliant!""On the naval band, he posted, ""Simply outstanding! The Naval Band's performances included 'Namaste', 'Sagar Pawan', 'Matribhumi', 'Tejasvi' and 'Jai Bharati'. The Matsya Yantra formation was flawless.""","Ar Rahman's iconic songs 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam' played at Beating Retreat ceremony.

Sibal said that these malicious and misleading statements, which he never said and debunked by fact checkers, were relied upon. The activist was detained in Sept and he has been in custody since then.Highlighting Wangchuk has been holding protests to protect ecology and environment of Ladakh, Sibal said speaking against a govt cannot be termed as an act against the country and anti-national. ""He had said he will not allow violence to take place. The 6th schedule was a promise given by a political party. It was given in 2020. If in 2025 he says fulfil it before elections then what's wrong with it? Anti-govt sentiment is not a security threat to the country.I can criticise the govt. That's what democracy is about. And part of that is peaceful protests, marches and criticising the govt,,"" he said.Reading from the transcript of his speech and interviews, Sibal put all these statements to establish that ""some IT cell"" took a small clip and put it in a different context to spark the controversy. ""A detaining authority relying on a statement must rely on the entire statement and cannot rely on a sentence or two...The whole detention order is based on excerpts, out of context, misleading, false, thereby suggesting a selective approach, malafide in nature, to ensure that I am detained,"" Sibal said.Referring to his alleged statement to overthrow the govt, Sibal made the bench to go through the transcript .""The correct translation is - I say if the govt does not have affection for citizens, care for its environment, then such a govt is an obstacle in the progress of the nation. He says I too can bring change. We all need to be prepared to save mother Ladakh and mother India. What is wrong in this?"" he said.On disrespecting a goddess, Sibal said, ""The unedited version brings out a complete picture. It was meant to say that after liberating Ladakh from Kashmir, the central govt failed to extend its promise of constitutional safeguards under the 6th Schedule. He says like Rama got Sita from the clutches of Ravana and left her in the market, the central govt did a similar thing with Ladakh."" He said that the activist had praised govt and Prime Minister Narendra Modi multiple times on international platforms and he never spoke against the country.

ADGP Suspension Revoked, Chennai Triple Murder, TVK Drops Vijay And More





CHENNAI: The city police on Wednesday stumbled into a shocking triple murder while probing the mystery behind an abandoned sack containing the body of a guest worker on Jan 26. The body was found on the roadside in an upscale neighbourhood in Adyar. Now, it turns out that the guest worker Gaurav Kumar’s wife Minukumari and son Birmani Kumar too had been murdered and their bodies dumped at different locations in the vicinity.While the child’s body was recovered from the Buckingham Canal in Adyar, the woman’s body is yet to be traced. A total of five people, all natives of Bihar, have been arrested in connection with the murders.Police said Gaurav Kumar of Nalanda district in Bihar was a security guard at a private company in Sriperumbudur, for the past two years. On Jan 21, he, along with his wife Minukumari and son Birmani Kumar, returned from a trip to Bihar and moved to the city seeking a job.Through contacts in his hometown, he approached Krishna Prasad, 60, who is also from Bihar and who worked as a security guard and lived with his family in Taramani. Krishna Prasad introduced Gaurav Kumar to several acquaintances from Bihar who were employed as security guards in nearby buildings.Gaurav Kumar and his family stayed at Krishna Prasad’s house and in other residences where migrant workers from Bihar lived, while he searched for a job.On Jan 25, during a drinking session with another security guard Sikander, 33, and his four friends, a fight erupted during which Gaurav Kumar was attacked first. When Minukumari attempted to flee with her son, the gang attacked them with an iron rod. Both Minukumari and Birmani Kumar died on the spot.In order to divert police attention, Sikander and his associates wrapped Gaurav Kumar’s body in a sack and dumped it in front of a two-wheeler showroom in Indira Nagar First Avenue. Police have secured CCTV camera footage showing how two suspects transported the body on a two-wheeler, placing it between the rider and the pillion before dumping it.The child’s body was dumped amidst bushes along the Buckingham Canal near Madhya Kailash, while Minukumari’s body was wrapped in a sack and dumped in a garbage bin near the Indira Nagar MRTS station.","Gaurav Kumar of Nalanda district in Bihar was a security guard at a private company in Sriperumbudur, for the past two years.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

MCX Gold, on the weekly timeframe, continues to demonstrate healthy bullish momentum following a decisive breakout from a brief consolidation phase and is presently trading near its all-time high of 164,900. The upside bias is firmly established, with minimal evidence of a trend reversal, indicating that the advance is likely to stay toward higher levels. The recent acceleration further confirms the strength and sustainability of the move, while the broader outlook remains constructive as long as prices sustain above the weekly low.From a weekly perspective, the 157,500 zone emerges as a key support level, representing the recent lows of the previous week. Any retracement toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this level preserves the bullish market structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well poised to advance toward the 185,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective upside is in harmony with the broader bullish trend and underlines the strength of prevailing market momentum.Additionally, the development of higher highs and higher lows over the week further reinforces positive sentiment, setting the stage for a sustained upward trajectory.Overall, gold maintains an optimistic bias, with the broader technical framework decisively favouring trend continuation. As long as prices remain firmly above the critical 157,500 support level, the bullish formation remains intact. Supported by robust momentum indicators and a favourable market sentiment backdrop, the metal appears well positioned to extend its advance in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has registered new all-time highs for the fifth consecutive week, extending a well-established sequence of higher highs that has persisted for several months. With little evidence of momentum decline, the overall bias remains decisively positive, and any corrective pullbacks are likely to attract renewed buying interest. We recommend positioning in line with the prevailing trend, which remains firmly bullish, while refraining from positions that go against this strong upward momentum.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a resurgence in trend strength, enhancing the prospects for additional upside. Provided prices continue to hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support is located around the 340,000 zone, which may offer an attractive accumulation opportunity. Any retracement toward this area is likely to draw fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and preserve upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 415,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move reflects a continuation of the current bullish phase, supported by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly anchored above the 340,000 support level, silver is expected to maintain its bullish trend, with considerable scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver are moving to newer highs, and the bullish momentum is likely to continue in the coming sessions as well, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing. When the iron is hot, that’s when you strike. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.”Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland after 14 votes went against their participation, with the ICC citing logistical and contractual issues. Pakistan backed Bangladesh in the vote but eventually went along with the final decision.“We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over,” Latif said. “If we boycott now, it won’t have the same impact.”Pakistan chairman Mohsin Naqvi had hinted earlier this week that the board could consider a principled stand similar to Bangladesh’s, but no formal announcement followed. The T20 World Cup will go ahead with Pakistan participating under a hybrid model, with matches involving India scheduled at neutral venues until 2027.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup.

A chilling call



'We gave them Bullet bike, gold jewellery'





NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando died after being hit by dumbbell at her home in west Delhi.According to news agency PTI, Kajal Chaudhary, who was four months pregnant, was posted with the Special Cell of Delhi Police.She was at her residence in Mohan Garden on January 22 when the alleged assault took place.Her husband, Ankur, a clerk with the Ministry of Defence posted in Delhi Cantonment, was arrested hours later.Kajal succumbed to her injuries on January 27, after battling for life for five days at a hospital in Ghaziabad.Her brother, Nikhil, a constable posted at Parliament Street Police Station, told PTI that he was on the phone when the attack occurred.Also read: ‘Our son would’ve got a car’: Even after giving Bullet bike, dowry harassment continued, says family of slain SWAT commando “He told me to put the call on recording, said it could be used as police evidence; (then) told me he was killing her. And then, I heard her screams,” Nikhil recalled, describing the moments before the call ended abruptly.According to Nikhil, the sequence of events began with a call from Ankur. “He called me and said, ‘Apni behen ko samjha le’ (Make your sister understand). I asked him to calm down and immediately called my sister,” he said.“She normally wouldn’t tell us much about what was happening, but that day she was sharing her ordeal. While we were speaking, he got angry that she was telling me things and snatched the phone from her,” Nikhil said.“Then he said to me, ‘Is call ko recording pe rakh, police evidence me kaam aayega. Main maar raha hoon teri behen ko. Police mera kuch nahi kar payegi’ (Put this call on recording, it will be useful as police evidence. I am killing your sister. Police won’t be able to do anything). Then I heard her screams. The call ended abruptly,” he said.Barely five minutes later, Nikhil said he received another call. “He (Ankur) said, ‘Ye mar gayi hai. Hospital aajao’ (She is dead. Come to the hospital). We rushed there with police personnel. He and his family were already present. When I saw my sister not even an enemy kills someone like this,” he said.The family alleged that Kajal sustained severe head injuries and had multiple wounds across her body. Nikhil said they attempted to admit her to several hospitals but were allegedly told her chances of survival were minimal before she was finally admitted to a Ghaziabad hospital.The family has accused Ankur and his relatives of prolonged torture and dowry harassment, including during Kajal’s pregnancy.The couple has a one-and-a-half-year-old son, who is currently with his maternal grandparents.Recalling an earlier incident, Nikhil said Kajal had been slapped by her husband around five months ago.“I went there and asked her to come with me. Ankur apologised and swore on his child that he wouldn’t repeat it. I told my sister she could return home whenever she wanted and didn’t have to stay there,” he said.He also alleged that Kajal was made to do household chores despite being pregnant. “She would cook, wash clothes and utensils despite being pregnant,” he claimed.“Her son doesn’t know anything about the incident, and we have decided that we will only raise him. We will tell him when he is mature to understand such things,” Nikhil told PTI.Kajal’s father, Rakesh, alleged persistent dowry demands.“We gave them a Bullet bike, gold jewellery and cash at the wedding, but they said our son would have got a car (had he married someone else). Later, my daughter even arranged a car, but they didn't stop harassing her. We couldn't even speak freely to her,” he said.Her mother said the family had spent around Rs 20 lakh on the marriage and taken loans. “He (Ankur) had also taken Rs 5 lakh from her. She (Kajal) suffered a lot. I want justice. He is a monster,” she said.The couple had known each other since their college days in Panipat and married on November 23, 2023.Due to frequent disputes at their native home in Ganaur, Haryana, they shifted to a rented accommodation in Mohan Garden in December 2024, but tensions reportedly continued.Police said financial stress and domestic disputes were among the factors behind the conflict. “The couple had taken some loans and often had arguments over finances and household expenses,” a Delhi Police officer said.“On January 22, Ankur allegedly first banged Kajal’s head against a door frame before attacking her with a dumbbell,” the officer added.A case was registered at Mohan Garden police station based on Nikhil’s complaint. “He was initially booked for attempt to murder. After her death, the charges will be converted to murder,” the officer said.","A 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando died after being hit by dumbbell at her home.

NCP in Catch-22: Ajit Pawar's 'last wish' and Mahayuti alliance; calls for Sunetra to step in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncp-in-catch-22-ajit-pawars-last-wish-and-mahayuti-alliance-calls-for-sunetra-to-step-in/articleshow/127780212.cms,"Will the party merge with the rival faction of Sharad Pawar?

to replace Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra cabinet?

Who will lead the party?

NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Ajit Pawar has left his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), with many challenges. After losing its most skilful political manager, the party is now in a Catch-22 situation over a possible merger with the rival faction, while also keeping the alliance with the BJP intact.As “Ajit Dada” was cremated in Baramati on Thursday after a tragic plane crash, four questions are staring straight at the party.Amid the ongoing speculations, the Pawar family has to take a call over the merger of the party, which underwent a split in 2023. According to senior NCP leader and a minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, Narhari Zirwal said that the “two factions are already together”, claiming that there was “no point in remaining scattered.”“The two factions are already together (for local body polls). Everyone has realised that there is no point in remaining scattered and we have to be together,"" Zirwal said.Meanwhile, state NCP (Sharad Pawar) president Shashikant Shinde told news agency PTI that Ajit Pawar, before his death, Ajit had spoke about sitting together and taking a decision on the merger of the two NCPs after municipal and local body polls in Maharashtra.“When we had met for an alliance of the two parties for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad corporation elections (which took place on January 15), he (Ajit) had said let’s sit together and discuss (merger) after Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls (scheduled on February 5),” he said.“Ajit Dada (elder brother) was an emotional man and wanted the two factions to come together and the (Pawar) family to remain united. He had felt enough was enough. If the family and parties want a reconciliation, we have no problem. Now, we have to see if we can fulfil what became his last wish,” he added.This comes after both the factions contested the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won only 27 seats and NCP (SP) three seats against the BJP’s tally of 119, whereas in the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party got 37 and Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, while the BJP got 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite his old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.After the merger, the united NCP will also have to take a call on whether to continue to stay in the Mahayuti alliance or step out and join the opposition.According to political analysts, if NCP (SP)’s working president Supriya Sule takes a call to join the opposition, several NCP MLAs could oppose the move and switch to Shiv Sena or the BJP.However, if the party decides to stay in the alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition will not want their group to compromise on Phule-Ambedkar-Shahu’s ideology.NCP leaders are also pushing Sunetra Pawar — wife of Ajit Pawar — as his replacement in the Fadnavis cabinet. Narhari Zirwal said it is the people’s wish that late Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member, be inducted into the state ministry.Asked about the NCP’s future after the untimely death of Ajit Pawar, who was also the party president, Zirwal said that people want “vahini” (sister-in-law, referring to Sunetra Pawar) to be made a cabinet member.“We will talk to our leadership about it (inducting Sunetra in the cabinet) and take a decision,” Zirwal, a close confidante of Ajit Pawar, said.Given that Sunetra hasn’t been politically active despite being a Rajya Sabha MP, it will be interesting to see whether she will be allotted a seat in the Maharashtra cabinet. And even if she is given a seat in the cabinet, will she be made deputy chief minister or finance minister of the state — the posts Ajit Pawar held?In a situation where the merger plan fails, another question arises over who will become the president of the party. While former Union minister and party working president Praful Patel and state unit chief Sunil Tatkare are likely contenders, the Pawars would be reluctant to let someone from outside the family lead the party.Another NCP leader and Ajit Pawar confidante, Pramod Hindurao, maintained that Sunetra Pawar should carry forward the legacy of her husband and take care of party workers.“Considering the sympathy factor, Sunetra can be the option to not only lead the party but also negotiate merger talks with the other group, who are also part of her family,” political analyst Prakash Pawar told TOI.","Ajit Pawar's sudden death has left his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), with many challenges.

Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday put on hold the controversial UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, taking serious exception to several of its provisions and saying that these could fuel societal division and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi heard three petitions and said that while implementation of the 2026 regulations would be on hold till further orders, the 2012 regulations would continue to be in force to address grievances relating to caste-based discrimination against students on campuses of educational institutions.""We are sorry to say, the Regulations, prima facie, the language is completely vague, the provisions are capable of being misused, and the language needs to be re-modulated and redesigned,"" the bench said and asked for the setting up of an experts panel to examine the regulations.Terming the new regulations as regressive, the CJI said, ""In the country, after 75 years, whatever we have gained to move towards the goal of casteless society, are we enacting a regressive policy? No doubt, there has to be some effective mechanism to deal with caste-based discrimination.""The justices said that while they were all for regulations for creation of ""a free, inclusive and an equitable atmosphere in Universities....there are four or five serious concerns about the Regulations. If those are not addressed, the Regulations will otherwise have sweeping consequences that will divide society and lead to many dangerous impacts on the country.""The CJI flagged another provision in the regulations as problematic, pointing out that it proposed separate hostels based on the caste of students. ""For God's sake, please do not do that. In hostels, students from every community live together. There are inter-caste marriages also. We should move towards a casteless society by assimilating students of all regions and (students of) all castes must have equal rights and live harmoniously in universities. We cannot go backwards. There must not be any segregation.""The hearing took place amid agitation by sections of upper caste students against the regulations for allegedly being discriminatory and exclusionary and for being oblivious to the changed socio-economic milieu where newly empowered OBCs have also been accused of discriminating against others, including those from upper castes.Significantly, the OBCs are not under the purview of the 2012 regulations which snap back in action after the SC's order on Thursday.Leading the arguments for petitioners, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the Regulations presume that only a certain category of students belonging to certain castes face discrimination in universities. They keep general category candidates outside their purview, leaving such students without remedies for discrimination faced by them.Asking Centre and UGC to respond to the petitions by March 19, the bench said, ""We want to examine the constitutional validity and legality of 2026 Regulations. We would like the Union govt, with the concurrence and approval of the court, to constitute a panel of experts comprising eminent academicians and scholars who understand our social conditions to study the regulations and its possible impacts.""The regulations deal only with caste-based discrimination and presume that India is divided on basis of caste and do not deal with issues like ragging, North-South divide, cultural diversity, which too lead to discrimination, the petitioners said.The CJI Kant-led bench said, ""Ragging is the worst thing that happens on campuses. Children coming from south India to north India and vice-versa, and from north-east to other states of the country, carry their cultural values with them.""","Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March 19.

Smithsonian museum to return 3 bronzes to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smithsonian-museum-to-return-3-bronzes-to-india/articleshow/127733435.cms,"Museums abroad are increasingly confronting the legacy of looted cultural heritage in their collections, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art has become the latest institution to act. On Wednesday, the museum announced it will return three sculptures to India after rigorous research revealed the sculptures had been removed illegally from temples in Tamil Nadu The sculptures 'Shiva Nataraja' (Chola period, ca. 990), 'Somaskanda' (Chola period, 12th century) and 'Saint Sundarar with Paravai' (Vijayanagar period, 16th century) are examples of the rich artistry of South Indian bronze casting.The Indian govt has agreed to place the 'Shiva Nataraja' on long-term loan. This arrangement will allow the museum to publicly share the full story of the object's origins, removal and return. It will be on view as part of the exhibition 'The Art of Knowing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Himalayas.'As part of a systematic review of its South Asian collections, the National Museum of Asian Art undertook a detailed investigation into the provenance of the three sculptures, scrutinizing each work's transaction history.In 2023, in collaboration with the Photo Archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry, museum researchers confirmed that the bronzes had been photographed in temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959. The Archaeological Survey of India subsequently reviewed these findings and affirmed the sculptures had been removed in violation of Indian laws.""The National Museum of Asian Art is committed to stewarding cultural heritage responsibly and advancing transparency in our collection,"" said museum director Chase F Robinson.The Shiva Nataraja belonged to the Sri Bhava Aushadesvara Temple in Thanjavur district, where it was photographed in 1957. The bronze was later acquired by the National Museum of Asian Art from Doris Wiener Gallery in New York in 2002. A researcher at the museum determined that the Doris Wiener Gallery had provided falsified documentation to facilitate the sale to the museum. The Somaskanda and Saint Sundarar with Paravai was part of a gift of 1,000 objects. Research showed that it was from the Visvanatha Temple in Alattur village, Mannarkudi taluk, and the Saint Sundarar with Paravai at the Shiva Temple was from Veerasolapuram village, Kallakuruchchi taluk.","Sculptures were removed from temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959.

New Delhi: Eliminating the need to submit physical copies of Aadhaar for verification or visiting Aadhaar centres for updating personal details, govt Wednesday launched the new Aadhaar app that will let people manage and verify their identities digitally.Aadhaar details will be stored securely on mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry and submit a physical card for the purposes of verification. Changes to addresses and mobile numbers can also now be made in minutes, subject to Unique Identification Authority of India’s ( UIDAI ) confirmation.Users will also be able to monitor their authentication history, meaning they will be able to keep a record of the places where their Aadhaar details has been used for verification, enhancing oversight and control over the use of their digital identity.At the event to unveil the new app, electronics and IT secretary S Krishnan said govt is conscious of privacy concerns and has built the platform around the principle of data minimisation and reports of Aadhaar data leaks in the past had stemmed largely from excessive data collection by third parties and not due to breaches in the central database.“Collection of Aadhaar data by these third parties creates vulnerability.This is what we are trying to minimise,” Krishnan further added.The app allows management of up to five Aadhaar profiles on a single device linked to the same phone number. It provides users with the ability to selectively share personal information, ensuring only the necessary details are disclosed and provides a QR code identity scan feature which will enable users to scan it at authorised terminals to confirm their identity securely and quickly.","Aadhaar details will be stored securely on mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry and submit a physical card for the purposes of verification.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

OPS's reunion pitch: A challenge or a last attempt?

Why EPS rejected the offer

Why OPS looks desperate ahead of 2026 polls

3 scenarios for OPS ahead of assembly election

Scenario 1: Backdoor NDA entry via AMMK (most likely)

OPS joins NDA through Dhinakaran's AMMK arrangement.

Gets 2–3 seats from AMMK's quota.

Stays in the game, avoids total invisibility.

Risk

Scenario 2: Go solo-lite with BJP support (possible)

OPS contests with BJP backing, either on BJP's symbol or as an Independent.

Helps BJP widen footprint in the south.

Keeps OPS out of AMMK shadow.

Risk

Scenario 3: AIADMK reunion miracle (least likely)

EPS allows a return under some formula.

OPS returns with symbolic honour.

Reunion narrative energises some cadres.

Risk

NEW DELHI: Expelled AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) on Thursday publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami ’'s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu 's 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary TTV Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. ""I am ready for that. Are they ready?"" he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.But EPS's response was a door-slam: ""There is no chance of admitting OPS into AIADMK. OPS has already been removed from the basic membership position."" EPS cited the party's general council, which had expelled OPS in 2023, saying there could be no re-induction.The sharp exchange has reopened a question Tamil Nadu politics has been quietly circling for months: what does OPS do in 2026. A three-time chief minister and once a stand-in in AIADMK for J Jayalalithaa after her death, why is he pushing so hard now?OPS's reunion line comes amid a BJP-driven effort to revive and expand the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu. With BJP increasingly invested in forging an anti-DMK front, the party has been nudging splintered AIADMK factions to align, or at least avoid damaging vote-splits.In that backdrop, OPS framed reunification as the ""natural"" outcome if EPS and Dhinakaran who were bitter rivals could close ranks. If such a rapprochement is possible, he argued, what stops his return?OPS also returned to his familiar ideological peg: the restoration of MGR-era by-laws and ""cadres' rights"".His committee, later evolved into a kazhagam, he said, exists only to reclaim the party's original rules, not to become a full political party for 2026.When asked about reported talks with BJP's Tamil Nadu in-charge Piyush Goyal and rumours of a 2-seat offer, OPS refused to answer directly, calling it ""parama ragasiyam"" (a profound secret). Dhinakaran, meanwhile, positioned himself as mediator, urging OPS to join NDA to revive the ""Amma regime"".EPS's refusal is being framed by his camp as a matter of party discipline and organisational authority.AIADMK leaders point to the 2023 general council decision expelling OPS for ""anti-party activities"", saying it was a unanimous verdict by a council of over 2,500 members. EPS has repeatedly argued the party cannot return to ""dual leadership"" politics, and that the focus is to defeat the DMK with a consolidated NDA.The BJP too has indicated where it stands. Union home minister Amit Shah has backed EPS as the NDA's leading face for the 2026 contest, with decisions on the future shape of the alliance to be taken post-election.In other words, OPS's biggest problem is not just EPS. It is that the BJP's Tamil Nadu unit has moved on without him.OPS’s urgency is rooted in one blunt reality - political isolation is fast turning into electoral irrelevance.He is a former chief minister with three stints, but in Tamil Nadu’s current alliance arithmetic, OPS has limited negotiating power. This is because he no longer controls three negotiation essentials - a party, a symbol or a demonstrable seat-winning base.In the last two election cycles, OPS has failed to convert name recognition into measurable electoral influence. In 2021 assembly polls, his camp failed to emerge as a force. In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, OPS did not win a seat, contesting as an Independent under the jackfruit symbol, which he described as a ""test of cadre support"" for his reunification pitch.Meanwhile, OPS has also been structurally locked out of the AIADMK. EPS’s camp points to OPS's 2023 expulsion for ""anti-party activities"", endorsed by a 2,500+ member general council, making re-entry not a matter of personal goodwill but a question of organisational authority. Without access to district units and booth machinery, OPS is left with .just sentiment politics and not the election machinery.The bigger squeeze is coming from the NDA itself. BJP, which once saw OPS as a useful fracture point inside AIADMK, now appears firmly invested in EPS-led consolidation. In this ecosystem, OPS is being offered only a small role: TOI sources suggest 2–3 seats, either through AMMK's quota or a BJP-backed independent route.That might be why OPS is pushing ""reunion"" so publicly. In 2026, his fight is not for power, but to stay politically alive.Apart from this, OPS is also facing a personal political deadline. At around 75, he has limited time to rebuild. His reunion pitch for EPS can therefore be read not only as a negotiation tactic, but also a legacy attempt - a final effort to remain relevant in the story of AIADMK after Jayalalithaa.With EPS shutting the door, OPS effectively has only three options left ahead of assembly poll:: Becomes a junior player under Dhinakaran and BJP, with limited voice.: Without AIADMK machinery, OPS may remain confined to pockets.: EPS may only accept him on strict terms, or not at all.OPS's recent ""I'm ready for reunion"" pitch is not merely a message to EPS or Dhinakaran.It is a signal to the BJP-led NDA: don't finalise 2026 election plan without me. But Tamil Nadu's political reality is unforgiving. Currently, the NDA alliance math is being built around EPS-first consolidation and OPS is being negotiated not as a central point but as a marginal add-on, with talk of only 2–3 seats.That is why he has wrapped a survival bid in the language of legacy - MGR by-laws, cadre rights and unity.The question now is simple: will the AIADMK gates reopen for OPS, or will 2026 mark his last election appearance as a consequential player?","Expelled AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami ’'s (EPS) AIadMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu's 2026 assembly polls.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy on Thursday raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and slow down industrial growth.“MSMEs-related reforms need to cut across multiple departments and levels of government — Centre, state, and local bodies,” Murthy said, and added that the effectiveness of reforms depends not only on policy intent, but on the coordination among departments, digital system integration, uniformity in implementation, and citizen and business feedback loops.The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs, statistics and industry representatives from CII, FICCI, Assocham, Phdcci and Fisme on auditor’s ongoing pan-India audit of ease of doing business for MSMEs.“We need a four-pronged strategy of simplification, digitalisation, decriminalisation, and elimination of redundant laws — all of which are highly relevant for MSMEs,” he said. The CAG said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.The meeting was part of the auditor’s consultative process for its pan-India horizontal audit on ease of doing business (EoDB) for MSMEs being undertaken.Murthy further said that while the Centre has embarked on a comprehensive initiative to promote EoDB through systematic compliance reduction and deregulation, the real test of reforms lies in the last-mile outcomes. “The audit seeks to assess whether systems are delivering what they ought to,” he said.Murthy said “the MSME sector is not only critical for economic growth, but also for inclusive development, supporting entrepreneurship, strengthening supply chains, and creating livelihoods across rural and urban India”.The pan-India horizontal audit is outcome-oriented public sector auditing, aligned with national priorities and focused on improving service delivery for MSMEs. It will cover the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26, with field audits. The insights from this audit are expected to support governments in refining reforms, reducing compliance burdens and creating a more predictable, transparent and facilitative business environment, enabling MSMEs to focus on productivity, innovation and growth, according to CAG.eom..","Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127783588,imgsize-152276,width-400,resizemode-4/127783588.jpg"
Coking coal notified as 'critical and strategic mineral',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coking-coal-notified-as-critical-and-strategic-mineral/articleshow/127783502.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With demand for imported coking coal—an essential input for the steel industry—continuing to rise despite large domestic reserves, the govt on Thursday notified coking coal as a “critical and strategic mineral” to accelerate exploration and mining activities, including those involving deep-seated deposits.The decision was made on the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, which recognised the strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the needs of domestic steel sector.Officials said India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh also having deposits.Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal increased from 51.2 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.6 million tonnes in 2024–25, meeting about 95% of the steel sector’s requirements.To address this continued dependence on imports, coal (including coking coal) has been included in Part D of the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which lists critical and strategic minerals.The mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and allows the use of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation—measures expected to encourage greater private sector participation.The reform is expected to reduce import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for steel sector and support the objectives of National Steel Policy. It is also likely to promote private investment in exploration and beneficiation, encourage the adoption of advanced mining technologies and generate employment across the mining, logistics and steel value chain.","India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand.

Coal to anchor India’s energy transition amid surging power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coal-to-anchor-indias-energy-transition-amid-surging-power-demand/articleshow/127783430.cms,"'India Turns Green Power Into Growth Story', Pralhad Joshi Tells World Leaders At WEF Davos 2026

NEW DELHI: Coal will continue to play a central role in India’s energy mix as the country works towards tripling its per capita energy consumption over the next 20 years, Union Coal Secretary Vikram Dev Dutt said on Thursday.He was speaking during a panel discussion on the third day of India Energy Week 2026.“Coal is not going away in a hurry. For India, affordable and dependable baseload power is not a choice; it is an imperative. The mantra is not ‘phase out’, it is ‘phase down’ in calibrated steps that reflect ground realities,” he said. Dutt added that coal underpins India’s development needs and will continue to do so even as renewables scale up alongside climate commitments.According to the Economic Survey 2025–26, coal plays an important role in India’s energy landscape, contributing 55% to the national energy mix and fuelling over 74% of total power generation. India’s total installed power generation capacity currently stands at nearly 514 gigawatts (GW), comprising about 247 GW of thermal capacity. Annual per capita energy consumption currently stands at 1,460 kWh and is expected to increase to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kWh by 2047.Highlighting the global perspective, Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary for Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, emphasised that coal remains critical for energy security worldwide.“Coal powered the modern world and it is not going away. Reliable, affordable and secure energy matters, and coal provides that stability, regardless of weather or market volatility,” he said. He highlighted the strong potential for India–US collaboration in clean coal technologies, coal gasification, carbon utilisation, and trade in high-quality metallurgical coal.Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Coal India Limited, B. Sairam, said coal will act as a bridge and enabler in India’s transition. “India’s per capita energy consumption is barely a third of that in developed economies. As this demand triples, coal will provide firm, dispatchable power while renewables and storage mature,” he said.","Coal will continue to play a central role in India’s energy mix.

Centre to test RBI-enabled digital food coupons for free rations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-test-rbi-enabled-digital-food-coupons-for-free-rations/articleshow/127783489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is set to roll out a pilot for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or ‘digital food currency’ under the free ration scheme to a limited number of beneficiaries in Chandigarh, Puducherry and three districts of Gujarat next month. Under this, beneficiaries will receive monthly digital food coupons directly into an RBI-enabled digital wallet on their mobile phones and they will get the entitled free foodgrains from ration shops by simply scanning the shop owners’ QR code to redeem the coupons.This initiative is aimed at bringing greater transparency and plugging any leakage in the world’s largest free food security programme and relieving ration card holders from the hassle of biometric authentication. People aware about the plan said this will be conducted as a Proof of Concept (POC) for the “digital food currency” across three regions and will be at a small-scale to demonstrate the feasibility, functionality, and practical potential of the initiative.Government will also set a timeframe for using the digital coupon to avoid accumulation. Earlier this month, a soft launch was done in Ahmedabad with 25 beneficiaries.A state government official said since then around 2,000 transactions have been completed successfully. The pilot to be rolled out next month will cover Anand, Sabarmati and Dahod.In the case of Chandigarh and Puducherry, Centre had rolled out Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for foodgrains in 2015, which replaced physical foodgrain distribution with direct cash transfers to beneficiaries’ bank accounts. Officials said the digital food currency will ensure that beneficiaries are using the subsidy only for buying foodgrains and for no other purpose.Since there has been no provision of distribution of foodgrains in these two UTs, there are no ration shops. Officials said the authorities are exploring how certain outlets can be identified for distribution of free foodgrain by accepting the digital currency. They added that the free foodgrains which will be distributed through these outlets or ration shops will be supplied by the Food Corporation India (FCI) or state government agencies.Officials said options are also being explored to see that beneficiaries who still use basic or feature phones and hence can’t use the ewallet, can use the digital food food currency.","Government is set to roll out a pilot for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or ‘digital food currency’ under the free ration scheme to a limited number of beneficiaries.

This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, “Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn’t happen. A decision is likely soon on stopping the practice of manually feeding vehicle registration numbers in the system to deduct toll. In such cases, there is a possibility of the toll attendants noting down wrong details. This becomes an unnecessary hassle for commuters.""The ministry claimed that with the implementation of FASTag the average time taken to cross toll plaza has reduced to 40 seconds compared to earlier 12.2 minutes per vehicle under the manual tolling system.In a separate written reply to a question on the total toll collection, the road transport ministry said that in the past three quarters of financial year 2025-26, Rs 50,195 crore was collected as user fee across the NH and expressway network.

NEW DELHI: In an urgent missive to Election Commission, Congress on Thursday accused the ruling BJP of using the EC’s Form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion in the Claim and Objection phase of the SIR in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala.AICC general secretary and MP KC Venugopal, in a complaint to EC, termed the watchdog’s inaction in addressing concerns about systematic subversion of electoral rolls revision as worrisome and urged immediate steps to prevent BJP from misusing the electoral rolls to gain unfair electoral advantage.“These actions, if not taken cognizance of by the Commission, ... will lead to the disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, especially those belonging to the backward, marginalised communities,” he said, adding that backward communities are being targeted by BJP.Venugopal said Form 7 serves a narrow purpose of raising objection to a voter’s name with fact-based reasons like death or duplication, and “is not meant for generalised or speculative objections”. He said the burden of proof too rests on the person filing the Form, with penalties prescribed for making a false submission.Specifying the pattern involved in engineering wrongful deletion, Venugopal said Form 7 is being generated in bulk through a centralised system, which is then being used to raise objections in bulk against targetted categories of electors, including SCs, STs, the minorities and senior citizens.He said these forms are then being handed over to BLOs across multiple constituencies through a well-organised mechanism. The striking feature here is the absence of clear and verifiable particulars of the individual submitting the Form 7, though EC mandates disclosure of an objector’s identity along with documentary material substantiating the objection. He said in many instances, the alleged objectors denied filing the objections.“This casts serious doubts over the sanctity of the entire SIR process being undertaken,” he said.Congress urged EC to institute real-time supervision over the voter deletion process and the monitoring of Form 7 applications, including their issuance and submission. It also sought investigation under Article 324 into misuse of Form 7. Congress further urged EC to release disaggregated data relating to Form-7 applications for all 12 States undergoing SIR.","Congress accuses the ruling BJP of using the EC’s Form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion.

Why does he bring in items from Pakistan, he could have given examples from other places also. There are people in India too. I cannot comment on an example from Pakistan as I have never visited that country.""The Assam CM and the BJP have been attacking Gogoi over his wife's alleged connection with Pakistan's spy agency ISI. They even claim that the Congress leader has ""direct links"" with the neighbouring nation.Talking about the upcoming assembly elections, Sarma said: ""I don't think the opposition or Congress have any stand on any issue. Only one community supports Congress. I don't think the opposition will have any specific impact this time.""""I have so far attended 80 meetings. I can understand the people's pulse. This time, the Congress will have a very bad situation,"" he added.Sarma also criticised leader of the opposition Debabrata Saikia and Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi, and said that they will have no influence during the forthcoming polls.",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday alleged that Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi does not have any responsibility towards the state. Sarma also asserted that the opposition has no stand on any issue ahead of the Assembly elections. Assam assembly elections to 126 constituencies are likely to take place in March-April.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127778401,imgsize-39600,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The victims included Captain Sumit Kapoor, co-pilot Shambhavi Pathak, personal security officer Vidip Jadhav and flight attendant Pinky Mali. Their bodies have been handed over to their families.Police have registered an accidental death report in the case. According to a government statement, the aircraft had gone around due to poor visibility and was later cleared to land, but failed to respond to air traffic control before bursting into flames near the airstrip.Civil aviation minister Rammohan Naidu Kinjarapu on Thursday informed Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has launched a formal probe into the accident. He said the investigation would be carried out transparently and within a stipulated timeframe.","Ajit Pawar was cremated with full state honours at the Vidya Pratishthan college ground.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday refused to walk back from his remarks on ""Miya Muslims"" after the criticism by the opposition.A day after the chief minister said that he encourages troubling the ""Miyan"" to drive them back from the state, Sarma clarified that the word was used to refer the illegal Muslim migrants from Bangladesh. He also cited the Supreme Court to claim that the issue is a ""grave and long-standing problem that Assam has lived with for decades.""In a social media post on X, Sarma said, ""Those who are attacking me for my remarks on “Miyan”—a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration—should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam. This is not my language, not my imagination, and not political exaggeration.""“The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of the geostrategically vital districts of lower Assam… The influx of illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region… It will then only be a matter of time when a demand for their merger with Bangladesh may be made… Loss of lower Assam will sever the entire land mass of the North East from the rest of India and the rich natural resources of that region will be lost to the Nation,"" Himanta cited a Supreme Court observation.""Our effort is not against any religion or any Indian citizen. Our effort is to protect Assam’s identity, security, and future, exactly as the Supreme Court cautioned the nation to do. Ignoring that warning would be the real injustice—to Assam and to India,"" he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Himanta had said that he encourages creating “trouble” for “Miyan Muslims” so that they are driven out of the state, remarks that have sparked widespread outrage across the election-bound northeastern state.“Trouble the Miyan Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam. If I want to give trouble to Miya, I go at 12 am. It’s not an issue. We are directly against the Miya Muslims,"" Himanta had said.""We are not hiding anything; we directly say that we are against Miyans. Earlier, people feared that notices would be served against them. Now, I encourage everyone to give trouble to Miyan. Yesterday, I saw that they have reached Duliajan. A tsunami will happen here, but the result will be in Pakistan,” he added.His remarks drew strong criticism from Opposition leaders, who warned that such statements could have serious consequences for social harmony.Congress leader Udit Raj said the Assam chief minister’s remarks would not go down well with the public and could even lead to “civil war”.“Congress neither works for Bengali Muslims nor for Bengali Hindus. Congress views everyone as a citizen. It is good that what was once done covertly, Himanta Biswa Sarma has now openly stated,' the Congress leader told news agency IANS.CPI(M) MP Amraram also condemned the comments, accusing the Assam government of using administrative exercises to marginalise vulnerable communities.""This is what the chief minister always does. In the name of SIR, votes are being taken away from Dalits, minorities, SCs, and STs. Even when people are not being divided on the basis of Hindu or Muslim, votes are being manipulated in the name of SIR.

NEW DELHI: MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament, with its demand for the rural job scheme’s restoration likely to trigger stormy exchanges in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Opposition INDIA bloc, which held a coordination meeting in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday ahead of the start of the session, also decided to fully participate in the session which includes the Union budget and the Motion of Thanks to the President’s joint address. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is another issue on the opposition’s agenda.In the strategy discussions, attended by Rahul Gandhi, DMK’s TR Baalu, RSP’s NK Premachandran, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant, SP’s Javed Ali Khan, CPM’s John Brittas, CPI’s P Sandosh, Congress’s KC Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh, Manickam Tagore, RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, among others, the leaders decided to mark their protest over the job scheme as President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Wednesday mentioned VB-GRAMG that will replace MGNREGA. TMC did not attend the discussions.When the President’s speech mentioned the VB-GRAMG scheme, opposition MPs stood up and raised slogans. While the action riled the govt into slamming the opposition, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said, “Today during the President’s address, all opposition parties most respectfully and in a dignified manner protested the bulldozed repeal of MGNREGA. The opposition will use all democratic means to demand the restoration of MGNREGA.If the statement made clear the opposition’s intent to make the job scheme the front and centre of its parliamentary agenda, the same scenes may be witnessed during the presentation of the Union budget.The reason behind the focus on MGNREGA seems to be the upcoming five assembly elections and the unanimity among the parties on the issue. The belief among the opposition parties is that the disbanding of the job scheme poses a serious threat to the availability of distress employment for the poor in the future because of the shifting of a considerable financial burden on the states under VB-GRAMG.Since the subject would automatically become part of the discussion on the Union budget and then also figure in debate on the motion of thanks, it would provide ample opportunity to the rivals to amplify concerns and target BJP.However, there is some uncertainty in the INDIA bloc over its decision to focus on MGNREGA and to participate in the session, in view of what TMC may do after it comes to Parliament in the coming days, after the initial absence.

NEW DELHI: DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday, where Congress urged the southern partner to start the already delayed discussions on seat-sharing for the coming Tamil Nadu elections.The visuals of Kanimozhi visiting Rahul settled the uncertainty triggered by public chatter on the alliance. During a meeting this month, the Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had reportedly conveyed to the TN leaders that alliance with DMK was in place and urged them to stop public comments on the issue.According to sources, the talks between Kanimozhi and Rahul were pleasant in which the DMK expressed its respect for Congress. However, Rahul is learnt to have said that the DMK should start talks on seat-sharing with the committee formed by Congress president Kharge.The AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar on Tuesday said he was waiting for the last two months for the DMK to initiate discussions with the Congress panel, an exasperation shared by the party in general.It is learnt that Congress has presented the DMK with a list of 41 seats, but the lead TN partner is reluctant to concede the demand.Congress had sought 41 seats in 2021 polls but was given to contest only 25.While the stress was on initiating the seat-sharing talks, sources said no numbers were discussed between the Gandhi scion and the DMK emissary.Though staunch allies since 2004, the Congress and DMK ties have witnessed rumblings in recent months, with a section of state Congress seeking more seats and a share in future govt. Some have even touted the newbie TVK of movie star Vijay as an option.But DMK is averse to sharing power, having run a single-party govt in the state despite leading a rainbow alliance of multiple outfits.However, the AICC panel is still likely to broach the demand for power-sharing when it discusses seats with the DMK.The TN polls are set to be an exciting contest, with AIADMK, reportedly under pressure from BJP, agreeing to include its breakaway factions in a grand alliance that includes the BJP. The other political pole is TVK that has created a buzz with the star power of Vijay drawing large crowds. While the DMK has been confident of its prospects after its sweep of 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the emergence of TVK has raised concerns in some quarters.","DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh, Dhaka on Wednesday shrugged off New Delhi’s concerns, saying it is their “choice” and “not our concern”. “If they want to take their families back, it is not our concern. There is no security concern. I do not understand what signal is being sent. It is their decision,” Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said.The advisory was issued last week following massive anti-India protests near the Indian high commission in Dhaka and assistant high commissions in other cities — angry protests had come precariously close to the diplomatic facility in Chittagong — as well as a series of attacks on minority Hindus, including killings, since the death of radical Islamist leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, six days after he was shot.“There is no situation in the country that would compel diplomats to send their family members back home or where officials or their family members are in danger,” Touhid said, adding he sees “no justification for the reported non-family posting of Indian diplomats”. He told reporters that the Bangladesh govt has not been informed of any security concerns regarding the family members of Indian diplomats.While the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and its missions have suspended visa operations, the Indian high commission in Dhaka and its missions continue to remain open.","India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh.

HC judges and CJs fearful of SC Collegium

NEW DELHI: In seeking an Allahabad HC judge’s personal explanation, the Supreme Court Collegium appears to have stepped around the mechanism prescribed in memorandum of procedure to deal with errant judges and impermissibly assumed supervisory powers over the High Courts.Was the judge obliged to appear before the Collegium on Tuesday to tender his personal explanation for his controversial speech at a VHP event on Dec 8? TOI spoke to a cross-section of judges in different High Courts who said that he had no option but to appear before the Collegium, which could have taken serious view of his failure to respond to the summons and transferred him to another far-off HC as a punitive measure.Ex-CJIs told TOI that the memorandum of procedure (MoP) specifies that in case of an errant HC judge, the CJI could speak with the concerned HC chief justice and request him to counsel the concerned judge. If the devious behaviour is non-condonable, then the CJI can seek a report from the HC CJ on the matter.Once the CJ, after talking to the judge in question, gives the report, the CJI can seek the opinion of a senior judge outside the Collegium on whether the issue requires an in-house inquiry. Thereafter the CJ’s report and the SC judge’s opinion is placed before the Collegium to take a call on whether an in-house inquiry committee is to be set up.The HC judges were unanimous that though the High Courts are constitutionally distinct and independent entities, the SC Collegium, which has the power to recommend transfer of CH judges and CJs as well as select Judges and CJs for elevation to the SC, has over the years assumed the role of ‘super boss’ in judiciary.The recurring theme of refrain of HC judges was – “power to recommend transfers of HC judges and chief justices has been weaponized to make the HC judges dare not act independent of the views of the CJI-led Collegium. The allurement of getting elevated to the SC, which gives a judge three more years at a more powerful constitutional post, has made the CJs agree to the wishes of the CJI and Collegium.”They said the fact that HCs are not subordinate to the SC has been accepted repeatedly by the SC in its judgments and that is the reason why the SC even on the judicial side cannot direct a HC to decide a case within a specified time frame.The high courts have a pendency of nearly 62 lakh cases with an existing strength of 1114 judges, which works out to 5547 cases per judge. The SC with a working strength of 33 judges has a pendency of over 82,000 cases, working out to 2494 cases per judge. In addition, each HC judge supervises the working of the district courts and guides meaningful work of the district legal services authority.While the HC’s can direct the district judiciary, also referred till recently as subordinate judiciary, the SC cannot do so for the HCs. The HC judges wonder as to whether the SC Collegium could take similar action if the person happens to be a SC judge.Every CJI comes with his own ideas about reforming the justice delivery system, the HC judges said, adding that the CJs of HCs, who are from outside the concerned state, being on the verge of either getting considered for appointment to the SC or retirement, agree unhesitatingly to the CJI’s proposals for reforms without realizing that states with diverse socio-economic conditions need different approach for reducing litigation.","The Supreme Court Collegium appears to have stepped around the mechanism prescribed in memorandum of procedure to deal with errant judges. The High Courts are constitutionally distinct and independent entities.

'Nothing new': Ambedkar's grandson reacts to Amit Shah's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-new-ambedkars-grandson-reacts-to-amit-shahs-remarks/articleshow/116456296.cms,"NEW DELHI: Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson, Prakash Ambedkar , on Wednesday criticised Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution, describing them as reflective of the BJP 's ""same old mentality."" His comments came amidst an ongoing political row, with opposition parties demanding a resignation from Shah, accusing him of insulting BR Ambedkar .Speaking to reporters in Pune, Prakash Ambedkar, who heads the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), alleged that Shah's remarks reveal the BJP's underlying disdain for Ambedkar’s contributions. ""Before the BJP came into existence, its forerunners Jan Sangh and RSS had opposed Babasaheb while the Constitution was being adopted,"" he said. He added, “There is nothing new in the statement. They are not able to execute their old plans. Not because of Congress, but because of Babasaheb Ambedkar and they will continue to sulk.”He also demanded Rs 1 crore compensation for the family of Somnath Suryawanshi, who died in judicial custody following violence in Parbhani city over the desecration of a Constitution replica.The controversy erupted after Shah, during a Rajya Sabha debate, remarked, ""It has become a fashion to repeatedly invoke Ambedkar’s name. If they had taken God’s name as often, they would have earned a place in heaven.""The comments sparked outrage, with several MPs from the INDIA bloc staging protests in Parliament and the Congress demanding a public apology. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh shared a video snippet of Shah's remarks, accusing the BJP of belittling Ambedkar’s legacy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, defended Shah, accusing the Congress of distorting his remarks. Modi claimed Shah’s comments exposed the Congress’ “anti-Ambedkar history,” alleging that the party had previously worked to undermine Ambedkar, including denying him the Bharat Ratna and opposing his electoral bids. ""Congress can try as they want, but people know the truth about their legacy,"" Modi stated.Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, dismissed Modi's defence, accusing the BJP of systematically undermining Ambedkar’s ideology. “They are against the Constitution and Ambedkar’s vision,” Gandhi said, warning that the BJP’s actions are aimed at erasing Ambedkar’s contributions.","Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson criticises Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution.

Watch: The moment Navy speedboat rammed into Mumbai ferry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-the-moment-navy-speed-rammed-into-mumbai-ferry/articleshow/116455616.cms,"NEW DELHI A collision near Mumbai Harbour on Wednesday resulted in the death of 13 people after a Navy speedboat rammed into a passenger ferry, the Neelkamal, causing it to capsize.A viral video captured the moments leading up to the Navy speedboat colliding with a Mumbai ferry. The footage showed the Navy boat racing towards the ferry, attempting a sharp turn before ultimately crashing into it.The incident, occurred around 3:55pm near Butcher Island, left 101 passengers rescued, while several others were hospitalised with injuries. The ferry was en route from the Gateway of India to Elephanta Caves, carrying around 110 passengers, including 20 children.Also read: Man from speedboat flung into air, landed on ferry’s deck The Indian Navy, Coast Guard, and police deployed 11 vessels and four helicopters for the rescue operation. Navy officials confirmed that four of the six crew members aboard the speedboat had died, with one critically injured.Witness accounts from survivors painted a harrowing picture of the chaos that unfolded. Gautam Gupta, 25, who filmed the viral video of the speedboat moments before the crash, told TOI, “I was recording the video of a speedboat presuming it was doing stunts when it suddenly hit our ferry. To my disbelief, one of its passengers was flung into the air and landed on our deck, lifeless and badly mutilated.”Also read: How navy speedboat rammed into Mumbai ferry leaving at least 13 dead Gupta, who is currently undergoing treatment at St George's Hospital alongside his cousin, said their aunt remains missing. “We were on our way to Elephanta Caves when the tragedy struck. There was no guidance from the ferry staff. Everyone scrambled for life jackets on their own,” he added.Ram Milan Singh, 41, a passenger from Bengaluru, described the terrifying moments before the ferry submerged. “Water started rushing in, forcing people to rush to the upper deck. The boat tilted, and many lost their footing. I jumped into the sea, thinking it was my only chance to survive,” he said. Singh and his brother-in-law were rescued, but his two colleagues remain missing.In response to the tragedy, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh for the families of the deceased. “This is a deeply unfortunate incident. A joint investigation by the police and Indian Navy is underway,” he said.President Droupadi Murmu and other leaders, including KC Venugopal and Aaditya Thackeray, expressed condolences and called for thorough rescue efforts.An FIR has been filed at Colaba police station in south Mumbai under relevant sections of the new BNS criminal code against the Navy speedboat driver and others responsible for the tragedy, an official confirmed. The charges include causing death by negligence, endangering safety, reckless navigation, and mischief causing wrongful harm.This marks the second Navy-related accident in less than a month, following the November 21 collision of INS Karanj with the fishing vessel FV Marthoma, which resulted in two fatalities, as per PTI.","A viral video captured the moments leading up to the Navy speedboat colliding with a Mumbai ferry.

ABU DHABI: Indian art has taken centre stage at Louvre Abu Dhabi , the Arab world's largest art museum, with highlights such as a Chola-era bronze idol of Jina and Sayed Haider Raza 's Bindu. Since its opening in 2017, the museum has showcased how trade and artistic exchanges connected India with the rest of the world.Ann Sasidharan, operations team leader at the museum, said India's influence spans centuries. ""During the 1500s, trade routes through India shaped global navigation and art. Even under East India Company rule, Indian artists preserved their originality,"" she told TOI.She said the collection illustrates India's role in the diffusion of religious art, particularly between 5th and 15th centuries. Sculptures like Buddha heads from Kushan Empire (100-300 CE), which included parts of present-day Pakistan, and copper tribhanga Buddhas from Malla dynasty, present-day Nepal, sit alongside Chinese depictions of Guanyin from Northern Song Dynasty, highlighting a shared spiritual heritage.With over 1,000 artworks from across the globe, Louvre Abu Dhabi attracted 1.2 million visitors in 2023, and Indians were among the top three international audiences. The museum's focus on cross-cultural understanding is also bringing contemporary Indian culture into the spotlight, exemplified by last year's exhibition 'Bollywood Superstars: A Short Story of Indian Cinema'.","Louvre Abu Dhabi is the Arab world's largest art museum.

"6 months later, smooth ride for NDA, INDIA bloc in disarray",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-months-later-smooth-ride-for-nda-india-bloc-in-disarray/articleshow/116453655.cms,"NEW DELHI: Six months is a long time in politics, and it is evident during the current session of Parliament.While the INDIA bloc was mounting pressure on the BJP-headed govt in June after the saffron party bagged 240 seats and fell short of securing majority on its own, during the winter session it is seen to be in disarray over multiple issues, from EVMs to Adani and V D Savarkar.In contrast, the coordination among NDA partners has appeared rather smooth, particularly during the debate on Constitution with each ally, whether it is BJP or Shiv Sena (Shinde), acting in sync. Even on the one nation one election (ONOE) bills, BJP managed to get TDP to back the move, with Chandrababu Naidu arguing that it will not impact Andhra Pradesh, which has been having simultaneous LS and assembly elections since 2004. TDP and JD(U), both with Muslim constituents, have resisted taking the bait from ""secular"" parties to oppose the legislation.The strong chemistry may have to do with the improved arithmetic in states after BJP's emphatic victories in Haryana and Maharashtra.The poll setbacks seem to have severely hit Congress , which was celebrating its 99 seats in Lok Sabha, the best show in a decade, undermining its credentials to head an anti-BJP front: its sheet anchor, at minimum. After its loss in the two elections and underwhelming show in J&K and Jharkhand, allies are seeking to reframe the power equations, with TMC boss Mamata Banerjee stepping up to grab the mantle and,getting the support of satraps such as Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad to head the bloc. Samajwadi Party too flexed its muscles in UP by-polls and has now decided to support Arvind Kejriwal, who is being challenged by Congress. Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday demanded Bharat Ratna for Hindutva ideologue and freedom fighter Savarkar. The effort to reclaim his Hindutva credentials is diametrically opposite to Rahul Gandhi's consistent campaign against Savarkar.The next challenge will be the polls for the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation where Uddhav and Rahul may struggle to reconcile their differences over a range of issues - from Savarkar to Ram Congresss's reaction to criticism of the restive allies: lashing out at Omar Abdullah or mocking Mamata's ambition as a cruel joke, has not helped matters. Congress has found itself at odds with allies on issues such as the Adani controversy, with TMC and SP breaking ranks with it.","The coordination among NDA partners has appeared rather smooth, particularly during the debate on Constitution.

PRAYAGRAJ: Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri , the head of Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, lauded chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday for his exemplary leadership, calling him the ‘Sun of Sanatan'.He emphasised that under Yogi's guidance, remarkable standards are being set, advancing the cause of Sanatan Dharma as never before.Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership. He also lauded PM Narendra Modi's vision of making Maha Kumbh a ""Mahayagya of Unity."" He called for collective efforts to make the event clean, healthy, green, digital, and plastic-free.He emphasized the need for participation from every village across the country, alongside local administration, voluntary organisations, and pilgrims, to ensure the success of Maha Kumbh through cleanliness drives and charitable activities.Highlighting the identity Maha Kumbh gained in 2019, he expressed confidence that the 2025 edition would set new benchmarks. He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: 'India's greatest fast bowler...': Aussies in awe of Jasprit Bumrah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/indias-greatest-fast-bowler-aussies-in-awe-of-jasprit-bumrah/articleshow/116456214.cms,"We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: India's Jasprit Bumrah is considered one of cricket's best fast bowlers because of his ""slingshot"" delivery and capacity to disturb the best batters in the world.Overcoming career-threatening back issues, the 31-year-old became India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia on Wednesday, surpassing the great Kapil Dev In the third Test in Brisbane, Bumrah, who has been India's player of the series thus far, grabbed nine wickets to surpass Dev's previous record of 51 and reach 53 in Australia.Before the hosts tied the series in Adelaide, he was the player of the match in India's 295-run triumph in Perth in the first Test.With 21 wickets in the series thus far at an almost unbelievable average of 10.90, he is the most prolific bowler on both sides. With 14 dismissals apiece, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc are next in line.""I think he is definitely India's greatest fast bowler,"" former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said of Bumrah.""In T20 cricket, one-day cricket and Test match cricket, he's clearly the best right now.""Travis Head, who has scored two hundreds and a fifty for Australia in the five-match series, went even farther.""Jasprit is probably going to go down as one of the greatest fast bowlers to play the game,"" said Head.On a bouncing Perth wicket, Bumrah, who was captaining the first Test in the absence of Rohit Sharma , made life miserable for the Australian batters.The hosts were dismissed for 104 after he took 5-30 from 18 overs. In the second innings, he added 3-42 to help India win by 295 runs.He can bowl yorkers whenever he wants and can release the ball late thanks to his unconventional front-on motion.Australia pacer Josh Hazlewood was astounded by Bumrah's unique approach, which he developed as a child while practicing in a little parking lot close to his family's Ahmedabad flat.""If you haven't faced him before, it can really unsettle you,"" Hazlewood said.""He lets the ball go way out in front, so he's pretty much half a yard quicker than what the actual speed gun says.""He's like a slingshot loading up and letting go.""Bumrah's match haul in Perth had some pundits questioning the legality of his deliveries, which appear to be bowled with a bent elbow.Australian great and former India coach Greg Chappell soon jumped to Bumrah's defence, describing the debate as ""nonsense"" and deeming Bumrah's action ""unequivocally clean"".After suffering a severe back injury that prevented him from playing in 2022 and 2023, Bumrah returned to the Indian squad last year.His contribution to India's June T20 World Cup victory in Barbados was crucial, as Rohit called his effort a ""masterclass"" for stopping South Africa from winning the final with 30 runs off the final 30 balls.His Indian Premier League team, the Mumbai Indians , where he has played for over ten years, is where the seeds of his brilliance were planted.When the Indians won the first of their five IPL titles in 2013, the pace bowler was recruited to Mumbai by former New Zealand batsman John Wright , who had scouted him from his native Gujarat.In his first game, Bumrah made an immediate impression by removing Virat Kohli , the standout batter for RCB.Head, who fell to Bumrah in Perth's second innings, claimed he enjoyed attempting to unravel the mystery of the mysterious bowler.""It's going to be nice to look back at your career and tell the grandkids that you faced him,"" he said.","Jasprit Bumrah becomes India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia, surpassing Kapil Dev. The 31-year-old has been India's player of the series in the five- match series.

Bengaluru Techie Suicide: Estranged wife Nikita Singhania's uncle Sushil gets bail from Allahabad high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-uncle-of-bluru-techies-wife/articleshow/116379516.cms,"PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Monday granted (transit) anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania , the uncle of the widow of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, in connection with the abetment to suicide case.Atul Subhash had committed suicide in Bengaluru leaving a suicide note alleging continuous harassment by her Jaunpur-based wife. The order was passed by Justice Ashutosh Srivastava.Earlier, appearing for Sushil, the counsel for the applicant questioned the authenticity of the suicide note left by Atul Subhash. He also added that the family court judge, before whom the matter of Atul Subhash and his wife Nikita Singhania was pending, was 'spared' despite being named in the suicide note.In response to this, the government's advocate submitted that the high court had on the administrative side taken note of the matter and it had summoned case records.Before the court, the accused limited the relief to a grant of transit anticipatory bail until January 2, the day when the courts in Karnataka will reopen after the winter break. The single judge is likely to pass an order later.On the other hand, the counsel appearing for the complainant argued that there is a specific allegation against the uncle (applicant-accused), as the alleged suicide video says that he was harassing the deceased for extorting money.","The Allahabad high court granted (transit) anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of the widow of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash.

NEW DELHI: Hours after invoking GRAP-III in Delhi-NCR as the capital’s AQI deteriorated to higher end of ‘very poor’, the Commission for Air Quality Management enforced the highest level of curbs ( GRAP-IV ) in the region soon after air quality had crossed into the ‘severe’ zone at 10pm.Previous implementations of GRAP Stage-I and modified Stage-II continue to remain active. Earlier, GRAP Stage-III was operational from November 15 to December 4, while Stage-IV was enforced from November 18 to December 4.Under the revised GRAP, stricter measures have been introduced to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Schools and colleges in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad , and Gautam Budh Nagar will shift to hybrid classes for students up to Class V, allowing parents and students to opt for online learning where available.This winter, it is the second time when GRAP IV was enforced. Stage III and IV restrictions were enforced on Nov 15 and 18, respectively.These restrictions were revoked on Dec 5 with immediate effect, following Supreme Court’s permission.However, the Supreme Court had said GRAP Stage-III should be imposed next time when the AQI crosses 350, as against the earlier threshold of 400.It had similarly asked Stage IV to be imposed when the AQI touches 400, as opposed to the earlier threshold of 450.","Under the revised GRAP, stricter measures have been introduced to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

6-point consensus



Positively evaluated the resolution in eastern Ladakh and agreed to work for peace on the ground.

Commitment for a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable package solution to the border issue.

Strengthen confidence-building measures.

Resume Kailash yatra, river cooperation and border trade.

Strengthen SR, diplomatic and military talks mechanisms.

SRs to meet again in India in 2025.

NEW DELHI: India and China took a significant step forward towards further normalization of ties as the Special Representatives (SRs), NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi, held talks for the first time under that format in 5 years in Beijing and, according to an Indian readout, positively affirmed the implementation of the October 21 disengagement agreement , resulting in patrolling and grazing in “relevant areas”.Significantly, they discussed ways to ensure peace on the ground so that border issues don’t hold back “normal development’’ of bilateral relations and, according to Beijing, agreed on a “step by step” roadmap, which would entail addressing the easy issues first before moving on to those more contentious, for taking the relationship forward.Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong said the 2 sides reached a 6-point consensus that included resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in Xizang (Tibet), cross-border river cooperation and trade at the Nathu La Pass.China described the “hard-won” talks as constructive, with Wang saying the SR engagement was an important and timely step towards the implementation of the consensus reached by PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October.The Indian government said Doval and Wang also provided “positive directions” for cross-border cooperation and exchanges including resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , data sharing on trans-border rivers and border trade.The Indian government said Wang and Doval reiterated the importance of maintaining a “political perspective” of the overall bilateral relationship, while seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for settlement of the boundary question. They resolved to inject more “vitality” into this process. “They agreed on the salience of stable, predictable and amicable India-China relations for regional and global peace and prosperity,’’ said the government.Doval and Wang also underlined the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas to promote overall development of the India-China bilateral relationship, according to the Indian side.The SR engagement, which last took place in December 2019, followed the October thaw that saw India and China completing the disengagement process at the remaining friction points, Depsang and Demchok, in eastern Ladakh. This was also the first high-level visit from India to China since the eastern Ladakh border standoff that started in May 2020.“Drawing on the learnings from the events of 2020, they discussed various measures to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border and advance effective border management . They decided to use, coordinate and guide the relevant diplomatic and military mechanisms towards this purpose,’’ said the Indian readout. India has said that after disengagement, it’s going to focus on de-escalation and effective management of border activities.Doval also called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and invited Wang to India for another round of SR talks.","India and China took a significant step forward towards further normalization of ties as the Special Representatives (SRs), NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi, held talks for the first time in 5 years in Beijing.

Is coconut oil hair oil or edible oil? Supreme Court solves old puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-coconut-oil-hair-oil-or-edible-oil-supreme-court-solves-old-puzzle/articleshow/116449605.cms,"To oil or boil?

NEW DELHI: A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty - whether pure coconut oil is to be classified as an edible oil or under cosmetics as hair oil?This question had got a split verdict from the bench of the then CJI and Justice R Banumathi. While Justice Gogoi, who retired as CJI in Nov 2019, was of the view coconut oil in small packaging was appropriately classified as edible oil, Justice Banumathi opined that coconut oil packed in small containers are to be classified as hair oil.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan, aware of the dual use of coconut oil in different parts of the country, said the classification would depend on the branding of the oil as edible to meet the criteria under food safety regulations, and conform to a different criterion under Drugs and Cosmetics Act to be classified as hair oil.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar rejected argument of revenue dept that pure coconut oil should invariably be classified as hair oil and said, ""We are of the opinion that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable as edible oil"". Revenue dept had said the bunch of appeals involved Rs 160 crore in terms of excise duty, penalties, redemption fine and interest.SC said, ""The fact that such edible coconut oil was sold in smaller containers would not, by itself, be indicative of it being packaging of a kind fit for use as 'hair oil'.""""One may choose to buy one's cooking oil in small quantities, be it for economic or for health reasons or due to inclination to use fresh oil in food preparation, and the smaller size of the packaging of such oil cannot be taken to mean that it is to be used as 'hair oil' without any pointer to that effect, be it by way of a label or literature or by any other indication that it is to be used as 'hair oil',"" it said.""Small-sized containers are common to both 'edible oils' and 'hair oils'. Therefore, there must be something more to distinguish between them for classification of such oil, other than size of the packaging,"" the bench said.","A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty.

BJP MLC Ram Shinde’s filing of nomination is being seen as a setback for Shinde-led Sena, which was seeking the legislative council chairperson’s post. (PTI)

NAGPUR: BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday. While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Ajit Pawar accompanied Ram Shinde, deputy CM Eknath Shinde didn't join them.Ram's nomination is being seen as a setback for Shiv Sena led by Eknath, which was seeking the council chairperson's post. Sena's Neelam Gorhe, who is currently deputy chairperson, was said to be in the race.Ram said, "" Congress also said that it will not be filing any nominations, so this election will be unopposed. That has sent a good message. I thank CM Fadnavis and the deputy CMs. Some discussion could have happened at the senior level between BJP and Sena.""Elections to the prestigious post were not held as Shiv Sena and NCP were split in 2022 and 2023 respectively. BJP has a majority in the council, but Sena was keen to get the post since BJP has the speaker's post in the legislative assembly. Now BJP will have presiding officers in both Houses of the legislature.Party sources said BJP has picked Ram for the post as he is from the Dhangar community. He was MLA from Karjat-Jamkhed but was defeated by NCP's (SP) Rohit Pawar in 2019 and in 2024.In July, Maha Vikas Aghadi's MLAs and MLCs led by leader of opposition in the legislative council Ambadas Danve had met then governor Ramesh Bais and urged him to direct that the election to the council's chairperson be held during the monsoon session. However, the election was not held then.A BJP functionary said, ""Ram lost the assembly polls in 2019 and was made an MLC, but he also lost the 2024 assembly polls. However, so far neither he nor MLA Gopichand Padalkar, who is also from the Dhangar community, have been made ministers in the new govt. So the party is nominating Ram for the chairperson's post. BJP is the largest party in the council and Ram's election will be easy and most likely unopposed.""","BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday.

Passenger on ferry recounts horror

NEW DELHI: 13 people died, 101 others were rescued after a ferry capsized while en route to Elephanta Island from Mumbai’s iconic Gateway of India, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis informed on Wednesday.The Neelkamal ferry, was on way to Elephanta Islands, a popular tourist destination near Mumbai, when the speed boat circled it before crashing into it.The incident happened when a naval speed-craft undergoing trials in the sea went out of control and rammed into the ferry. The naval boat’s engine had been recently changed and the new engine was being tested. The engine got stuck in full throttle and the boat went out of control and rammed into the ferry Neelkamal. The naval boat had 6 persons on board including 2 naval personnel and 4 members from the firm which had supplied the engine.According to the reports, the ferry had over 110 people on board including 20 children while the naval boat had six individuals, including two Navy personnel and four staff members.Rescue efforts were launched in coordination between the Indian Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Police. The operation involves 11 Navy boats, three Marine Police boats, and one Coast Guard vessel actively searching the area. Additionally, four helicopters have been deployed for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations to locate any remaining passengers.Fadnavis said that the ferry capsized after a speed boat, reportedly belonging to either the Navy or the Coast Guard, lost control and collided with it.Fadnavis declared financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of victims of the ""extremely unfortunate"" tragedy from the CM's Relief Fund. PM Modi too declared Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia for the kin of victims of the tragedy.CISF jawans rescued 56 individuals after a ferry collided with a Navy craft off the Mumbai coast on Wednesday. The CISF said that its personnel reached the accident site, near Butcher Island—approximately 6 km from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPA)—using a patrolling boat.The CISF’s patrolling boat and the pilot boat SHM-XXIII rescued 56 individuals, who were then transported to the JNPA landing jetty.Despite the accident site being beyond JNPA’s regular patrolling limits, CISF boats were immediately dispatched upon receiving information from Port Control. “All possible assistance was provided at the JNPA landing jetty to ensure the safe transfer of passengers needing medical care to JNPA Hospital,” the CISF statement added.When 45-year-old Ganesh spotted a speedboat-like craft rushing toward the ferry he was standing on, a chilling thought crossed his mind: the inevitable was about to happen—and it did.“The boat, which later turned out to be a naval craft, was moving in circles in the Arabian Sea, while our ferry was on its way to Elephanta Island, a popular tourist attraction near Mumbai. I had boarded the ferry around 3:30 pm,” Ganesh told PTI.“There was a brief thought in my mind that the naval craft could hit our boat, and it happened within the next few seconds,” said Ganesh, who was standing on the deck of the ill-fated Neel Kamal ferry.The eyewitness, a Hyderabad native, was among the first of the 99 passengers rescued after the collision. He noted that there were over 100 passengers, including children, on board the ferry at the time of the accident.","13 people died, 101 others were rescued after a ferry capsized while en route to Elephanta Island from Mumbai’s iconic Gateway of India.

AAP promise: Free medical treatment for 60+ in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-promise-free-medical-treatment-for-60-in-delhi/articleshow/116450796.cms,"Valid voter I-card of Delhi sole criterion: Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Eyeing the upcoming assembly polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal promised to provide free treatment to all Delhiites aged above 60 years at both state-run and private health facilities if re-elected in polls due in Feb next year.Announcing the proposed 'Sanjeevani' scheme, Kejriwal said AAP volunteers would start visiting every household within two-three weeks to complete the ""registration"" and provide every eligible person with a card. ""Keep the card issued by AAP volunteers safe. The scheme will be approved as soon as AAP forms the govt after the elections,"" Kejriwal said.Sources said the scheme was announced as a counter to the Centre's Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana, which was expanded in Sept this year to cover all senior citizens aged 70 and above.The AB PM-JAY provides free health insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh, regardless of the beneficiary's income. Delhi and West Bengal are the only two states in the country that have not implemented the AB PM-JAY scheme so far.After the Delhi HC issued a notice to the Delhi govt regarding implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme last month, CM Atishi said that her govt was ready to implement it, but there were contradictions between the facilities offered by the GNCTD and those under Ayushman Bharat. She added that the health department was directed to devise a mechanism to incorporate the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat scheme without withdrawing the benefits of the Delhi govt's free healthcare facilities for the people.Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said the biggest issue that troubles every elderly person as they age is the rising cost of treatment. He added that there would be no other criteria to be eligible for the Sanjeevani scheme except a valid voter I-card of Delhi. ""Whether you wish to get treated in a govt hospital or a private hospital, the entire cost of your treatment will be covered by the Delhi govt,"" Kejriwal announced. ""There will be no restrictions based on income. Everyone's treatment, whether rich or poor, will be provided free of cost. There will be no upper limit on the expenses,"" he said.AAP, in a statement, said that over 25 lakh senior citizens were likely to benefit from the scheme, which will not have any income or socio-economic restrictions, and health cards would be issued without any discrimination. When asked, govt sources said no calculations of the estimated expenditure on the scheme were done so far. ""A proper policy will be made, and the modalities will be worked out in due course of time,"" said a source.Highlighting the success of the free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens, under which nearly one lakh senior citizens so far undertook pilgrimages to various parts of the country, Kejriwal said it was his ""responsibility"" to ensure the good health of every elder in Delhi. ""Your son will take full responsibility for keeping you healthy in your old age. In return, I only ask for your blessings,"" Kejriwal said.The announcement made by the former Delhi CM was applauded by his party colleagues on X. CM Atishi said, ""A son should be like Arvind Kejriwal."" ""First, he became a Shravan Kumar for Delhi by arranging pilgrimages for over 1 lakh elders, and now he has introduced the Sanjeevani scheme for their well-being... Registration for this scheme will begin shortly, and its implementation will commence after the elections,"" Atishi posted on X.Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia also posted similar messages.","AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal promises to provide free treatment to all Delhiites aged above 60 years at both state-run and private health facilities.

Uproar over Ambedkar stalls both Houses, TMC moves privilege notice against Shah

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Wednesday opened a new front against the Centre over home minister Amit Shah's alleged insult of B R Ambedkar. It held noisy protests in Parliament, leading to both Houses being adjourned and drawing a sharp retaliation from govt MPs.Leading the counter-offensive, PM Modi dismissed opposition's demand for Shah's resignation as ""theatrics"" and asserted that the rival party and its ""rotten ecosystem"" were spreading ""falsehoods"" because the home minister had exposed its misdeeds towards the Dalit icon. Shah accused Congress of circulating a ""doctored"" version of his Rajya Sabha speech and said BJP was exploring all legal options in response. ""The party is serious about it,"" he said at a press conference, emphasising that he belonged to a party which would never insult Ambedkar.Shah also reminded everyone that Ambedkar had to quit the first cabinet led by J L Nehru due to his disagreement with then Cong-led govt's policies, including Art 370. Shah also said most of the memorials of Ambedkar were built when BJP came to office. However, opposition's attack on Shah remained unrelenting with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge saying it was India's misfortune that a Dalit icon was mocked by the HM. The intent to target Shah & BJP was evident when TMC's Derek O'Brien filed a privilege notice against him in RS.Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned without transacting any business on Wednesday due to noisy protests with Congress members seeking an apology from home minister Amit Shah for allegedly making disparaging remarks against B R Ambedkar.In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien submitted a privilege notice against Shah under Rule 187.The notice quoted the home minister's statement in the Upper House on Tuesday during his reply to a debate on 75 years of the Constitution. TMC also demanded an unconditional apology from Shah in Parliament.As soon as Lok Sabha proceedings began, Congress members Manickam Tagore and Hibi Eden led the sloganeering over Shah's remarks and trooped into the well, displaying posters of Ambedkar and raising slogans of 'Jai Bhim'. When BJP members opened the House post-adjournment with chants of 'Jai Shri Ram', the opposition replied in unison with ""Jai Bhim"". Members of opposition parties stood at their seats in support of Congress. Some members of the INDIA bloc were also in the well. Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was present in the House along with his sibling and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal sought to counter Congress, saying the party had always insulted Ambedkar and ensured his defeat in a Lok Sabha election. It resulted in further sloganeering.In Rajya Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju and leader of the House J P Nadda strongly defended Shah's references to Ambedkar after leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge sought an apology from the home minister for ""insulting"" the Dalit icon.They said the remarks were being projected by Congress in a distorted way and were clearly ""an expression of our sense of reverence"" for Ambedkar. Rijiju and Nadda not only rubbished the opposition's ""insult"" charge, but also accused Congress of having insulted Ambedkar both in his lifetime and after.Responding to noisy protests in the morning, Rijiju said Congress had not bothered to honour Ambedkar with the Bharat Ratna, which was conferred on him in 1990 by a BJP-backed govt.""In 1952, Congress worked to ensure his defeat in Lok Sabha election; not only this, it was also responsible for Ambedkar's defeat in a Vidharbha bypoll later,"" he said. ""Baba Saheb (Ambedkar) would have been a member of Parliament (after 1952). By defeating him twice, you deceived the nation. You are pretending to speak up for Baba Saheb, but only using his name for political and electoral gains,"" Rijiju said.

From clamping of Emergency to using Constitution to reverse Supreme Court's Shah Bano judgment, all such past instances under the Congress regime were highlighted to target the grand-old-party and its leaders.However, a day after the end of debate, it was the turn of the Congress and other opposition parties to corner the BJP using Amit Shah's reference to B R Ambedkar.Congress general secretary-in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh shared a video snippet on X from Amit Shah's speech in the Upper House in which the Union home minister, taking a swipe at the opposition, had said: ""Abhi ek fashion ho gaya hai - Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar. Itna naam agar bhagwan ka lete to saat janmon tak swarg mil jata (It has become a fashion to say Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar'. If they had taken God's name so many times, they would have got a place in heaven).""The opposition was quick to latch on to the short clip and stalled Rajya Sabha proceedings demanding an apology from Amit Shah. They claimed his remarks were an ""insult"" to the architect of India's Constitution B R Ambedkar. MPs of the opposition's INDIA bloc staged a protest outside Parliament demanding an apology from Amit Shah.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge lashed out at Shah and said the “insult” of Babasaheb by the home minister “has once again proven that the BJP-RSS were against the tricolour, their forefathers opposed the Ashok Chakra and the people of the Sangh Parivar wanted to implement Manusmriti instead of the Constitution of India from the very first day”.""Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar Ji did not allow this to happen, that is why there is so much hatred towards him,” Kharge said.""The ministers of the Modi government should understand carefully that for crores of people like me, Babasaheb Ambedkar is no less than God... He is and will always be the messiah of Dalits, tribals, backward classes, minorities and the poor,” Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.The BJP's defence of Amit Shah was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Prime Minister hit out at the Congress, saying its ""rotten ecosystem"" and ""malicious lies"" cannot hide its misdeeds and said the home minister had exposed the opposition party's ""dark history of insulting"" Ambedkar.Amit Shah also addressed a press conference and alleged that the Congress in the past has also misrepresented his and even PM Narendra Modi's comments to spread confusion and mislead people.""I condemn the Congress for twisting facts. Why did it happen? It happened because BJP leaders spoke on how the NDA governments upheld the Constitution and established with facts that the Congress is anti-Ambedkar, anti-Constitution and anti-reservation,"" Shah told reporters.""When all these facts came out, the Congress used its old tricks and made an effort to mislead the society by presenting twisted facts,"" Shah said, adding that he comes from a party that will never insult Ambedkar.Meanwhile, the uproar in Parliament also spilt onto the streets of the national capital and other states like Maharashtra, Bihar and Tamil Nadu where various parties held protests.In Delhi, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal led a protest with hundreds of supporters outside the BJP chanting slogans of ""Amit Shah maafi maango, Amit Shah sharm karo"".In Mumbai, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray said, ""Amit Shah's remarks on Dr Ambedkar show the party's (BJP's) arrogance and have exposed its true face.""""Prime Minister Modi should act against Amit Shah for his remarks on Dr Ambedkar and he should quit if he is not able to do so,"" the former chief minister said.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that Union Home Minister's remarks about Ambedkar were a display of the BJP's ""casteist and anti-Dalit mindset"".""The mask has fallen! As Parliament reflects on 75 glorious years of the Constitution, HM @AmitShah chose to TARNISH this occasion with DEROGATORY remarks against Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, that too in the temple of Democracy,"" she posted on X.""This is a display of BJP's CASTEIST and ANTI-DALIT mindset. If this is how they behave after being reduced to 240 seats, imagine the damage they would've inflicted if their dream of 400 seats had been realised. They'd have rewritten history to entirely erase Dr. Ambedkar's contributions,"" she alleged.M K Stalin, the Tamil Nadu chief minister, said, ""Only those who commit more sins should be concerned about 'punya' (Good deeds). Those who are concerned about the country, its people and the protection of the Constitution will only utter the name of Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar and they will have to utter only his name.""""BJP leaders should hear this loud and clear, Babasaheb Ambedkar is our fashion, passion, inspiration and motivation as well,"" RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav said.Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said they respected BR Ambedkar for his contribution to the framing of the Constitution.""You all should see what kind of language has been used by him in the Parliament'¦ This is the situation in Delhi. In UP, the kind of language our CM (Yogi Adityanath) uses in the House is not democratic.

He contends he is due relief.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament on Tuesday that the banks had recovered Rs 14,131.60 crore from Mallya. This recovery stems from the Kingfisher Airlines debt, which a tribunal assessed at Rs 6,203 crore.In a series of tweets, Mallya wrote on X, ""The Debt Recovery Tribunal adjudged the KFA (Kingfisher Airlines) debt at Rs 6203 crores including Rs 1200 crores of interest. The FM announced in Parliament that through the ED, Banks have recovered Rs 14,131.60 crores from me against the judgement debt of Rs 6203 crores and I am still an economic offender . Unless the ED and Banks can legally justify how they have taken more than two times the debt, I am entitled to relief which I will pursue.""""Whatever I have stated about my liabilities as guarantor of KFA loans is legally verifiable. Yet more than Rs 8000 crores have been recovered from me over and above the judgement debt. Will anyone, including those who freely abuse me, stand up and question this blatant injustice ? To be seen to support a much maligned me requires guts. Sadly no guts for justice particularly for me,"" he tweeted.In another tweet, Mallya said, ""Government and my many critics say that I have CBI criminal cases to answer. What criminal cases filed by CBI ? Never borrowed a single rupee, never stole, but as guarantor of KFA debt I am accused by CBI together with many others including IDBI Bank officials of fraudulently obtaining a Rs 900 crore loan from IDBI Bank duly approved by their credit committee and Board. Full loan and interest repaid. After 9 years why no conclusive evidence of fraud and misuse of funds ?""Sitharaman detailed several cases where the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has recovered assets linked to economic offenses. These include cases involving Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, and the National Spot Exchange Ltd scam. She stated the government is pursuing those who have committed economic offenses.Sitharaman also addressed recent GDP growth figures, calling the slower second-quarter growth a 'temporary blip.'","Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya says banks have recovered more than double the amount owed in the Kingfisher Airlines case.

"Cleared of Pakistan spy charge, man is set to be UP judge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cleared-of-pakistan-spy-charge-man-is-set-to-be-up-judge/articleshow/116451749.cms,"Pradeep Kumar.

KANPUR: In a cul-de-sac of Kanpur's Rajendra Mohal stands a small jewellery workshop where a man in his 60s is busy putting a batch of gold samples through chemical tests to ascertain their purity. One of the walls bears a framed photograph of the shop owner's late father Jagdish Prasad, who was an additional district judge in UP.Jagdish Prasad's six children studied law, but only one of them - Pradeep Kumar - completed his LLB.Standing outside his workshop, Sanjay Kumar talks about his 49-year-old law graduate brother with a sense of pride and joy that is tempered by the thought of what he and the family have been through over the past two decades.Pradeep passed the judicial equivalent of the purity test recently when Allahabad HC ""honourably acquitted"" him of the charge of spying for Pakistan.The acquittal paved the way for his appointment as an additional district judge in UP by Jan 15, bringing to a close an ordeal that started in 2002.""We endured a tough time, but justice has prevailed. He (Pradeep) never gave up hope. The stain on our family has been cleansed. I wish our father were alive to witness his youngest son fulfilling his dream of becoming a judge,"" said Sanjay, the second of the six siblings.Sanjay's grandfather, Sukhdev Ram, had moved to Kanpur's Kotwali neighbourhood to master the craft of carving gold, but the latter's son, Jagdish, chose to pursue an LLB degree.After practising law for a decade, he cleared the UP judicial exam to become a judge. Jagdish served in several districts, including Deoria and Hamirpur.""Pradeep was as determined as our father to become a judge. Who could have imagined he would be framed in an espionage case that would stall his career before it could take off? But he never gave up,"" Sanjay said.In June 2002, Pradeep was an unemployed law graduate when a special police taskforce and Military Intelligence arrested him on suspicion of spying for Pakistan and charged him with sedition, criminal conspiracy and violating Official Secrets Act.He was accused of passing sensitive information, such as the names of Army units and officers of Kanpur Cantonment, to a person identified as Faizan Illahi, who used to run a photocopy shop, in exchange for Rs 18,000. During the lengthy trial, neither Military Intelligence nor the police could establish the charges.After being acquitted by a district court in Kanpur in 2014, Pradeep cleared the UP PCS (J) exam in 2016-17, ranking 27th on the merit list. ""But his candidature was presumably rejected because he had been accused of spying. We suspect a neighbour of ours framed him,"" said Sanjay.The HC acquittal came on Dec 6, after which Pradeep left UP with his wife and their four-year-old daughter.Allahabad HC has fined state govt Rs 10 lakh for ""indifferent attitude"" and ""tardiness"" in acting on its recommendation regarding Pradeep's appointment in 2017.","Pradeep Kumar was an unemployed law graduate when a special police taskforce and Military Intelligence arrested him on suspicion of spying for Pakistan.

Injustice by HC against sessions judge, says SC, erases adverse remarks

NEW DELHI: Giving trial courts full discretionary freedom in formulating their decisions in bail matters, Supreme Court has ruled that no constitutional court, be it SC or HC, can dictate a format for grant of bail to accused to be mandatorily followed by judicial officers.The court quashed proceedings initiated by Rajasthan high court against district and sessions judge Ayub Khan for not sticking to the format devised by it that mandated specifying the criminal antecedents of the accused in a tabular form while granting bail.The bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih also expunged all adverse remarks against Khan and said injustice had been done to him by HC as ""non-compliance of the format stipulated by HC cannot be treated as an act of indiscipline or contempt"".Writing the judgment, Justice Oka said, ""No constitutional court can direct trial courts to write orders on bail applications in a particular manner. One judge of a constitutional court may be of the view that trial courts should use a particular format. The other judge may be of the view that another format is better.""Appearing for Khan, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra told the bench that HC was rather harsh in its judgment to indict the judicial officer despite his explanation that though he had referred to criminal antecedents of the accused, he had missed out tabulating them because of excessive work pressure. Trial courts are groaning under a monstrous pendency of over 4.6 crore cases.Frowning at HC for terming this lapse as an instance of serious judicial indiscipline and referring the matter to HC chief justice for necessary action, SC said it was inappropriate on the part of HC to seek explanation from a judicial officer through a judicial order.The bench said, ""With the utmost respect to HC, undertaking such an exercise was a waste of precious judicial time of HC which has a huge pendency."" HCs are facing a pendency of 62 lakh cases. ""We clarify that in view of what we have held earlier, the adverse remarks and observations made against the appellant in the aforesaid orders cannot be the basis for taking any action against the appellant on the administrative side,"" it said.",Supreme Court quashes proceedings initiated by Rajasthan high court against district and sessions judge Ayub Khan for not sticking to the format devised by it. The bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih also expunged all adverse remarks against Khan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116451540,imgsize-168066,width-400,resizemode-4/116451540.jpg"

Here's what Tharoor had said





NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor's recent praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ruffled some feathers in the Congress as fellow party leaders have questioned the move. Demanding an explanation for his praise, Tharoor's colleague Sandeep Dikshit went on to ask ""why are you in Congress"" and even termed him a ""hypocrite"".""Shashi Tharoor's problem is that I don't think he knows a lot about the country... If, according to you, someone is doing good for the country by going against the Congress's policies, then you should follow those policies... Why are you in Congress? Is it only because you are an MP?"" Dikshit said.""If you really feel that the BJP or PM Modi's strategies are working better than the party you are in, then you should give an explanation. If you are not giving one, you are a hypocrite,"" he added.Congress leader Supriya Shrinate had echoed similar sentiments as she said that she ""didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating"" and she didn't ""know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one"".""I didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating.

New Delhi: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Wednesday arrested gangster Lawrence Bishnoi 's brother, Anmol, upon his deportation from US. He arrived here on a special flight around 2pm, was produced in court and taken on a remand of 11 days.The agency arrested him in a case registered in 2022 to investigate an alleged nexus between criminal gangs in India and Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), a designated terrorist organisation, to raise funds, recruit youths and carry out terror strikes in the country.Anmol was accused of providing shelter and logistic support to shooters of the gangs and ground operatives in America. ""He was also allegedly engaged in extortion in India from foreign soil with the help of other gangsters,"" NIA said. The agency intends to ascertain details of social media accounts through which the Lawrence Bishnoi group has been taking responsibility for various crimes.Following his NIA custody, Anmol is likely to be handed over to police in Mumbai and Punjab in connection with the murder cases of NCP neta Baba Siddique and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala.Anmol's family claimed that he is being punished for his brother's crimes. ""I request the PM and home minister to ensure Anmol's security.The way gang war is happening, we are apprehensive... Our family has always respected the law. Whether Anmol is a culprit... it is part of the inquiry. His biggest crime is that he is the younger brother of Lawrence, but he has never been involved in the world of crime,"" said his cousin, Ramesh Bishnoi.Urging NIA to ensure his safety, the court ordered Anmol's medical examination to be conducted every 48 hours and his journey from court to the agency headquarters and vice versa video-recorded on completion of remand. NIA was asked to submit a report on measures taken for his security.Anmol had been absconding since 2022, NIA said. ""He is the 19th accused to be arrested for his involvement in the terror-syndicate led by his jailed brother, Lawrence. Anmol was chargesheeted by NIA in March 2023 after investigation established that he had actively aided designated terrorist Goldy Brar and Lawrence in the commission of various acts of terrorism in the country between 2020 and 2023,"" the agency claimed.Operating closely with various Bishnoi gang associates, Anmol continued to run syndicates and execute acts of terror from US, using the gang's operatives on the ground, NIA said.Anmol was detained in California's Sacramento last Nov for illegal entry after which FBI confirmed his identity through DNA and voice sample matches. He sought asylum while he was lodged at Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa. The facility's website showed he was being investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deals with cross-border crimes and undocumented immigration in US.An incident of firing at actor Salman Khan's house in Mumbai in April last year put Anmol under the lens. A Facebook account, purportedly belonging to him, claimed responsibility for the incident. Later, police chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters.On Oct 12, 2024, Siddique was gunned down outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son, Zeeshan. Anmol was named in a chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police. Soon, NIA announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information leading to his arrest.Anmol was also accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Moose Wala. He had allegedly fled India on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap a month before the rapper was killed on May 29, 2022.","Lawrence Bishnoi's brother, Anmol, arrested upon his deportation from US.

SC: 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-3-talaqs-sent-through-lawyer-not-valid/articleshow/125450139.cms,"Dr. Imam Ahmed Illyasi Explains Triple Talaq: Role Of Muslim Men & Women Revealed

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the validity of the practice among Muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs, each notified after a month’s gap, and said this would not be regarded as a valid annulment of marriage as the notices do not bear the man’s signature.Appearing for a TV journalist petitioner questioning the Muslim men’s unilateral right to divorce through triple talaq under Talaq-e-Hasan process, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices U Bhuyan and N K Singh that her advocate husband sent talaq notices through a lawyer, finalised divorce and remarried.“When a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document. If, based on this document, the woman remarries, the man can later accuse her of polyandry by claiming he has not validly divorced the woman. Moreover, whenever she wants to remarry, the other man can decline citing the invalidity of the divorce document,” Ahmed said.When senior advocate M R Shamshad attempted to justify the advocate husband’s action terming it as a custom prevalent among Muslims, Justice Kant-led bench asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?”“Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women.No one can give authorisation to a lawyer or any other person to give talaq notice to a woman on his behalf. If tomorrow the husband says he has not authorised the lawyer, what will happen to the woman? We have seen in many cases where the clients have disowned lawyers’ action,” the bench said.Deprecating the actions of the advocate-husband, the bench asked him to follow the Sharia law procedures and give a valid divorce to the woman, Benazeer Heena, who was present in court and narrated how she had been made to run from pillar to post after being virtually abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000. SC asked her to file an application seeking appropriate directions for her and child’s welfare and education. “We will do the needful,” it assured.Turning to Shamshad, Justice Kant said, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight? The relief cannot be confined to those women who have the wherewithal to move the SC. We will decide the validity of Talaq-e-Hasan after a detailed hearing. ”","Supreme Court questions validity of practice among Muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs.

"New weight-loss drugs work, but require long-term use: Doctor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-weight-loss-drugs-work-but-require-long-term-use-doctor/articleshow/125448310.cms,"You have watched the evolution of weight-loss drugs through five decades of practice. Did you think they would emerge as such blockbuster drugs?

But there are concerns about their side-effects…

The experience in the West has shown that almost 50% of the patients stop the drug after a year or so. Why does this happen?

New weight-loss drugs came to India only recently. What can we expect next?

What are the points to consider before taking up weight-loss drugs?

If you start taking the new weight-loss medications, be ready to stay with it for a long time, says Dr V Mohan, Chennai-based senior diabetologist who has worked extensively on the epidemiology and genetics of the disease. Excerpts from his chat with TOI, which is partnering with Novo Nordisk India to spearhead the ‘Choose Your Weight’ campaign, which aims to change the narrative around obesity.Q:A: Efforts to develop effective weight-reduction medicines have been on for decades. In the late 80s and 90s, drugs such as sibutramine, phentermine and orlistat were introduced that facilitated modest weight loss of 1kg or 2kg, and rarely around 5kg. Some of these drugs had major side-effects and were eventually banned. We, as physicians, began to lose hope that any drug would come along that could offer significant weight loss without significant side-effects.Then, we started getting drugs such as the GLP-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1RAs). Exenatide was the first; it came from the venom of a Gila monster in South America, and ensured significant weight loss than earlier drugs.Initially, we didn’t know how they worked, but they delayed gastric emptying and increased insulin release and glucagon reduction... They work through the potentiation of certain hormones in the intestine called GLP, the glucagon-like peptide. Researchers tried to make glucagon-like peptide itself, but it was very short-acting in the body. So, they started producing GLP-like substances.Exenatide was followed by liraglutide. We found these mainly anti-diabetic drugs offered a two-in-one response by helping people reduce weight. Not everyone responded the same way; some had both weight reduction and HbA1c reduction, others had only one; a small percentage had neither.Then came semaglutide, which took the world by storm. Semaglutide was a weekly injection marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. It got approved in the US separately for weight loss and diabetes, marking the first time an anti-diabetic drug was used solely for weight loss. It became a blockbuster drug with billions in sales, and millions started using it due to its unprecedented weight loss results, often 10-15 kg. The drug became so popular that it was hard to find, and new factories had to be built to meet the demand. Celebrities started using it, and before-and-after pictures were circulated widely. They were sold on the black market. This kind of success story with any drug had never been seen in the history of medicine.Q:A: These drugs, including liraglutide and exenatide, work on the stomach, causing nausea initially. They must be started at a small dose and gradually increased to minimise side-effects. After four to eight weeks, side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea usually settle.Stomach paralysis is a rare side-effect. Another rare but serious side effect is blindness due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. One in 7,000-10,000 people who take these drugs can go blind. Such rare side-effects will surface only when millions start taking a drug. It’s like the Covid vaccination: as mass vaccination was carried out, we saw side-effects. We don’t know why those idiosyncratic reactions occur, but we must remember there’s no big FDA warning so far. Clearly, its benefits far outweigh the risks.Q:A: Cost is a disadvantage, especially since there are no generic versions. The other reason is “plateauing”. After a patient loses 10kg, 15kg or 20kg, the drug’s effect plateaus off. In trials, those who stopped taking the drug started gaining weight. In one year, they regained 50% of the weight they lost. In practice, the minute people’s weight starts plateauing after taking the drug for a year or so, they stop as they don’t want to spend money on a drug that has seemingly stopped working.People think diet and exercise will help them, but obesity is complex. It’s not just calories in, calories out. If that was the case, there would be no need for these drugs. All these years people have been trying to lose weight but failed because of the brain: when one starts losing weight, the brain realises that you lost weight and immediately corrects itself trying to regain your weight. The point is that one needs to continue taking the drug to stay on that plateau.Q:A: In India, we were waiting for semaglutide and tirzepatide to become available. The injectable forms were delayed until recently, but by March 2026, the patent for semaglutide will expire, allowing generic versions to enter the market. There are over 20 companies that plan to make generic versions available.Companies are now developing a third drug, retatrutide, which targets three hormones: GLP, GIP, and glucagon. It’s in late stages of development and shows promise for even greater weight loss.These drugs offer numerous benefits beyond weight loss, including reduced risk of heart attack, improved kidney function, and potential cognitive benefits. They also help reduce snacking and other addictions, like smoking. One of my patients who was asked to undergo bilateral knee replacement decided to go on weight-loss medication first; he lost 20kg and didn’t need replacement as the knee pain vanished.Q:A: One has to consider that when one loses 10kg, it’s not 10kg of fat. It’s 7kg of fat and 3kg of muscle. That means from the little muscle you have, 3kg is going to go. Hence, people get ozempic facies with muscles gone… As your strength will be reduced, one needs to increase protein intake, do some weight training and muscle strength training.","If you start taking the new weight-loss medications, be ready to stay with it for a long time, says Dr V Mohan, Chennai-based senior diabetologist. Semaglutide, which took the world by storm, was a weekly injection marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125448603,imgsize-861116,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"
Narayana Murthy points to China’s 9-9-6 rule to justify 72-hour work week: Indian youth says enough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/narayana-murthy-points-to-chinas-9-9-6-rule-to-justify-72-hour-weeks-indian-youth-says-enough/articleshow/125386477.cms,"Infosys co-founder N.

Narayana Murthy Sparks Fresh Storm By Urging to Adopt China’s 996 Model, Work 72 Hours Every Week

When hard work turns into hard living

India Work-Life Balance Survey 2024

India is already working long weeks

A moment where social media spoke for the workforce

There is another way to work

Why balance matters to young professionals

Fair pay

Predictable hours

Time to rest

Mental stability

Supportive management

Opportunities to grow without losing personal time

A new direction for corporate India

India has been arguing about work life balance for years. Long hours, late-night calls, weekend emails, and the pressure to stay reachable have become routine across workplaces. Many workers say the system drains energy and leaves no room to disconnect. Each time the debate begins to slow down, a familiar voice pushes it back into the spotlight. Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy has done that more than once. His views on discipline and long work hours often trigger responses because they cut close to what young professionals experience every day.His latest comment has renewed the debate. In an interview with Republic TV, Murthy said, “There is a saying in China, 9, 9, 6. You know what it means? 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week. And that is a 72-hour work week,” and added that young Indians should follow the same routine. The pushback was immediate. For Indian workforce, Murthy's remark does not match the conditions they live with. Through various social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, they pointed to long commutes, rising expenses, uneven salaries, and a growing culture of after-hours communication. Many argued that extending the workday is not a solution for a system that already stretches people beyond capacity.The reaction showed how clearly the workforce understands its limits and what it wants from the future.Working long hours has not translated into better results. Many young professionals already spend most of their day working or travelling. The strain shows up in energy levels, mental focus, and motivation.Indeed'sfound that 88 percent of Indian employees receive work-related messages outside official hours. It also showed that 85 percent are contacted during sick leave or holidays. These interruptions have blurred the line between personal time and office responsibilities. The report linked poor balance to burnout, with 52 percent of workers identifying it as a major cause. The findings highlight a pattern where effort is rising but recovery time is shrinking.This is not about a workforce avoiding responsibility. It is about workers who feel stretched because work follows them everywhere.International Labour Organisation (ILO) data from early 2025 shows that Indian employees work an average of 46.7 hours a week. More than half work beyond 49 hours. These numbers are higher than the working hours in Western Europe. The ILO report notes that extended schedules affect mental health, family time, and long-term well-being.For many workers, a large part of the day is already taken up by long tasks and traffic. The idea of increasing hours feels out of sync with how people live and work today.Murthy’s statement moved quickly across social platforms. The responses offered a clear view of how workers interpret the reality of their jobs and personal lives.Before the first wave of reactions, many young Indians drew a comparison they often make when this topic reappears. They pointed to regions where work is structured around life, not the other way around. This led into one of the first viral posts.Many young workers pointed out that other regions structure work in a way that leaves space for life.As the discussion intensified, the next theme surfaced. Workers said compensation shapes how much time they are willing to put in. A longer workweek, some argued, might be negotiable if pay matched global standards.Others said they would consider longer hours if pay matched the effort and global benchmarks.A third set of comments focused on everyday economic realities. Many said expectations must reflect the infrastructure, wages, and costs that define life in India today.Some reactions reminded leaders that work expectations must match the wider economic reality of everyday life in India.There was also pushback to the China comparison. Users noted that China itself has taken steps to limit extreme hours.Many users also corrected the narrative by pointing out what Murthy left out about China’s work culture.Taken together, these reactions reflected a collective voice. Workers spoke about pay, time, and the need for a system that respects boundaries.Many comments compared India to Europe. In several European countries, a shorter workday and a fixed workweek help people maintain stability. Evenings are available for rest, and weekends are not extensions of office hours. The idea is not to replicate another country’s model. It is to recognise that balance supports better performance than exhaustion.Work life balance is a core expectation for this generation. It helps build sustainable careers and supports learning, decision-making, and long-term growth. High stress leads to errors, low engagement, and higher attrition.Young workers are asking for conditions that let them contribute without feeling worn out. They want:They want careers that push them forward, not lives that run on empty.If India wants stronger growth, it needs to focus on how work is structured. This includes reducing inefficiency, setting clear expectations, and respecting personal boundaries. Companies need systems that allow workers to stay productive without sacrificing their well-being.India’s young workforce is ready to contribute with purpose. What they need is a culture that supports both work and life.This debate is not about resistance. It is about sustainability. Young workers want a future where effort produces progress, not exhaustion.","Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Murthy urged India to adopt China’s 996 Model, Work 72 Hours Every Week.

SRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced Monday the arrest of a Kashmiri college student from Srinagar linked to Delhi suicide bomber Dr Umar Un Nabi, hours after the suspect's father died in hospital of burns suffered in a purported immolation attempt outside their home in Anantnag district's Qazigund.Jasir Bilal Wani, aka Danish, had been detained four days ago for interrogation along with his paternal uncle Nabeel Wani, a physics teacher.The family said Jasir's father Bilal Ahmad Wani, 55, was summoned by police last Saturday and he returned home ""distressed"". The next morning, Bilal walked out of his house in the Wanpora neighbourhood of Qazigund and set himself ablaze, resulting in severe burns. The dry fruits trader died at Srinagar's SMHS Hospital early Monday.NIA issued a statement confirming that Jasir's interrogation over the past few days yielded clues to the Delhi blast, including what the agency said was his ""active involvement"" in the car blast that killed 14 people and wounded over 30 people.""Investigations have revealed that Jasir allegedly provided technical support for terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast,"" NIA said.""The accused was a co-conspirator who worked closely with the terrorist, Umar Un Nabi, to plan the terror carnage.

A police bulldozer is used to uncover a drain to search for bodies, outside a house in Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi, on December 29, 2006. The police has arrested two men after recovering from a drain, parts of 15 skeletons of girls and boys behind an industrialist's house. The caretaker of the house Subhash alias Surendra reportedly told the cops he had been sexually abusing and strangulating his victims before disposing of their bodies in the drain.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes.

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud. Three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.

Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha likely to retain deputy CM posts

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Nitish Kumar is set to take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday after leading his party, JDU , and the governing bloc, NDA , to their second-best performance in the state, proving his resilience and popularity in an election where he was perceived as a vulnerable link in the alliance.Nitish and his ministerial colleagues will be sworn in at the historic Gandhi Maidan - the sprawling venue of his inauguration in 2005, and later in 2010 and 2015, before he chose the sober precincts of the Raj Bhawan as he swung between alliances and his stock fell. PM Narendra Modi , Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and several CMs, and allies such as N Chandrababu Naidu and Eknath Shinde will attend the ceremony.Sources said around 20 legislators may be sworn as ministers against a maximum strength of 36.Deliberations continued late on Thursday to finalise details of portfolio allocations after Shah arrived in Patna.Also read: 4 of 5 Bihar seats with max & min SIR deletions won by NDA PM Narendra Modi had not attended the ceremony in 2020, an election in which NDA barely scraped through due to the drastic fall in JDU's tally to 43 from 71 in 2015. Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda were then the main presence from their party.If the return to Gandhi Maidan, likely to be thronged by a big crowd of supporters, attests to Nitish Kumar's bolstered political strength after JDU's numbers soared to 85, the presence of BJP bigwigs underscores the surge in the party's confidence as well as its show of support to his leadership.BJP has emerged as the single-largest party with 89 seats.Nitish (74) was elected the leader of the NDA legislature party in a meeting of MLAs and senior leaders of its five constituents - LJP(RV), HAM(S) and RLM besides the two main parties - and he was then joined by allies in staking claim to governor Arif Mohammad Khan.BJP lawmakers re-elected Samrat Choudhary, an OBC Kushwaha, as their leader, while Vijay Kumar Sinha, a upper caste Bhumihar, was picked as his deputy, in a clear indication that they would retain the position of deputy CMs in the new govt.BJP has stuck to the backward-upper caste combination for the top two jobs from its quota, a social coalition which was the hallmark of its candidate selection in the election.BJP and JDU have held lengthy deliberations to finalise details of the new govt, with both parties agreeing to the status-quo in key positions after exchange of differing views. If there was a suggestion from some in JDU for getting the speaker's post, currently held by its ally, BJP indicated its keenness for the home department, which is administered by Nitish, sources said, adding that the existing arrangement is likely to continue.Sources said, among outgoing ministers, Nitin Nabin, Mangal Pandey, Nitish Mishra and Sanjay Saraogi may be retained from the BJP quota. JDU's Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Lacy Singh and Shravan Kumar, too, are tipped to be sworn in as ministers again along with representatives of three other allies.After being elected BJP legislature party leader, Choudhary said the new govt would work in overdrive to fulfill the development vision of Modi and Nitish for Bihar.","Nitish Kumar set to take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Though a push from women supporters on account of incentives, including a Rs 10,000 transfer in their bank accounts, was a big factor in NDA's landslide win in Bihar, the alliance wasn't the only beneficiary of high participation in the polls by women. AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout - namely Kochadhaman, Baisi and Amour - indicating that the correlation between women turnout and electoral outcome was not always straight. AIMIM's total tally was 5 seats. JDU, meanwhile, won in Thakurganj assembly constituency (AC) where 90% of the women turned up, while BJP was the victor in Pranpur, which saw 89% women turnout.The special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar, conducted amid resistance from the opposition led by Congress, saw NDA parties winning four of the five seats that accounted for the maximum as well as minimum deletions of electors in SIR. Significantly, Congress, with an overall tally of six seats, won Kishanganj despite the AC having recorded the fifth highest deletion among the state's 243 ACs, as well as Chanpatia, which saw second lowest deletion.As per Bihar poll datasets released by EC on Wednesday, BJP won three of the five seats with the highest net deletions - Gopalganj, Purnia and Motihari - followed by JDU, which won Kuchaikote. As regards the five ACs with the least net deletions, BJP and LJPRV won from two each. The datasets linking SIR and poll outcome, thus, do not fit into a pattern. Even so, the four seats (of total five) with the maximum and minimum deletions bagged by NDA are proportional to its overall 83% share in Bihar's 243 seats. Four of the five ACs with the maximum additions made to the Bihar electoral roll between Sept 30 and Oct 20 (the last date of nomination for Phase 2) are now represented by NDA parties, with BJP having its candidates elected from Nautan and Tarari, JDU from Thakurganj, Congress from Araria, and LJPRV from Chenari. The seats that saw the least number of additions to the roll in this period are now represented by JDU, BJP and LJPRV. Among the five seats with the highest winning margin, JDU won in Rupauli and Gopalpur, BJP in Digha and Aurai, and LJPRV in Sugauli. The list of top five ACs with the lowest victory margin includes Sandesh and Nabinagar won by JDU, Ramgarh won by BSP, Agiaon by BJP and Dhaka won by RJD.Congress won from Manihari (ST), the last among the five ACs that clocked the highest male polling percentage. BJP won two of the seats with the highest male voter turnout and three with the lowest male turnout. JDU and LJPRV each bagged one of the five seats with the highest and lowest male polling percentage.Kasba, which recorded the highest total polling percentage at 81.9%, ended up in LJPRV's kitty, Barari and Thakurganj ACs went the JDU way with 81.7% and 81.6% polling, respectively, while Congress bagged Kishanganj with the fifth highest overall turnout of 80.2%. BJP won four of the five seats with the lowest polling percentage - namely Kumhrar, Bankipur, Digha (all in Patna) and Biharsharif - even as JDU bagged Nawada.","AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout.

'One Wrong Can't Justify...': Bangladesh Expert On Elections After Sheikh Hasina Death Penalty

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Wednesday courted controversy when she shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case, saying it was a sign of ""things to come” in an apparent reference to the INDIA bloc’s allegation that the Election Commission of India (ECI) chief is ""colluding with the ruling BJP to rig elections"".Moitra, who is also the Lok Sabha MP, drew sharp retort from the BJP, which slammed her for speaking ""like an enemy of the country"".Lashing out at Mohua Moitra, BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said: “Mahua Moitra is a Member of Parliament of India, but she speaks like an enemy of the country. The kind of tweet she has posted now— is she trying to say that India’s democracy is like that of Bangladesh?""""Earlier too, we saw RJD leaders saying that if they lose the election, they will turn the country into Bangladesh or Nepal, creating such a situation. We have also seen Rahul Gandhi say that their fight is against the Indian State,” he told news agency ANI.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the ECI-led Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where the electoral roll revision is under way.He told party leaders that the Congress must counter the drive “politically, organisationally and legally,” according to sources quoted by PTI.Rahul, the sources said, argued that while the Election Commission is responsible for maintaining accurate voter rolls, it appeared to be shifting the burden onto political parties.He also questioned how the SIR was being implemented, warning that it “could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.”Several other Congress leaders echoed his fears, reviving their familiar “vote-chori” charge or calling the SIR a “sinister attempt to destroy Democracy”.Even as the opposition ramps up its resistance, the Election Commission reported that it has already distributed 50.25 crore enumeration forms across the 12 states and UTs, covering 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters. The first phase spans Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, head to the polls in 2026. Assam, also set for elections in 2026, received approval for a “special revision” of rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and will run until December 4.Rahul, meanwhile, has continued questioning the recent electoral outcomes. Last week, he termed the Bihar results “surprising” and cast doubt on the fairness of the process, saying the Congress and the INDIA bloc would scrutinise the outcome in detail. The party later alleged that the verdict reflected “vote chori on a gigantic scale, masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC”."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court struck down Wednesday the Tribunal Reforms Act as unconstitutional and slammed the central govt for its repeated attempts to override SC's consistent rulings to shield the judicial independence of tribunals, which decide disputes in a gamut of regimes - taxation, environment, electricity, telecom and real estate.Days before his retirement, a CJI B R Gavai-led bench deprecated the Centre's repeated attempts to tinker with the qualifications, tenure and service conditions for chairpersons and members of the tribunals and took umbrage that within weeks of SC striking down the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance in July 2021, the govt tabled a bill in Parliament to enact the law whose provisions were identical to that of the ordinance.Censuring the govt for ""consciously attempting to annul the rulings"" by enacting a law that had ""cosmetically changed a few provisions"" of the annulled law, the bench of CJI Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 is a replica of the struck-down ordinance; old wine in a new bottle, the wine whets not the judicial palate, but the bottle merely dazzles.""The verdict means that, pending the enactment of a new law, the service conditions of tribunal presidents and members would be governed by their parent Acts.For example, ITAT Act would govern service conditions of ITAT president and members.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, ""The provisions of the impugned Act cannot be sustained. They violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.""The Supreme Court said the Act directly contradicts binding judicial pronouncements that have repeatedly clarified the standards governing the appointment, tenure and functioning of tribunal members. The bench said that the Act, which intended to usher in uniformity in tenure and service conditions of all tribunal members, undermined the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality of tribunals by enabling the executive to exercise control over them.The Supreme Court said, ""Where Parliament reenacts provisions previously struck down without curing the underlying defect, the resulting legislation remains vulnerable to invalidation, not because the Court is imposing its own policy, but because the Constitution itself demands adherence to these structural safeguards.""""The Indian constitutional framework does not subscribe to parliamentary sovereignty, nor does it vest unqualified supremacy in the judiciary.""The architecture of our Constitution is firmly rooted in the principle of constitutional supremacy.""It said that when SC interprets the Constitution and pronounces upon the validity of a law, that pronouncement becomes the authoritative and binding declaration of the law.""Once the court has struck down a provision or issued binding directions after identifying a constitutional defect, Parliament cannot simply override or contradict that judicial decision by re-enacting the very same measure in a different form,"" CJI Gavai said.Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.","Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”"," 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter.

SRINAGAR: All Kashmiris were being looked at with suspicion in other parts of India because of the actions of a few, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said, adding that even he hesitated going out in Delhi in a J&K registered vehicle.Hitting out at the Centre and the LG administration, he said stripping J&K of its special status and statehood had not ended bloodshed, and those responsible for the UT’s security should answer for the current situation.The chief minister, while addressing a gathering in Kulgam, said the situation had deteriorated to the point that Kashmiri parents hesitated to send their children to other states for studies or jobs. “When fingers of suspicion are pointed at us from all sides, when actions of a few are used to defame all of us, when everyone is dragged into it because of the involvement of a few, it is difficult for us to leave J&K,” he said.Some of the Delhi car blast perpetrators and other suspects arrested in the white-collar terror module recently busted are from Kashmir.“Look at what happened in Delhi. A few were responsible but the impression is being created that all of us are to blame for it and all of us are involved in it.Today, driving a J&K-registered vehicle in Delhi is treated almost like a crime. When I’m not surrounded by security personnel, I wonder whether I should even drive my J&K-registered car or not. I fear being stopped and questioned,” he said.The CM was in Kulgam to visit the families of some of the victims of Friday’s blast inside Nowgam police station in Srinagar that killed a Special Investigation Agency officer, three FSL personnel, two revenue officials and a tailor associated with the station, and wounded 30 others.It was the Nowgam police station that probed the Jaish-e-Mohammad posters that appeared in Bonpora area on Oct 19, which led to the uncovering of the interstate terror module involving doctors and others.“What should we say about the situation today? If a bomb is not exploding in Delhi, it’s going off here,” the CM said. “Innocent people are losing their lives. Yesterday, I went to five homes to offer condolences and today I am visiting two more. We want this vicious cycle of violence to stop somewhere.”“In the past 30-35 years, we have witnessed blood and gore on a massive scale in the Valley. We were told it will end and that after 2019, the situation has improved. But it hasn’t, and why it hasn’t is a question for those responsible for our security. The responsibility of security does not lie with us,” Omar said.",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah says all Kashmiris are being looked at with suspicion in other parts of India because of the actions of a few.

No dispute, just different points of view: NDA neta

NEW DELHI: BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt, which will be sworn in on Thursday.Leaders of the two main NDA parties held long discussions on Tuesday, with sources indicating that BJP may retain the post of assembly Speaker. There is also a buzz that JDU, too, is interested in having the Speaker's chair, but sources said it was more an expression of aspirations as the two allies worked out the details of the new govt.It is learnt that Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has 19 MLAs and brings crucial Dalit votes to the alliance, is keen on having a deputy CM from its quota.BJP has two deputy CMs in the outgoing govt and is expected to keep the post to itself in the new dispensation as well. The name of Arun Bharti, the member of Lok Sabha from Jamui and Chirag's brother-in-law, was doing the rounds in political circles as LJP's choice for the position of deputy CM.Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda held talks with JDU working president Sanjay Jha and Lalan Singh, the regional party's presence in the Modi cabinet, as the composition of the new govt is likely to be somewhat different from the outgoing one due to the rise in JDU's numbers and entry of two new parties - LJP(RV) and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha.It is natural for allies to have different points of view in thrashing out the details of a govt with five parties. But there is no dispute,"" a key functionary said.National Democratic Alliance won a thumping majority by bagging 202 seats in the 243-member assembly. BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while JDU is close behind with 85. This contrasts starkly with the outgoing assembly in which BJP had 80 MLAs and JDU 43. This reflected in the power equation in the current govt in which BJP has 21 ministers as against 14 from its allies, including Nitish and an Independent MLA.This is for the first time that BJP and JDU have nearly equal strength. Until its number declined sharply in 2020, JDU was the dominant partner since they won their first state poll together in 2005. However, BJP has always endorsed Nitish's leadership.HAM(S) and RLM, having five and four MLAs each, are expected to get one berth in the new govt, while Paswan's party may bag two to three ministerial positions.BJP has two deputy CMs, one Kushwaha (OBC) and one Bhumihar (upper caste), in the outgoing govt. The party on Tuesday named an observer and two co-observers for the meeting of its legislature party to elect their leader. The choice of its three central leaders is rich on social messaging with Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, a prominent OBC face of the party in the state, being joined by Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, a Dalit, and former Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who comes from most backward Nishad caste.Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, who has seen as a rapid rise in BJP, is current legislature party leader and is being seen as a frontrunner for the position again.A joint meeting of NDA parties is expected to elect Nitish as their leader on Wednesday. PM Narendra Modi and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah besides other NDA heavyweights will be joining the oath-taking ceremony to be held in Patna's sprawling Gandhi Maidan in the presence of a big crowd.","BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt.

Tharoor praises PM Modi’s lecture



Congress leader disagrees



NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday took a sharp dig at Congress for criticising party MP Shashi Tharoor after he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s recent address at the Ramnath Goenka Lecture, saying the party should rather be called ""Indira Nazi Congress.""BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said the Congress reacts harshly to anyone who ""keeps national interest above ‘Parivaric’ interest,"" adding that internal dissent is discouraged within the party.""If somebody praises the Prime Minister's speech, which is about larger issues, then a 'fatwa' is issued against that person by the Congress, which talks about democracy in the entire country, but there is no democracy within their party... if someone keeps national interest above 'Parivaric' interest, then a fatwa is issued against them,"" Shehzad Poonawalla told ANI.He further claimed that the Congress displays an ""emergency mindset,"" remarking that the party should be called the ""Indira Nazi Congress.”""It should not be called the ' Indian National Congress '; it should be called the 'Indira Nazi Congress' because they demonstrate Indira's emergency mindset and Nazi dictatorial behaviour,"" Poonawalla added.Tharoor, who attended the Ramnath Goenka Lecture on the invitation of the Indian Express, had posted a detailed note on X praising several aspects of the Prime Minister’s speech.In his post, Tharoor wrote, ""Attended PM @narendramodi's Ramnath Goenka Lecture. He spoke of India's 'constructive impatience' for development and strongly pushed for a post-colonial mindset. The PM emphasized that India is no longer just an 'emerging market' but an 'emerging model' for the world, noting its economic resilience. PM Modi said he'd been accused of being in ""election mode"" all the time, but he was really in ""emotional mode"" to redress the problems of the people. ""Tharoor also noted the PM’s call for a national mission to reclaim India’s cultural heritage. ""A significant part of the speech was dedicated to overturning Macaulay's 200-year legacy of 'slave mentality.' PM Modi appealed for a 10-year national mission to restore pride in India's heritage, languages, and knowledge systems. I wish he had also acknowledged how Ramnath Goenka had used English to raise a voice for Indian nationalism!"" his post read.He added that the address felt both like an economic outlook and a cultural call to action, saying he was ""glad to have been in the audience despite battling a bad cold and cough.""Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, however took jab at the Thiruvananthapuram MP stating that she did not find PM Modi’s address impressive and questioned what Tharoor found worth appreciating.Shrinate had said, ""I didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating. I think PM must answer a lot of things. He was at an event of a newspaper. He should tell us what his problem is with fair journalism. He should have told us why is he not happy with those who show and speak truth... So, I didn't see any reason to appreciate him.""""I don't know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one...I found it to be a petty speech. He criticised Congress there too.

PM Modi Reveals Why NDA Swept Bihar, Says Emotional Mode And 24x7 Development Win Elections In India

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said India is on the path to becoming a global hub of natural farming, asserting that the agriculture sector has undergone a major transformation over the last 11 years and that agricultural exports have “almost doubled”.Addressing a gathering in Coimbatore after releasing the 21st instalment of PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM said natural farming is a subject “very close” to his heart. More than Rs 18,000 crore were transferred to the bank accounts of nine crore beneficiaries under the scheme.Extending his appreciation to Tamil Nadu farmers for hosting the South India Natural Farming Summit, he said, ""I extend best wishes to all farmers of Tamil Nadu for organising the wonderful South India Natural Farming Summit.""Further talking about his interactions the Prime Minister added, ""I was watching the exhibition. I received the opportunity to speak to several farmers. Someone had pursued Mechanical Engineering, PhD and was then doing farming, someone was doing farming by leaving NASA, they are preparing and training several youth. I accept this publicly, had I not come here to this event, I would have missed a lot in my life. By coming here today, I have learnt a lot.I salute the courage of farmers of Tamil Nadu, I salute their strength to accept change."" PM Modi said India’s agricultural landscape is evolving and the youth are increasingly seeing farming as a modern and scalable career path.

To make agriculture modern, government has thrown open all paths to support the farmers.""PM Modi also talked about maintaining soil fertility amid increasing demand for agricultural products saying, ""In recent years, the increasing demand for agricultural products has led to a rapid rise in the use of various chemicals in the sector. As a result, soil fertility is deteriorating, and the cost of farming is escalating. The solution lies in adopting crop diversification and natural farming practices. To restore soil fertility and enhance the nutritional value of crops, we must embrace natural farming methods. This approach is not only a necessity, but also a part of our vision for sustainable agriculture.""On a sidenote, as the Prime Minister noticed two girl students waving placards praising him, he asked security personnel to bring the placards to him, and lauded the students.Before the address, PM Modi inaugurated the South India Natural Farming Summit and interacted with local farmers.

NEW DELHI: In a major reform to strengthen aviation safety oversight and better protect air travellers’ interests, India has set the old plan of restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like SEBI or TRAI into motion. A Parliamentary panel had sought the restructuring to give teeth to the regulator as air traffic has grown exponentially in the last decade while in its current setup the DGCA battles legacy issues like staff shortage which can’t be tackled at the required pace.Based on the parliamentary committee’s advice and directions of the Union aviation ministry, the DGCA prepared a report outlining its proposed restructuring. The same is learnt to have been submitted this week to the ministry, including secretary Samir Kumar Sinha who is keen on having an autonomous aviation regulatory body on the lines of telecom and securities market regulators (TRAI & SEBI). Highly placed sources say the restructuring will happen in a “staggered manner” after the ministry takes a view on the DGCA report.It is learnt that the proposed restructuring of DGCA into CAA may also put in place a dedicated system to protect consumer interests and ensure their grievances are promptly redressed.The proposed CAA with statutory status will also see the latter getting a funding mechanism with the options being levying a small charge on flyers. A self-funded regulator not dependent on govt for grants will be able to offer market-linked salaries competitively to attract talent and invest in latest technology for effective oversight.The idea of having a truly autonomous Civil Aviation Authority has been in the works for years but it has got a push in recent times due to the growth in India’s air traffic with airlines having close to 2,000 planes on order; dozens of new airports opening and the skies getting crowded requiring more safety oversight.DGCA manpower didn’t keep pace with the growing air traffic. It recently started creating a “pool” of its retired technical officers “to provide advisory support in the certification process” due to the manpower crunch. “It has often been observed that applicants and entities face difficulties navigating the entire process, leading to delays and compliance challenges,” the regulator admits in its note for creating this pool.",India has set the old plan of restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like SEBI or TRAI into motion.

Surat evaluates electric freight vehicles under clean air programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surat-evaluates-electric-freight-operations-under-clean-air-programme/articleshow/125439609.cms,"Representative AI image

Surat recently concluded a pilot programme testing electric freight vehicles at the Surat Textile Market to assess their feasibility and potential to cut emissions from commercial transport.The initiative involved deployment of electric small commercial vehicles (e-SCVs) and light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) across multiple logistics stages in the market, one of the city's largest trading hubs. While full data analysis is still in progress, preliminary findings suggest lower operating costs and reduced tailpipe emissions compared to conventional diesel vehicles.The pilot forms part of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s measures under the National Clean Air Programme. The project was undertaken in collaboration with WRI India, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), Switch Mobility and Euler Motors.Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of India’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets. According to officials, the majority of these trips are handled by over 7,500 diesel, petrol and CNG-powered vehicles, contributing substantially to local emissions.Representatives from the textile traders' associations and partner organisations said the pilot offers insights on fleet operations and could help inform future policy and investments in commercial e-mobility. The programme is part of WRI India’s Accelerator for Clean Air Actions and a larger UNEP-led project supported by the Global Environment Facility, with guidance from NITI Aayog.","Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of India’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets.

EC orders Special Revision of Assam’s electoral rolls







NEW DELHI: With the state of Assam set to go to assembly polls next year, political sparring between the BJP and Congress has intensified, with both sides staking claim to a clear win in the 2026 showdown.Speaking to reporters in Dhubri, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said the BJP is on its way to defeat in the next state elections. Gaurav alleged that the ruling party carried out the 2023 delimitation exercise in a way that ""only benefited the BJP"" and is now introducing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) as it fears losing seats.""BJP is heading for defeat in 2026 (Assam Assembly election) if only Assamese people vote; we urge people to stay alert so no voters from UP and Bihar can vote,"" Gogoi said.The 2023 delimitation raised Scheduled Caste seats from eight to nine and Scheduled Tribe seats from 16 to 19, while keeping the total assembly seats unchanged at 126. As per reports analysts say the number of Muslim-dominated seats has reduced from 30 to 22 under the redrawn map, which will be used in the 2026 elections.Addressing a rally in Nalbari, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma escalated his attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, saying the Congress leader would ""hundred per cent lose"" the upcoming state polls.""He (Gogoi) will hundred per cent lose the polls in Assam, and then he can contest the elections in Pakistan,"" Sarma said, responding to Gogoi's earlier comments on the political climate in the state further adding that, ""Assam is Assam and we will make a clean sweep in the assembly elections.”Sarma also accused the Congress of ""doing politics"" over the death of singer Zubeen Garg to ""protect the Miyas who have encroached acres of land across the state.”The chief minister has repeatedly targeted Gogoi in recent months, alleging links with Pakistan’s ISI and forming an SIT to probe the matter, though its findings have not yet been made public.Sarma further claimed that ""the Congress is mainly concerned about 'Miyas', and the people of Assam will not vote for those who support them.”He also announced that the government will introduce the anti-polygamy bill in the upcoming assembly session. ""We will present the anti-polygamy bill in the assembly in November,"" Sarma stated.The Election Commission on Monday ordered a Special Revision of the electoral rolls in Assam ahead of the 2026 elections. Earlier on Tuesday, Sarma, reiterating the need for updated rolls, said that the exercise would help identify and remove ineligible voters.He noted that the state's National Register of Citizens (NRC) has not been notified ""due to various legacy issues,"" and that the Special Intensive Revision has therefore been deferred.However, with the Election Commission now ordering a Special Revision, Sarma said the process ""will help us weed out the illegal (voters) from our electoral process.”.According to EC guidelines issued to the state’s chief electoral officer, January 1, 2026, has been set as the qualifying date for the Special Revision. Officials said the drive is positioned between the usual annual summary revision and a full Special Intensive Revision (SIR).Last month, the Election Commission had ordered SIR in 12 states and Union Territories, including four set to vote next year.","The Election Commission on Monday ordered a Special Revision of the electoral rolls in Assam ahead of the 2026 elections.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: Civil society organisations and farmer groups on Tuesday expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty, saying the changes would lead to the opening up of almost all of India’s genetic resources related to agriculture and food to seed companies of developed countries.They jointly wrote to Union ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Bhupender Yadav, flagging that the move at the upcoming global forum in Peru would in effect dismantle India’s ability to determine how, when and by whom its agricultural genetic resources are accessed.The issues, including the proposed amendment, is scheduled to be discussed at the upcoming 11th session of the governing body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) in Lima, Peru, during Nov 24-29.The organisations, led by Asha (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) Kisan Swaraj, demanded that the govt appoint a well experienced multilateral negotiator to attend negotiations in Lima, who can protect the nation’s interests, especially the interests of the custodians of plant genetic resources, the country’s farmers.In their letter to the ministers, the civil society groups said, ""The draft package, if adopted, will force India to share the genetic wealth with the Global North (developed countries) where the big agribusiness, big tech, multinational seed companies, biotech industry, major gene banks, and research organizations are located, but without accountability and transparency measures in place.""As these actors would be able to access all the Indian Plant Germplasm from national collections, international gene banks, and CGIAR institutions without informing the national authorities of the provider countries, and they will have to just sign a precarious Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) adopted by the GB of the Plant Treaty.""Their letter came days after a group of scientists wrote a similar letter to Chouhan. The scientists raised objections over a proposed move to tweak provisions of benefit sharing on use of genetic resources. The scientists flagged that the current proposals to “enhance” the treaty's multilateral system are fundamentally unjust and pose an immediate, existential threat to India’s sovereign rights over its vast genetic wealth and the fundamental rights of its farmers.Genetic resources are currently shared under law for research and advancements in medicine and agriculture. It is largely believed that the full access to such resources, instead of a negotiated access, could significantly compromise the nation’s sovereign rights over its own genetic resources and override domestic legislation, like India’s Biodiversity Act.","Civil society organisations and farmer groups expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty.

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

BENGALURU: Scientists at Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves out of the inner Solar system after its recent perihelion passage.Using PRL’s 1.2m telescope at Mount Abu, researchers observed the comet between Nov 12 and 15. The images show a near-circular coma, the cloud of gas and dust that forms around a comet’s nucleus when solar heating causes surface ices to sublimate.“In the present geometry, any dust tail would lie behind the comet relative to the Earth, while deeper multiband images could reveal the ion tail,” Isro said.Ahead of morning twilight, the team also recorded a spectrum of the comet’s light. It showed clear emission features associated with Solar system comets, including CN, C2 and C3 bands at shorter wavelengths.“Researchers calculated the production rates of these molecular emissions, which describe how much gas is released from the nucleus into the coma. For 3I/ATLAS, the values are around 10²⁵ molecules per second. The ratios of these rates place the object among the ‘typical comets’ of the Solar system despite its interstellar origin,” Isro said.PRL’s Mount Abu telescope, situated at an altitude of 1,680m near Gurushikhar, supports studies ranging from exoplanets to high-energy sources. The team plans further observations as 3I/ATLAS moves into darker skies.","Scientists at Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

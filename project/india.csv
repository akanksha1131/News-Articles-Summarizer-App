NEW DELHI: Balasore BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi on Monday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of inappropriate behaviour during a scuffle outside Parliament building on December 19, likening his actions to those of a ""bouncer"" rather than a responsible leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha—a position once held by esteemed figures like Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sarangi, who was injured in the incident, shared his account with reporters after being discharged from the hospital on December 28.Recalling the incident, Sarangi said, ""It happened when we (BJP MPs) were standing near an entry gate, peacefully protesting against the insult of Dr. Ambedkar , holding placards.""""Suddenly, Rahul Gandhi came along with some of his party colleagues and started pushing people to move ahead. He was behaving like a bouncer, not like the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha , a post once occupied by great personalities like Vajpayee ji,"" BJP MP added.Sarangi alleged that Gandhi's actions caused MP Mukesh Rajput to lose balance and fall, leading to Sarangi’s own injury. ""Rajput ji fell on me, and my head struck a hard surface, possibly a stone-like object, resulting in a deep cut,"" he recounted, mentioning that his head injury required stitches.When asked if Gandhi showed concern afterward, Sarangi acknowledged that the Congress leader briefly approached him but left quickly. ""He came near me when informed about the incident but displayed no genuine concern. My recovery is due to the blessings of Lord Jagannath,"" Sarangi said.","Balasore BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of inappropriate behaviour during a scuffle outside Parliament building on December 19.

Koraput Jail: Where prisoners suffer incarceration and earn income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/koraput-jail-where-prisoners-suffer-incarceration-and-earn-income/articleshow/116813588.cms,"Representative image

Proposes to operate

fly-ash brick kiln

and a petrol pump by inmates

NEW DELHI: A more than a century-old circle jail in Odisha’s tribal-dominated Koraput district is synchronizing ‘crime and punishment’ with ‘reforms and income’ to enable prisoners to sale various items produced by using their skills in handicrafts, agriculture, tailoring, weaving and by operating fabrication and pulverizing units.Established in 1908 and having a capacity of 1003 prisoners, a surprise visit by Justice Sanjeeb Panigrahi of Orissa HC and his suggestions opened a new chapter for the prison and its inmates – upgrading of sanitation infrastructure, hygienic condition and establishment of small-scale industrial infrastructure.Jail authorities also started honing and imparting skills and crafts to inmates in weaving, growing vegetables, tailoring, and fabricating metal products. “These products and vegetables are sold regularly in specially organized markets. The sale of these products, including for the current financial year, is expected to touch Rs 80 lakhs by March 31, 2025,” Jailor L B Dash told TOI.The Jail has already deposited around 50 lakhs as revenue receipts with the state government. Rest of the amount is paid directly into the bank accounts of the inmates at the rate of Rs 145 per day for skilled labour, Rs 110 for semi-skilled, and Rs 95 for unskilled ones, senior Jail superintendent Kuanr Marandi said.Of around 500 inmates, 128 have chosen to engage in various activities run by the jail. On completing their prison term, they return home with a good amount of money. But the thrust of the initiative is to enable them to self-sustain by engaging in a vocation in which they got trained during their imprisonment period, the jail officials said.The officials said DG (Prison) Arun Kumar Roy has in principle agreed with the proposal to set up a fly-ash brick industry and a petrol pump, in collaboration with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd , in the land owned by the jail to engage inmates after their release as a measure of rehabilitation.Inmates engaged in fabrication unit are making various household items like almirah, rice containers, utensils stands, wall hangers and steel trunks of different sizes, while those working in the weaving unit produce handloom items like shirt pieces, bed sheets, curtains, towels, doormats, handkerchiefs, aprons, salwar suits, saris etc.In the pulverizing units, the prisoners produce turmeric and millet powders, while others make different varieties of bamboo crafts using bamboo grown in the jail garden, which also grows organic vegetables which are sold to the public through the jail's retail counter.The Jail authorities have moved the Koraput District Magistrate for training inmates under PM Viswakarma Yojana which could offer a better rehabilitation platform for inmates after their release.","A circle jail in Odisha’s tribal-dominated Koraput district is synchronizing ‘crime and punishment’ with ‘reforms and income’ Jail authorities also started honing and imparting skills and crafts to inmates in weaving, growing vegetables, tailoring, and fabricating metal products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116813621,imgsize-570149,width-400,resizemode-4/116813621.jpg"
ISRO set to mark 100th launch with GSLV mission after successful SpaDeX experiment: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-set-to-mark-100th-launch-with-gslv-mission-after-successful-spadex-experiment-isro-chief/articleshow/116812953.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in January, ISRO Chairman S Somanath announced.This achievement will be highlighted by a Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) mission, following Monday’s successful PSLV-C60 mission, which marked the 99th launch from the Sriharikota spaceport.India on Monday took a major step towards joining an exclusive group of nations with space-docking technology — the ability to mate two spacecraft in space. ISRO successfully placed two small satellites, each weighing 220 kg, into orbit as part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission.The PSLV-C60 rocket, which lifted off just after 10 PM from the first launchpad at Sriharikota, placed the satellites into a 475-km circular orbit about 15 minutes later. The first satellite separated 15.1 minutes after launch, followed by the second at 15.2 minutes.M Sankaran, Director of the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), explained that the 'chaser' and 'target' spacecraft were launched with a small relative velocity, allowing them to move towards each other for potential future docking operations.Speaking after the successful PSLV-C60 launch, Somanath highlighted the significance of the milestone: ""So, all of you have seen the majestic lift-off and the launch of the SpaDeX (Space Docking Experiment) rocket, and for us, this is the 99th launch of any vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. That is also a very important number. So, we are going for the 100th launch at the beginning of the next year.""Monday’s PSLV-C60 mission paves the way for more complex docking experiments, with Somanath noting, ""There will be many more SpaDeX varieties, including complex missions of docking systems in the coming days.""ISRO’s ambitious plans continue into 2025, with the NVS-02 navigation satellite scheduled for launch in January using a GSLV rocket. This follows the successful deployment of the NVS-01 satellite in May 2023, marking the first of the second-generation satellites for the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services.The PSLV-C60 launch was initially scheduled for 9:58 PM on December 30 but was rescheduled to 10 PM following a ""conjunction study"" to ensure no close proximity between satellites in orbit. Somanath explained the process: ""If you find there is any close proximity between satellites, then we have to move the current satellite a little bit. Either, we delay it or make it early, so that this proximity condition does not occur.""","Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in January.

Among the other initiatives credited are WHO-protocol gate-keeper training for hostel wardens, SOS Help, student engagement programmes like 'Dinner with Collector' and 'Samwad', and the police's Kalika Squad to ensure the safety for female students.Speaking to TOI on Monday, Kota district collector Dr Ravindra Goswami said, ""The reduction in suicides is substantial and our efforts (to curb them) are yielding results, and we expect this trend to continue.""Goswami mentioned his personal interaction with over 25,000 coaching students throughout the year through various initiatives, providing career guidance and addressing their concerns.The district administration, alongside coaching stakeholders, also introduced 'Kota Cares' during the three-day Kota Mahotsav that concluded last Wednesday. ""KotaCares emphasises that the city has provided coaching to over one crore students nationwide, significantly influencing their careers. The initiative reaffirms, through coaching alumni collaboration, that Kota maintains its standards with enhanced facilities and environment,"" the district collector said.Coaching industry stakeholders note that Kota suffered in 2024 due to the negative publicity over the coaching students' deaths, despite not being among the top 30 cities in India as per NCRB's suicide data.

"In Bastar, battle for hearts & minds via bijli-sadak-paani",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-bastar-battle-for-hearts-minds-via-bijli-sadak-paani/articleshow/116812333.cms,"RAIPUR: No network, no roads but hope is being built, brick by brick, in a very remote part of Abujhmarh in Bastar. More used to the crack of gunshots, tribals in Rekavaya village now hear the hum of cement mixers where a school is coming up. The first since Independence.Like Rekavaya, some 300km from Raipur, all of Bastar is seeing a resurgence. 2024 will go down as the year when the 'battle for hearts and minds' was no longer a cliche in this battleground.And like Rekavaya, change is coming to Bastar at the cost of human lives. Eight Maoists were shot dead in Rekavaya earlier this year and security camps were set up in the vicinity. Only then could boats ply down River Indravati, carrying bricks and cement needed to build the school that once Maoists ran.Where Mao's Little Red Book was once part of syllabus, today children read the tables. And that's much the same story in rest of Bastar.At least 222 Maoists have been gunned down by security forces in Bastar since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took over - more than the previous five years combined. This aggressive campaign has pushed Maoists out of their erstwhile strongholds - including the once-impregnable Abujhmarh - and cleared a path for bijli, sadak and paani.Nearly 50 schools that were closed down two decades ago due to Maoist violence have been reopened - some of them rebuilt by the very Maoists who had demolished them, now on this side of society, having ditched their guns in the jungle and seeking to pick up life afresh.The force of the campaign this year can be gauged from the body count - 20 Maoists were eliminated in 2023, nearly 11 times as many have been neutralised this year, with 31 gunned down in Narayanpur in a single operation.Chhattisgarh govt has been swift in following up security success with development projects. And Puwarti, the native village of dreaded Maoist commander Hidma, has come up as a symbol of Bastar's resurrection. In Nov this year, a cluster of villages near Puwarti got electricity for first time since Independence. A road is being built.A security camp, established earlier this year, proved to be a game-changer. Thanks to this camp, tricolour was raised for first time in decades in Puwarti this Republic Day.It's thus that Union home minister Amit Shah has promised that Maoists will be eradicated by March 2026.Crucially, govt seems to be winning over hearts and minds not only among Bastar's population, but also among Maoist cadres. This year has seen the highest number of surrenders in seven years - 802 cadres, carrying a combined bounty of over Rs 8.2 crore. The only time more Maoists surrendered was in 2016, when 1,210 cadres had given up arms.Govt recently revamped its rehab policy, by approving 15,000 houses for surrendered cadres and victims of Naxal violence, and including a skill development stipend of Rs 10,000 per month.""The year 2024 was significant for troops in Bastar range on all fronts. We made vital inroads even in those areas that were considered to be impenetrable Maoist strongholds. Unprecedented breakthroughs in Abujhmarh and south Bastar have not only boosted the morale of security forces but also given a hope to the native population that the Naxal menace would come to an end sooner than expected. It is not only the numerical counts of the Naxal dead bodies recovered, but also the grade of the cadres, like state committee-level cadres, who got removed from the Naxal ecosystem that has provided us the operational edge in this season,"" Bastar Range IG P Sundarraj told TOI.""Increasing our operational and development reach in otherwise deprived parts of south Bastar, west Bastar and Maad region have turned the tables. Providing basic amenities like PDS shops, anganwadi, centres and household electrification in villages has bridged the development deficit and increased the trust between the native population and govt. We are hopeful of much better outcomes in the forthcoming season,"" he added.The solution to Naxal insurgency is being executed from three directions - development, intensified operations and surrenders. The fourth dimension is missing this far - peace talks. CM Sai and state home minister Vijay Sharma had hinted at talks with Maoists earlier in the year, but there is no sign of it being formalised.Some officials said with nearly 20 Maoists being eliminated on average every month, govt doesn't need to get into peace talks, but there are already cries from Bastar that the sustained military campaign is leading to bloodshed of the innocent.Maoists are venting out their fury at civilians, killing even teachers, women and children in ever-increasing savagery. Less than a fortnight ago, at least four children were injured in ""crossfire"" during an encounter in Abujhmarh. One of them, a 16-year-old, had a bullet lodged in her throat. Her father claims she was shot by police.There have been repeated allegations that police ended up killing innocent villagers as Maoists. So far, Sai govt hasn't faced the kind of protests that erupted from time to time during the tenures of BJP's Raman Singh and Congress's Bhupesh Baghel. Perhaps it helps that Sai is a tribal and understands Bastar better. Perhaps it's fitting that Bastar's new chapter will be written by a tribal.","At least 222 Maoists have been gunned down by security forces in Bastar since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took over.

2025 likely to be one of the 3 warmest years on record: WMO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-likely-to-be-one-of-the-3-warmest-years-on-record-wmo/articleshow/116812269.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on Monday warned that the record-breaking temperatures of 2024 will likely continue next year with the greenhouse gas (GHG) levels growing to record “observed highs, locking in even more heat for the future”.The warning factored in the UK Met office outlook for 2025, suggesting that it is likely to be one of the three warmest years for global average temperature, falling in line just behind 2024 and 2023.It has already been observed by the WMO that 2024 is set to be the warmest year on record, now almost certain to exceed the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degree C in 2023, the previous warmest year on record.“Today I can officially report that we have just endured a decade of deadly heat. The top ten hottest years on record have happened in the last ten years, including 2024,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres in his New Year message on Monday.Referring to the WMO’s observation that 2015-2024 will be the warmest ten years on record, Guterres said, “This is climate breakdown — in real time. We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose. In 2025, countries must put the world on a safer path by dramatically slashing emissions, and supporting the transition to a renewable future”.As global temperatures rise and extreme heat events become more frequent and severe, the WMO also stressed the growing need for enhanced international cooperation to address extreme heat risks.Referring to a new report from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, it noted that climate change intensified 26 of the 29 extreme weather events that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions in 2024.“Every fraction of a degree of warming matters, and increases climate extremes, impacts and risks. Temperatures are only part of the picture. Climate change plays out before our eyes on an almost daily basis in the form of increased occurrence and impact of extreme weather events,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.The global met body, however, time and again clarified that one or more individual years exceeding 1.5 degree C does not necessarily mean that “pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels” as stated in the Paris Agreement is out of reach.“The exceedance of warming levels referred to in the Paris Agreement should be understood as an exceedance over an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition,” the WMO said.","The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned that the record-breaking temperatures of 2024 will likely continue next year. The warning factored in the UK Met office outlook for 2025, suggesting that it is likely to be one of the three warmest years for global average temperature.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116812329,imgsize-456623,width-400,resizemode-4/116812329.jpg"

BATHINDA: A nine-hour shutdown called by farmers' unions fighting for a legally guaranteed minimum support price mechanism for crops struck Punjab off the transport map Monday, with buses going off the road and 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.Thousands of stranded passengers spent the day at railway stations without functioning food stalls, while those who picked alternative transport ran into roadblocks at various places.SKM (non-political) and KMM had called for a shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm, barring even supply of milk and vegetables. Emergency services were exempted.Altercations between protesters and travellers inconvenienced by the strike were reported at some locations. A cancer patient from Gujarat and his wife were stranded at Ferozepur railway station en route Dharamshala in Himachal. The man's wife said she didn't find an eatery or a stall open to buy food, let alone give her husband the diet he has been medically advised to follow.In Faridkot, protesters allegedly abused and threatened primary block education officer Jagtar Singh for keeping his office open.Farm activist Sarvan Singh Pandher said organisations enforcing the strike had sought public support and people of the state spontaneously responded to it, making the bandh ""complete and peaceful"".Fellow activists Kaka Singh Kotda and Surjit Singh Phool said senior members of the farm lobby stayed put at Khanauri border protest site on Punjab-Haryana border as they were worried about safety of fasting farmer Jagjit Singh Dallewal.Punjab administration made another futile attempt at convincing the farmer to receive medical assistance ahead of Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the matter.Retired additional DGP Jaskaran Singh, accompanied by DIG (Patiala range) Mandeep Singh Sidhu and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh, held a series of meetings with farm activists at Khanauri since Sunday. Jaskaran Singh also met Dallewal. The latter only agreed to give blood samples for testing.In a short video after the strike ended, Dallewal thanked people of Punjab for backing the bandh. He also expressed gratitude to the volunteers by his side.Amid calls for unity till farm unions' demands are accepted, rival factions announced parallel kisan mahapanchayats on Jan 4 at two venues 27km apart. The events underscore the rift that some farm activists fear has weakened the movement that gained nationwide traction in 2020-21.SKM plans to hold its mahapanchayat at Tohana in Haryana, while the other two groups, SKM (non-Political) and KMM, will gather at Khanauri. Dallewal is expected to address the second event.",Farmers' unions called for nine-hour shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm. 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.

This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Monday issued clarification on BJP's allegations that the top party leaders did not accompany the family for immersion of the ashes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.""Senior Congress leaders did not accompany the family to gather and immerse the ashes of Manmohan Singh ji out of our deference to the privacy of the family,"" AICC's media and publicity chairperson Pawan Khera said in a statement released on Monday.The statement further read, ""After the cremation of our beloved departed leader, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the family at their residence.""""After discussing with them, it was felt that since the family did not get any privacy at the time of the cremation and some extended family members could not reach the pyre site, it would be appropriate to give them some privacy for the Phool Chunana and the immersion of the ashes which is an emotionally painful and difficult ceremony for close family members,"" the statement added.The ashes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were immersed in the Yamuna River near the Majnu ka Tila Gurdwara on Sunday by his family members, following Sikh rituals.Singh’s ashes were collected from the Nigambodh Ghat on Sunday morning and taken to the 'Asth Ghat' on the Yamuna River bank near the gurdwara for immersion.His wife, Gursharan Kaur, and their three daughters—Upinder Singh, Daman Singh, and Amrit Singh—were present at the ceremony along with other relatives.However, the BJP criticized the absence of members of the Gandhi family during the immersion. ""Very sad to see that not a single member of Congress or the Gandhi family showed up to collect the remains of Manmohan Singh ji. For media attention and to politicise, Congress was present, but when it came to honouring him with dignity, they were absent. Truly shameful,"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X.BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, ""It’s a sad moment for all of us. However, it’s true that no one was there from the Gandhi family today (during the immersion of Singh's ashes). Today, when there was no camera, there was no one from Congress. This is a sad thing. Manmohan Singh is highly respected.""BJP's Manjinder Singh Sirsa was seen along with Manmohan Singh's family members collecting his remains.Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh passed away at AIIMS Delhi on December 26 due to age-related medical complications. He was 92.","AICC's media and publicity chairperson Pawan Khera said in a statement released on Monday.

"Isro launches space docking satellites, India on path to elite club; PSLV last stage has 24 payloads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-launches-space-docking-satellites-india-on-path-to-elite-club-pslv-last-stage-has-24-payloads/articleshow/116805228.cms,"24 POEM Payloads

India on Monday got a step closer to becoming part of an elite group of nations with space-docking technology — ability to mate two spacecraft in space — with Isro ’s putting two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.The satellites, part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, lifted off around little past 10pm on the PSLV-C60 from the first launchpad at the spaceport in Sriharikota. They were placed in a 475-km circular orbit some 15 minutes later. The first of the two satellites was separated 15.1 minutes after lift off, and the other happened at 15.2 minutes.As per M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), the satellites — ‘chaser’ and ‘target’ spacecraft — launched separately will initially be released with a small relative velocity between them.As reported by TOI earlier, the satellites, through a series of carefully choreographed manoeuvres, will distance from each other over the next few days before Isro attempts to dock them. If Isro manages this successfully, India would have taken the first serious step towards mastering the technology, something only the US, Russia and China boast of as on date.“The rocket has placed the satellite in the right orbit. The satellites moved one behind the other. Their distance will increase to about 20km over the next few days before we close the gap and attempt the docking. We’re hoping to complete docking in the coming week. The nominal date for this is Jan 7,” Isro chairman S Somanath said soon after the launch.The mission is crucial for India’s future space endeavors includingChandrayaan-4 and the planned Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS), as confirmed by Isro chairman S Somanath.In addition to the primary docking experiment, the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carried 24 innovative payloads, including several groundbreaking experiments: India’s first astrobiology payloads are among the highlights, featuring RV College of Engineering’s microbiological experiment studying gut bacteria behavior in space, and Amity University's investigation of spinach growth in microgravity.Isro is also launching its own CROPS (Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies) payload to demonstrate seed germination in space, a robotic arm designed to capture space debris and a sophisticated inter-satellite communication system. Isro will demonstrate a unique “walking” robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom, intended for future space station operations.The private sector has also sent payloads on POEM: PierSight, an Ahmedabad-based startup, launched Varuna, a precursor to what could be India’s first private Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite for maritime surveillance. The company aims to establish a 32-satellite constellation by 2028 for comprehensive ocean monitoring.The other payloads are Mumbai-based Manastu and Bengaluru’s Bellatrix Aerospace, both testing their respective green propulsion technologies, while GalaxEye from Bengaluru is showcasing their SAR signal processing technology and TakeMe2Space from Hyderabad is demonstrating nanosatellite subsystems.Other educational institutions participating include SJC Institute of Technology and MIT World Peace University. SJC from Karnataka is sending a multimode message transmitter payload that can transmit audio, text, and image messages from a satellite to the ground using FM modulation and the VHF band. It is designed to provide amateur radio satellite services globally. It was designed in collaboration with Isro’s URSC.","Isro has launched two small satellites weighing 220 kg each.

NEW DELHI: Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena on Monday wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'.""I found it deeply objectionable and was personally hurt when your predecessor, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, recently declared you in the media as merely a temporary and stopgap Chief Minister,"" said the LG in his letter. ""It was not only an insult to you, but also to your appointee, the President of India and to me as her representative,"" he added.Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis. It is also a deplorable violation of the democratic spirit and values enshrined in the Constitution authored by Babasaheb Ambedkar.""The LG lauded Atishi for her approach in governance, contrasting it with her predecessor's alleged reluctance to take on administrative responsibilities. “For the first time during my tenure, I have seen a Chief Minister actively performing the duties of the office,” he wrote.The LG further outlined the challenges faced by the Delhi government, including the Yamuna pollution crisis , garbage management, and the poor state of infrastructure in industrial and slum areas. ""It is well known under what circumstances you were made Chief Minister. Whether it be the worsening state of the Yamuna over the past ten years, the severe shortage of drinking water, the issue of garbage mountains, the lack of basic amenities in industrial areas, the disrepair of roads and sewer lines, the crumbling healthcare system, the dire lack of facilities in unauthorized colonies, or the abysmal living conditions in slum areas—everyone understands how impossible it is for a Chief Minister, already declared temporary and stopgap, to address these issues in three to four months,"" the LG said adding, ""as chief minister, the responsibility for these failures will now rest on your shoulders"".The letter also took aim at Kejriwal for making unilateral announcements on government schemes during public events claiming, “Unauthorized announcements such as schemes for senior citizens and women have undermined the dignity of the chief minister’s office and the Cabinet.”Additionally, the LG condemned Kejriwal’s claims of alleged investigations against Atishi, including suggestions that she could face jail time. He referred to official communications from the Transport Department and the Vigilance Department, which have categorically denied any such probes, calling Kejriwal’s allegations ""baseless and misleading"".The letter also saw LG expressing his concern about the level of political discourse in the capital. “I am concerned about the level of public discourse and am deeply hurt by the narrative presenting the full-time chief minister of my government as a temporary Chief Minister,” he wrote.Atishi responded to the letter letter with a sharp critique, urging him to prioritise governance over politics. ""It is a testimony to the democratic principles of our country that all elected members of the government are in fact temporary and remain in office only till the duration of their term. I am amused by you taking offence at any statement highlighting this reality of an active democracy,"" she said.Addressing the LG, she added, ""As the Lieutenant Governor, though a nominated member, you are also a part of the Delhi government. It is disheartening to note that your letter focuses on criticism rather than constructive cooperation. I strongly believe that governance should remain above petty politics, and I urge you to work alongside us in this spirit.""She defended the legacy of her predecessor, Arvind Kejriwal, stating that his governance model has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. ""The elected government led by the former CM Shri Arvind Kejriwal managed to do more work in its tenure of nine and a half years than collectively done by the previous governments. I respectfully request your office to play a facilitative role rather than one that creates impediments,"" she said. Further praising Kejriwal the Delhi CM added, ""The current work of the Delhi government is deeply rooted in the vision and legacy of former Chief Minister Shri Arvind Kejriwal. Be it the educational reforms, healthcare revolution, or infrastructural advancements, his model of governance has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. The progress we are making today is a continuation of this legacy, and we remain committed to fulfilling this vision.""Accusing the LG of being aligned with BJP, she claimed, ""It is evident that the office of the Lieutenant Governor is now working as a proxy of the BJP, and in its enthusiasm to protect the interest of the BJP, is causing damage to the lives of ordinary Delhites,""adding that she ""do not see how anyone can be so caught up in politics that they do not care for the people at all.""Atishi then called for for a collective effort to respect the people's mandate and work towards the betterment of Delhi. She expressed hope that 2025 would mark a shift towards constructive governance, leaving behind the ""baggage of politics.""","Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116801892,imgsize-1072624,width-400,resizemode-4/116801892.jpg"

The reason is to pay respect to mothers and sisters.""After the chief minister 's statement, Kolkata Municipal Corporation held an urgent meeting and issued a formal notification. ""We have instructed our officials to do whatever is necessary to honour the legendary actor whose contribution to Bengali theatre has been immense,"" the mayor said.Over the centuries, Kolkata has housed two Star Theatres. One was situated at Beadon Street and the other at Cornwallis Street (now Bidhan Sarani). ""Girish Chandra Ghosh had persuaded Bindoni Dasi to be Gurmook Roy's mistress since that would ensure that he funded a theatre on Beadon Street. She consented.

""The theatre changed its name to Emerald, Kohinoor and Manmohan Theatre before being finally demolished in 1931 by the British govt when the Central Avenue was extended,"" said Basu. This existing Star Theatre, which is being renamed, stands on Bidhan Sarani and was built in Dec 1887.Actor Sudipta Chakraborty, who portrays Binodini in Abanti Chakraborty's play 'Binodini Opera', said: ""In the play, Binodini questions the logic behind refusing to name the theatre after her fearing audience opposition, even when people turn up in huge number to watch her perform. For two years, during every performance of our play, the audience has agreed when we asked them if the Star Theatre should be named after Binodini. Today's move is a triumph for our campaign.

Land allotment for Manmohan Singh's memorial after registration of Trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-allotment-for-manmohan-singhs-memorial-after-registration-of-trust/articleshow/116809635.cms,"(PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: It will take some more days for the government to allot land for former PM Manmohan Singh’s memorial as spaces for construction of a memorial can be only given to a trust, which in this case is yet to be established, sources said. They added that even in the case of a memorial for former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, land was allotted to the Atal Samiti Nyas (Trust), which was registered more than a month after his death.The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.Sources said some preliminary assessment of available land parcels in the Rajghat area is being carried out for Manmohan Singh’s memorial. “It will take some more days as the trust, which is yet to be established, needs to apply for the land,” a source said.A member of the Atal Samiti Nyas, which built the Sadaiv Atal (the samadhi and memorial of Vajpayee), recalled that after the demise of the former PM, the trust was established. “We applied for land, and subsequently, an MoU was signed with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The design of the samadhi was made by the School of Planning and Architecture. The trust released fund for construction to the CPWD,” the member said.Vajpayee’s memorial is spread over 1.5 acres of land at the Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, where he was cremated on Aug 17, 2018. “Because of a change in policy, the land was allotted only to the trust,” the member said.TOI has learnt that the government is now looking at options to zero down on one to 1.5 acre land in the areas meant for memorials around Raj Ghat for Singh. They added that it takes at least four to five days for registration of a trust.Sources in Congress said they have no fresh update on the memorial.At present, there are 19 memorials in and around the Rajghat complex, which includes that of former presidents, PMs and deputy PMs. The two exceptions are Sanjay Gandhi and Lalita Shastri, the late wife of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.","The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.

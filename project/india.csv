Today I would like to inform the people of Jharkhand that by putting an end to appeasement politics, the BJP will drive out infiltrators and rebuild Jharkhand from scratch,"" he had said.Soren also accused the BJP of dividing society along lines of caste, creed, and religion.

INS Vikrant fraud case: 2nd closure report against BJP neta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ins-vikrant-fraud-case-2nd-closure-report-against-bjp-neta/articleshow/114927075.cms,"MUMBAI: More than two months after a court refused to accept Mumbai economic offences wing's ( EOW ) 2022 report closing the case against senior BJP functionary Kirit Somaiya and his son, Neil, for allegedly misappropriating Rs 57 crore collected to save INS Vikrant from being dismantled, police have filed another closure report, effectively giving them a clean chit, reports Ahmed Ali.The FIR had alleged that the amount collected in 2013-14 via a fundraising drive by the Somaiyas and their associates was supposed to be handed over to the governor but a letter from Raj Bhavan said it had received no money. In Aug, a magistrate's court had observed that the investigating officer had not probed what Somaiya and Neil had done with the donations and had ordered further investigation. INS Vikrant was the Navy's first aircraft carrier to be dismantled.In its fresh closure report, the 'C summary report', EOW said Rs 12,881 was raised during the drive outside Churchgate station, and that there was no concrete evidence of substantial fund transfers or more collection drives elsewhere in Mumbai. Witnesses provided conflicting accounts regarding the dates and amounts collected, police claimed.The report said given the duration and location of the fundraising event, it appeared improbable Rs 57 crore could have been raised. It also noted the absence of third-party records to verify donor claims. As a result, it said, investigators could not corroborate the conduct of a significant collection drive beyond the modest sums collected publicly.EOW concluded that absence of concrete evidence, combined with lack of substantial witness testimony, pointed towards no criminal intent. It highlighted the fundraising drive appeared to have been a symbolic public awareness campaign, rather than a substantial financial endeavour.","Kirit Somaiya and his son, Neil, were accused of misappropriating Rs 57 crore collected to save INS Vikrant from being dismantled.

'Other steps could happen': EAM Jaishankar on India-China ties after LAC disengagement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/other-steps-could-happen-eam-jaishankar-on-india-china-ties-after-lac-disengagement/articleshow/114914401.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar said Sunday that India and China have made “some progress” in disengaging along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), calling it a “welcome” move that could lead to further positive steps in the relationship. His remarks come after Indian and Chinese troops recently completed disengagement at two major friction points-Demchok and Depsang Plains-in eastern Ladakh.The minister said that following a recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia, plans were set for further discussions involving India’s national security advisor and the foreign ministry . “So that’s where things are,” he noted, adding that the disengagement “opens up the possibility that other steps could happen.”“In terms of India and China, yes, we have made some progress,” Jaishankar said during an interaction with the Indian diaspora in Brisbane. “Our relations were very, very disturbed for reasons all of you know. We have made some progress in what we call disengagement, which is when troops were very close to each other, with the possibility that could lead to some untoward incident.”The disengagement process, which saw Indian forces beginning verification patrolling at Depsang and Demchok on Friday, is seen as a significant step towards resolving lingering border issues from the 2020 standoff. The LAC had seen large deployments of Chinese troops, a move countered by India, and this increase in forces on both sides contributed to heightened tensions.“There are very large numbers of Chinese troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control who were not there before 2020. And we, in turn, have counter-deployed,” Jaishankar added.This new agreement on patrolling and disengagement was formalised after several rounds of talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had earlier said, marking a potential breakthrough to end the four-year standoff along the LAC. The Galwan Valley clash in June 2020 had deeply strained relations between the two countries, making disengagement and talks essential steps in normalising ties.Jaishankar, in Brisbane on the first leg of a two-nation tour, also addressed global issues, including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, expressing concern over their impact on global stability. Highlighting India’s role in promoting diplomacy, he said Prime Minister Modi had been actively involved in discussions with leaders of Russia and Ukraine. “We are trying to do something in both,” Jaishankar stated, emphasising India’s commitment to a diplomatic resolution in both regions.On the Middle East, he said that India is attempting to prevent further escalation of tensions, pointing out the challenges in mediating between Iran and Israel due to a lack of direct communication. “At the moment, the effort is more to prevent the conflict from spreading,” he said, hinting at India’s involvement without divulging specific details.Touching upon the Quad alliance , Jaishankar explained that the grouping of India, Australia, Japan, and the United States is focused on a broad agenda that includes maritime security, connectivity, and climate forecasting, among other areas. “You have four democracies, four market economies, four countries with a strong record of global contributions,” he said, underscoring the Quad’s broader purpose.During his Australian visit, Jaishankar will inaugurate India’s fourth consulate in the country and co-chair the 15th Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in Canberra.","India and China have made “some progress” in disengaging along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), External affairs minister S Jaishankar said.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode. Following the vibrant Diwali festivities on October 31, students enjoy a series of significant religious holidays in early November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also signal a shift towards the academic season’s end. November marks the beginning of the pre-exam period for students, with upcoming term-end exams and the first round of dates for major entrance exams, such as the JEE, announced.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November-Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students transition from the festive season to exam season.

"BJP’s ‘secular’ allies Naidu, Nitish must not allow Waqf Bill to be passed in Parliament: Jamiat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-secular-allies-naidu-nitish-must-not-allow-waqf-bill-to-be-passed-in-parliament-jamiat/articleshow/114918505.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA allies — TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar — should take note of Muslim sentiments and not allow the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 to be passed in Parliament, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said Sunday, stepping up its campaign against the passage of the proposed legislation, which is at present under the scrutiny of a Joint Parliamentary Committee.Adopting a resolution at the “Save The Constitution” convention held at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in the Capital, JUH appealed to the “parties within the NDA that claim to be secular to distance themselves from supporting this dangerous proposed bill and to prove their secular credentials”. JUH said that it supports the stance of opposition parties regarding the proposed Bill.Incidentally, the JPC on the Waqf bill will be meeting for another round of meetings for two days starting Monday.Calling the two allies -TDP and JD(U) as “crutches” that the BJP led NDA govt at the Centre was dependent on for staying in power, Maulana Arshad Madani, chief of the one of the factions of the JUH that led the Convention, cautioned that if the Waqf Bill is passed ignoring the sentiments of the Muslims - “it will be as much a responsibility of the crutches as it would be of those calling the shots in the Central govt. Both the TDP and JD(U) will not be able to escape responsibility.”“People did not give the BJP the required mandate in the Lok Sabha elections to form a govt on its own as they did not accept their policies. However, the BJP led govt that is running the show today is dependent on two crutches - its allies - TDP and JD(U). Without them the BJP would not have been able to form govt.”Sharing that he had invited N Chandrababu Naidu for the convention, Madani acknowledged that even though he did not come the TDP chief sent his party’s vice president Nawab Jan. “I perceive this to be a positive sign as he is Naidu’s representative and will convey the message of all those present at the Convention,” Madani said.The JUH chief shared that as part of its outreach on the issue, Jamiat has decided to hold a public meeting in December, in Andhra Pradesh where they will bring together around five lakh Muslims to put forth the concerns of the Muslims.Attended by clerics and scholars from prominent Muslim organisations including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the JUH passed a resolution at the convention, where it rejected the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2024 and demanded that it be withdrawn by the govt. They also sought that the existing law - Waqf Act 2013 be retained as it is.“No individual from any other religion be included in the Waqf Board, and that the JPC be bound to consult only Muslims, Muslim organizations, and Muslim leaders,” the resolution asserts.“If the bill is passed, the board will become powerless, the status of the Waqf Tribunal will be abolished, and a district collector will identify Waqf with their decision being final. As a result, government control and occupation of Waqf (endowments) will become extremely easy,” the JUH resolution highlights with concern.",The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) appealed to the “parties within the NDA that claim to be secular to distance themselves from supporting this dangerous proposed bill” The JPC on the Waqf bill will be meeting for another round of meetings for two days starting Monday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114918641,imgsize-101970,width-400,resizemode-4/114918641.jpg"

AGRA: A 14-year-old boy from Hathras in UP died hours after doctors at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital — in a complex and gruelling surgery that lasted almost five hours — removed about 65 objects , including batteries, chains, razor blade fragments and screws, from the child's stomach.“Aditya Sharma was brought to Safdarjung Hospital where doctors found all those objects in his stomach. He died due to an intestinal infection ,” said an official at the hospital on Saturday, adding, “He must have swallowed these objects in the past”. His father, Sanchet Sharma, a medical representative at a pharma firm in Hathras, said Aditya started complaining of shortness of breath and discomfort on Oct 13, prompting a visit to a hospital in Agra. His parents, in the next two weeks, took him to medical facilities in four cities — Jaipur, Aligarh, Noida and Delhi — with the hope of a proper diagnosis and cure. “But Aditya died on the night of Oct 28. All of this happened within a month... He never had any physical or mental ailments in the past,” said Sharma, who lives in Ratnagarbha colony.Aditya was Sharma’s only son. After their visit to the Agra hospital, the Class 9 student was referred to a hospital in Jaipur where following scans and tests he came back to UP on Oct 19. Two days later, Aditya’s breathing difficulties resurfaced and his parents rushed him to a hospital in Aligarh. There, a CT scan found a “nasal blockage”, which the doctors successfully removed, Sharma said.“However, Aditya started having abdominal pain and on Oct 26 after an extensive ultrasound test in Aligarh, it was found that there were 19 objects stuck inside his stomach. He was immediately referred to a private hospital in Noida, and we took him there the same day. In Noida, doctors found 42 objects in the stomach and called for urgent medical attention,” he added. Aditya was subsequently moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where a scan identified a “total of 65 objects”, and the boy’s “heart beat raced up to 280 per minute”, the family said.","Aditya Sharma was brought to Safdarjung Hospital where doctors found all those objects in his stomach.

When PM Modi questioned EAM on India-Australia ties. Jaishankar shares story in Brisbane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-pm-modi-asked-eam-on-india-australia-ties-jaishankar-shares-story-in-brisbane/articleshow/114912218.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday shared his views on Indo-Australian relations and discussed how the bilateral relationship between the two nations evolved, highlighting the dedicated efforts made from both countries to strengthen this partnership.Speaking to the Indian community in Brisbane , he said, “I remember an early conversation with him ( PM Modi ) in 2014. He asked me that 'explain to me why hasn't our relationship with Australia developed?' Because it has everything going for it. There is a language, share culture, tradition and yet somehow, something is not happening. That day, I did not have an answer perhaps because I myself had not reflected upon it. So, this is a reflection that this relationship did not happen on auto-pilot. People, on both ends, made great efforts to build it.”At the University of Queensland the EAM outlined the four fundamental elements that have contributed to the strengthening of bilateral ties between the two nations.""This is my fifth visit to Australia in the last three years... I first came to Australia when I was Foreign Secretary. Yesterday, before I boarded the flight, I launched a book in which they highlighted seven crucial friendships of India, Australia was one of them,"" EAM said""And I told the author; that if he had written the book 10 years ago, I am not sure it would have been. I am saying this because I am trying to stress how much this relationship has in the last decade and why has it changed... There are four reasons. One PM Modi, two Australia, three the world and fourth is all of you. That is the reason why the relationship has come a long way,"" he added.Jaishankar discussed the significance ofQUAD and Australia's foundational role in the partnership. He elaborated on the diplomatic implications of their bilateral relations.He said, “The QUAD ranks right up there and Australia is a founding partner of that mechanism in terms of our bilateral ties. In diplomacy, you come up with words that signal to your own system and to others. When we speak today of a comprehensive strategic partnership, this description has a meaning in bureaucratic terms.He highlighted the Indian presence in the region, stating that “About 125,000 people of Indian origin live here. I'm told there are roughly 15,000-16,000 students living in this state. What impressed me was that 75% of Australia's exports to India come from this state... In the last 10 years, we should not treat it as an achievement but as a glimpse of what is possible. What we have done is put in place a framework in which this relationship will grow and foster in the times to come.He further highlighted the recent developments in educational cooperation, noting, ""We have just had the visit of our Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to Australia and I do believe that education and research will play a disproportionate role in the knowledge economy and the era of AI.”Addressing the Indian diaspora , Jaishankar expressed confidence about India's trajectory and said, ""India will grow.

These developments encompass streamlined business processes, enhanced living standards, and substantial infrastructure improvements through the Gati Shakti programme .""In the last 10 years, we believe we have made very significant progress and I would attribute the progress to the fact that we have embarked on a series of efforts which feed into each other, making it much easier to do business in the country, improving the ease of living, radically improving the infrastructure through a program called Gati Shakti, putting in place what has been a remarkably effective digital public infrastructure, improving the quality of governance overall, ensuring the political stability which allows for decisions taken to be implemented in full and for new decisions to build on earlier ones,” he said.“Today's India is building 28 kilometers of highway every day, 12-14 kilometers of railway track every day, we had 6 cities with metros a decade ago and have 21 today, and we are planning an additional 39.

You (Hemant Soren) have given shelter to the infiltrators. You see your vote bank in the infiltrators. Due to infiltrators, the number of tribals in this state is decreasing, the demography is changing and Hemant Soren's government is busy with its own work. The number of tribals in Santhal Pargana is continuously decreasing.”“Infiltrators are coming here and luring our daughters and marrying them and occupying the land. If this is not stopped, then neither the culture of Jharkhand, nor the employment, land, or daughters here will be safe. BJP government is being formed in Jharkhand and we will drive out these infiltrators,"" Shah added.Home minister further criticised Soren’s handling of security, particularly for women, vowing that a BJP government would prioritize protection and reclaim land taken from women. “In Assam, after the BJP took charge, infiltration has stopped. We will bring the same commitment here to protect roti (livelihood), beti (daughters), and maati (land),” Shah said.Turning his attention to West Bengal, Shah argued that infiltration remains an issue there due to local administrative support for such activities. He expressed confidence that with a BJP government in Jharkhand, all levels of authority would work together to curb infiltration and deport illegal residents.In addition to security concerns, Shah also commented on an ongoing controversy surrounding Soren's age, urging the chief minister to clarify discrepancies in his affidavit.""It is his moral responsibility to be truthful with the people,"" Shah said, highlighting that the BJP alleges Soren’s age has increased by seven years over a five-year period—his age reportedly shifting from 42 in 2019 to 49 in his current affidavit.","Union home minister Amit Shah issued a stark warning about the consequences for those who commit heinous acts against women.

BJP manifesto a bid to wean tribal voters from JMM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-manifesto-a-bid-to-wean-tribal-voters-from-jmm/articleshow/114926324.cms,"BJP has revised its strategy since the 2019 election, which the party lost by a significant margin

NEW DELHI: BJP's manifesto for the Jharkhand assembly polls , unveiled by home minister Amit Shah , reflects the party's hardline stance against infiltration and is also a bid to prevent consolidation of tribals in favour of CM and JMM boss Hemant Soren who has tried to whip up sympathy against his arrest in a land scam case.The manifesto also ties in with PM Narendra Modi's mantra of 'ek rahenge to safe rahenge'. The slogan 'Mati, Beti, Roti' (land, daughter, bread) alludes to the threat from illegal immigrants and fears about demographic change, which BJP strategists believe could mobilise voters in its favour.The infiltration issue has been raised by top party netas during their visits, with the expectation that it will become a central campaign theme.BJP has also aimed to reshape its image from a development-focused party to one that respects and understands Jharkhand's socio-cultural fabric.The party's commitment to implementing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), while exempting tribal communities, might appeal to those seeking legal uniformity but could also spark controversy among tribes and other groups resistant to such changes, potentially dividing voters along cultural lines.Promises to rehabilitate those displaced by industrial and mining activities could resonate with affected communities, offering a concrete promise of welfare and justice. This could influence voting in areas where displacement has been a major concern, demonstrating BJP's intent to address historical injustices.The pledge to investigate exam paper leaks and punish those responsible could be a strategic move to appeal to the youth and educational sector, often marginalised in state politics. This might win over voters disillusioned with the ""lapses"" witnessed during the Hemant Soren dispensation.Party functionaries have also revised their strategy since the 2019 election, which they lost by a significant margin. While the 2019 manifesto touched on tribal issues, the current approach of explicitly exempting tribals from the UCC shows a more direct, nuanced engagement with tribal politics, perhaps rectifying past oversights.The intensified focus on deporting illegal immigrants and countering infiltrators, not as prominent as in 2019, indicates BJP's adaptation to the evolving political discourse in Jharkhand, where national security and demographic changes are increasingly central.","BJP's manifesto for the Jharkhand assembly polls reflects the party's hardline stance against infiltration.

HYDERABAD: Even as security forces push hard into the forests of Chhattisgarh to smoke out the last Naxal strongholds, a number of surrendered cadres in neighbouring Telangana say they have received a raw deal from government. They say they are happy to have ended a life of playing hide and seek . But since laying down their arms, government officials have started playing hide and seek with them each time they ask for help.A big grouse the surrendered Naxals have is that they have not been given agricultural land . Farming is the only skill they have and in the absence of land, they have been reduced to doing odd jobs.Meet Saralamma (name changed), who was once with the banned CPI (M), as a divisional committee member (DCM) and was married to a prominent Central Committee (CC) member (who died of Covid). She had herself lost an eye in a shootout with security forces. Saralamma surrendered in 2021 after 27 years as a Maoist in the hope of turning her life around. Three years on, she has been forced to become an agriculture labourer and says she is tired of making rounds to various officials in Mahabubabad seeking a residential plot and an acre of agricultural land .""I am not even given widow pension. When I applied, district authorities asked me to produce my husband's death certificate when the world knew he died in the Chhattisgarh forests working for Maoists. How can I get the death certificate?"" she asks.Police officials promptly pay reward money as soon as Maoist cadres surrender. But most of those who TOI spoke to said that after being handed the cheque, they were left to fend for themselves. Many suffer health problems.Venkatesham (name changed), a former DCM from Mahabubabad and now a gig worker delivering food in Hyderabad, says he gets a cold response from officials whenever he asks them about the farmland he was promised . ""They make us wait for hours. And the stock reply we get is: there is no govt land to spare. I feel let down. For the sake of my wife and children, I have shifted to Hyderabad,"" he says.The surrendered Naxals blame revenue officials for playing truant. Till 2018, there have been instances of former Naxals managing to get hold of a piece of land but since then their requests for sanction of govt land have fallen on the deaf ears of officials, they claim. Some tried their luck by getting in touch with political leaders, but with little success.Revenue officials claimed they treat each surrendered Maoist separately and decide the package accordingly. ""The relief and rehabilitation issue is dealt with at the collectorate level. But one should also remember that land has become dearer with steep rise in prices,"" a senior official said.Some officials point out the assignment committee does not exist anymore. On alleged apathy of tahsildars and making surrendered Naxals run from pillar to post around govt offices, a top official said: ""If there are any specific cases, we will get them verified.""","A number of surrendered Naxals in Telangana say they have received a raw deal from government.

NEW DELHI: India’s last-minute intervention to protect sovereign rights through changes in final text could manage a groundbreaking agreement on the operationalisation of a new global mechanism to share benefits from digital genetic information at 16th session of UN biodiversity summit ( COP16 ) in Cali, Colombia, even as the biennial meet failed to reach consensus on the creation of a new global biodiversity fund on Saturday.The countries also agreed on an expanded role of indigenous people and local communities in saving biodiversity — another important takeaway from COP16 that had to be suspended due to lack of quorum in its final plenary that continued for 12 hours without decision on setting up the fund to support biodiversity initiatives globally.Observers noted that the quorum could not be reached as the session ran into extra time and members started leaving the venue to catch their respective flights back home. The COP16 was earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday. Its leftover tasks — financial mechanism (fund) and monitoring framework — now need to be revisited at a later date and new venue.The decision on the benefit sharing from uses of digital sequence information (DSI) on genetic resources “more fairly and equitably” addresses how pharmaceutical, biotechnology, animal and plant breeding and other industries benefiting from it should share those benefits with developing countries and indigenous people and local communities.Sources familiar with the final negotiations on DSI issues said India objected to the text which was meant to supersede national laws. The country asked for a clause on ensuring national ‘access and benefit sharing’ laws to be included in the annexure. The final agreement reached only when the chair agreed for New Delhi’s suggestion through consensus, they added.Besides India, other developing countries including Bolivia, Egypt and Argentina did also object to any such move that could interfere with the countries’ sovereign rights. India was represented at COP16 by a team of officials led by junior environment minister KirtiVardhan Singh.Under the agreed guidelines on the issue, large companies and other major entities benefiting commercially from DSI uses should contribute to a special fund for this purpose - called the Cali Fund - based on a percentage of their profits or revenues. The model targets larger companies most reliant on DSI. It exempts academic, public research institutions and other entities using the information but not directly benefiting.""It's a kind of agreement which will ensure that those who profit from biodiversity should now give back to nature, countries and communities. India has already notified rules under its existing domestic law on fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources and knowledge,"" said an official here.Though contributions to 'Cali Fund' will be non-binding (voluntary) where beneficiaries are expected to contribute 1% of their profits or 0.1% of their revenue, it will at least ensure that the responsibility now lies with the companies to give back to countries and communities.It is learnt that the consensus on financial mechanism to implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) - a global treaty on nature like the Paris Agreement on climate - eluded over 190 participating countries as rich nations including Australia, Japan and EU nations - opposed to any new fund to meet the global biodiversity goals.The KMGBF was adopted by the countries at COP15 in Montreal in 2022 to achieve 23 biodiversity targets with an aim to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030 under the 30x30 plan (protecting 30% of the world's land and water by 2030).“From Cali, this UN Biodiversity Conference sent a powerful call to action. It has never been clearer that the implementation of the KMGBF and the Paris Agreement in a synergistic fashion will make peace with nature within reach,” said Astrid Schomaker, executive secretary, Convention on Biological Diversity.",The countries also agreed on an expanded role of indigenous people and local communities in saving biodiversity. India objected to the text which was meant to supersede national laws. The country asked for a clause on ensuring national 'access and benefit sharing' laws to be included in the annexure.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114924556,imgsize-67824,width-400,resizemode-4/114924556.jpg"

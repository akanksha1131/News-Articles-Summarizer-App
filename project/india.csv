Presently, India has emerged one of the most vibrant startup ecosystems in the world and could be the third largest ecosystem by 2024. The entrepreneurial landscape has become explosive with the number jumping from 50,000 in 2018 to over 140,000 in 2024 and has been spurred by innovative ideas, flows of investment, and a considerable pool of talent that is currently changing the country into one of the global hubs of entrepreneurship. As the Hurun India 2024 on Self-Made Entrepreneurs of the Millennia, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Gurugram are now considered to be the center for entrepreneurial activities.Hence, these three cities listed above are the major success and prized startups found in India, which are crucial for the country's progress. Bengaluru is known as the ""Silicon Valley of India"" because most entrepreneurs and innovation companies in the region cluster around this place. Mumbai is close to it since it is the financial capital of India. Hence, good access to capital along with an excellent business ecosystem can be availed here. Thus, this diverse nature of startup clusters makes Gurugram a fast developing technology and business-friendly city relative to the recent period. This blossoming ecosystem is transformed not only in the formation of the Indian economy but in the ranking given the position this country has taken within a list of innovative countries at worldwide level.India's startup ecosystem has witnessed a meteoric rise in the recent past, and the country has been ranked as the world's third-largest startup ecosystem in 2024. Hurun India's 2024 report on Self-Made Entrepreneurs of the Millennia has ranked cities based on the number of successful, self-made entrepreneurs leading significant startups. This ranking highlights the cities that have become hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship, making a substantial contribution to India's growth as an economic powerhouse.Bengaluru is generally considered the ""Silicon Valley"" of India and undisputed leader of the startup ecosystem of the country. There are 98 entrepreneurs and 66 of the most noted companies here that have established their signature in Bengaluru. Most have credited the origin to be here when India has come up with its most successful technology ventures. There is an entrepreneurial spirit that this status provides as the city ranks as a world hub in technology.Bengaluru is home to one of the biggest and most innovative companies in India, which happens to be Zerodha- the country's leading stock brokerage platform, spearheaded by its founders Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath.It has deep talent pools of engineers, IT professionals, and software developers. Because of this, it remains one of the most alluring destinations for tech startups. Moreover, Bengaluru is associated with an active venture capital network, which helps the sustenance of many companies there. Its infrastructure, connectivity, and access to various resources make it the highest destination for entrepreneurs in the country.Mumbai is the financial hub of India and one of the major states in the entrepreneurial scenario in the country. Being at number two with 73 entrepreneurs and 36 significant companies, the business finance and industrial might have attracted Mumbai as the center. The entrepreneur who has created Avenue Supermarts or DMart, Radhakishan Damani, has made this city the retail and e-commerce start-up hub.It has good financial infrastructure and attracts capital and resources to the startup sector of retail, fintech, and entertainment, bringing together a very broad market with an international financial hub with great infrastructure, one of the top contenders in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of India.Gurugram is one other important city, as a hub located close to New Delhi, which features 34 entrepreneurs and 31 prominent companies. The hub has emerged as one of the most significant business cities and tech with an accommodation for industries in every e-commerce and fintech company among other IT services. Among the notable companies established there, is Zomato-a popular food delivery application-by Deepinder Goyal.Gurugram is a major business destination because the city is just a stone's throw from New Delhi, so administrative and business resources in the national capital are instantly accessible. Modern infrastructure that comprises IT parks, office spaces, and coworking hubs has helped it evolve into an innovation center.New Delhi is the capital city of India and placed fourth with 51 entrepreneurs and 15 notable companies. New Delhi-based entrepreneurs include Vijay Shekhar Sharma who founded Paytm. Paytm is one of India's biggest fintech firms offering wallets and payment options.Delhi is the buoyant entrepreneurial ecosystem and especially in the fintech, edtech, and e-commerce segments. When talking about infrastructure and its closeness to governmental institutions, Delhi offers networking opportunities, influences policy, and access to funding for any start-up, and hence New Delhi shall remain an element which shall be very high as a position of India's startup culture and also boast more of self-made entrepreneurs.Chennai was an automobile and manufacturing city; it is now in the fifth position with 16 entrepreneurs and 12 notable companies. Entrepreneurs such as Vasant Sridhar, who have founded the B2B platform OfBusiness for SMEs, have helped in diversifying the entrepreneurial profile of Chennai to be much more tech-driven and industrial startups.Chennai has an industrial base, which makes it strong with a qualified workforce, mainly in industries like automotive, information technology, and healthcare. Its entrepreneurial culture is growing and increasing day by day in areas such as fintech, software, and education.Pune is in the sixth place with 15 entrepreneurs and 7 significant companies. Pune has, over time, developed specific niches for itself in areas such as information technology, education, and e-commerce. Amongst such stalwarts of e-commerce stands Firstcry, co-founded by Supam Maheshwari, Sanket Hattimattur, and Prashant Jadhav.The city is known for its thriving startup culture, driven by its educational institutions, research centers, and tech parks. Pune has also become a destination for tech talent, which further supports its growth as a startup hub.Hyderabad ranks seventh with 11 entrepreneurs and 6 notable companies. Known for its role as a technology and pharmaceutical hub, Hyderabad is home to Nandan Reddy, co-founder of Swiggy, India's leading food delivery platform.Hyderabad's burgeoning startup ecosystem has received tremendous support from several thousand technology companies, including in the software development sector, e-commerce, and healthtech. The reason Hyderabad appeals is that its cost of living is low, talent pools are abundant, and the infrastructure is very strong.At the eighth position is Ahmedabad with 10 entrepreneurs and 6 notable companies such as Eris Lifesciences, whose CEO is Amit Bakshi. Strengths are there in manufacturing, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, which increasingly position Ahmedabad as an innovation hub. The city enjoys a favorable business climate due to low operating costs and a strong industrial infrastructure. Its growth in the startup ecosystem has been driven by ventures in industries such as healthcare, retail, and software development.With an entrepreneurial ecosystem smaller in size, Kolkata is at the ninth position with 7 entrepreneurs and 2 notable companies. Ravi Modi is from Kolkata. He founded Vedant Fashions with the Manyavar ethnic-wear brand, and Kolkata is his place. Kolkata is still in its infant stages compared to other big cities, but it has been promising especially in retail and fashion. The potential for growth lies in this city as more entrepreneurs spring up in the region.Rounding out the top 10 is Jaipur with 6 entrepreneurs and 2 notable companies, such as CarDekho, by Amit Jain and Anurag Jain. The company is a popular online portal for buying and selling cars. Although Jaipur's startup ecosystem is pretty small, in the past few years, it has indicated significant potential. The cost of doing business in this city is pretty low and it is now emerging as a hub for e-commerce and digital services.","India's startup ecosystem has witnessed a meteoric rise in the recent past.

I see no basis to hold up any further, the proposed travel.He further noted that having delayed the original departure, the mother was willing to incur additional expense to book fresh tickets to be able to travel forthwith.Justice Sundaresan declined Ponda's request to interview the child, saying the consent terms ""are loud and clear in relation to such travel""."," Bombay HC refused to further delay travel of a woman and her son, 9, to visit her parents in Singapore.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

""Be assured that they shall not last long, those who do not humble the

Pride of the enemies who defy them""

Viduthalai, a recent movie by Vetrimaaran, had the couplet above as its tag line. These ancient words of Thiruvalluvar also serve as a commentary to the theme of the movie, the eternal dance between power and resistance.The film weaves its narrative around Perumal, whose journey becomes a lens through which we examine whether ideological conviction can bring justice.The screenplay draws from Jayamohan's short story ‘Thunaivan’ ­. A young constable is accompanying his superior officer and a handcuffed prisoner -- a revolutionary leader whose hands are stained with the blood of two policemen. Through the prisoner's sardonic jokes and casual conversation, a darker truth emerges: this journey's destination is not a courtroom, but an execution ground. An encounter is the plan but will later be guised as an escape attempt by the prisoner.The narrative takes a turn as we learn the revolutionary's motive -- retribution for a police ambush that left innocent villagers dead and women violated. “I don't know the two policemen I killed,” he says. ""But I know they represented power. No agent of power will do this again. I have planted fear in them.”In the story's climactic moments, the young constable's hands tremble around his weapon, the prisoner welcomes death as an honourable exit. Butas the prisoner's body grows still, he lights a cigarette with steady hands, a symbolic passing of the torch of violence.This narrative serves as the foundation for ‘Viduthalai’, which explores revolutionary movements, their ideological underpinnings, and the complex role of police officers as instruments of power. The choice of Thiruvalluvar's couplet raises provocative questions: Who truly embodies the enemy? The police, the power structures they protect or the revolutionaries who target them.The answer perhaps lies in the universal truth that human conflict often stems from pride -- both personal and collective. When the collective pride supports power, revolutionaries emerge. There are martyrs on both sides.Warriors throughout history have sought honourable deaths at the hands of enemies. Tamil culture has long honoured such warriors through consecrated tombstones. Time's relentless march has erased many of their stories, leaving only silent stone testimonies to their courage.That, Thiruvalluvar, known for his wisdom and spiritual teachings, chose to speak in the voice of a military commander is intriguing. His words echo through the ages, resonating with Churchill's famous exhortation, ""Be ye men of valour, for it is better to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation."" This same spirit lives in countless battlefield speeches and locker room talks, where commanders or coaches synergise the energy of the team through a warrior’s call to overcome enemies.That a monk could teach the art of war should not surprise us. For in the end, war and peace are not opposites but complementary faces of humanity's eternal struggle for justice and dignity. Like the young constable in ‘Thunaivan’ we all must eventually confront the moment when our trembling hands must choose between action and acquiescence, between the peace we desire and the conflict we cannot avoid.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116719178,imgsize-41014,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116719178.jpg"

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai on Friday whipped himself several times as a mark of protest accusing the DMK government of failing to protect the students of Anna University in Chennai.Annamalai accused the DMK government and police of leaking the victim's personal details and compromising her dignity, calling it a “shameful” act that reflected the administration’s incompetence.The BJP leader, who announced on Thursday that he would forego wearing footwear until the DMK is ousted from power, criticised the lack of CCTV surveillance at the university and questioned the state’s use of the Nirbhaya fund meant for women’s safety.“The FIR itself has exposed the victim’s identity and portrayed her in a poor light. This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate. Women’s safety should not be compromised under any circumstance,” he stated, urging the middle class to rise against the DMK regime.",K Annamalai accused the DMK government and police of leaking the victim's personal details and compromising her dignity.

Congress demands memorial for Manmohan Singh; committed to building one: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-demands-memorial-for-manmohan-singh-committed-to-building-one-government/articleshow/116725340.cms,"Cremation site not befitting stature of ex-PM, says Cong

NEW DELHI: Former PM Manmohan Singh will be cremated with full state honours at Nigambodh Ghat here on the banks of Yamuna Saturday.The announcement by the home ministry triggered a controversy, with Congress saying govt did not heed its request to hold his last rites at a befitting place that could be built into a memorial to him. Congress termed the decision ""a deliberate insult to the first Sikh Prime Minister of India"".The govt said it received a request from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in the morning ""to allocate space for a memorial"" for Singh. In a press release, the home ministry said immediately after the Cabinet meeting, home minister Amit Shah communicated to Kharge ""and the family of Late Dr Manmohan Singh that the government will allocate space for the memorial. In the meanwhile cremation and other formalities can happen because a trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated to it.""Kharge spoke to the PM and later followed it up with a letter. Govt sources said during separate conversations with the PM and Shah, Kharge ""appreciated"" the point of view that a memorial site cannot be identified immediately, but Congress later chose to make charges against govt.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a late-evening statement said, ""The people of our country are simply unable to understand why govt of India could not find a location for his cremation and memorial that is befitting of his global stature, record of outstanding achievements, and exemplary service to the nation for decades.""In his letter to Modi, Kharge demanded that Singh's last rites be conducted at a place where a memorial can be built. ""I also wrote to the home minister,"" Kharge told the Congress Working Committee that met to pay homage to Singh.When Kharge explained the demand and his communication with Modi to CWC, sources said a member of the Gandhi family even suggested that the cremation could be done at Shakti Sthal or Veer Bhumi - the resting places of former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Sources said Kharge informed that the PM had referred the matter to the home minister and the message was that the issue would be looked into later.However, a govt announcement for cremation at Nigambodh Ghat later in the evening left Congress agitated, with the party viewing the decision to cremate Singh at a place where no former PM has been cremated as not befitting his stature.Govt sources said Congress was making false allegations. ""Both PM and Shah explained the issue in detail to Congress president and emphasised that govt was one with Congress and all others on building a proper memorial for former PM Singh,"" a source said.Meanwhile, Sukhbir Singh Badal of SAD claimed that the Union govt had ""declined the request Dr Manmohan Singh Ji's family for performing the funeral and last rites at a place where an appropriate and historic memorial may be built to commemorate his unparalleled services to the nation"". He added, ""This place should be Rajghat... in keeping with the settled practice and tradition followed in the past.""The Union cabinet earlier in the day decided that Singh will be accorded a state funeral on Saturday at 11.45am and a half-day holiday declared in all central govt offices and central PSUs. The home ministry said the defence ministry would make arrangements for the state funeral with full military honours.Sources said going by the decision taken by the Manmohan Singh govt in 2013, the memorial of the former PM would be built at 'Rashtriya Smriti', at the Samadhis Complex on the Yamuna bank near Rajghat where the memorial of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other former presidents and PMs have come up.An official statement issued at the time had mentioned that separate memorials constructed earlier for departed national political heads near Rajghat took up large space. ""In view of cabinet decision taken in the year 2000 that 'henceforth govt shall not develop any Samadhi for departed leaders' and the paucity of land at the Samadhis complex area, 'Rashtriya Smriti' is being developed to perform last rites of departed national political heads . The Smriti area will provide space for last rites of departed national political heads in future, besides space for a public gathering,"" it had said.Barring four - Morarji Desai, Gulzarilal Nanda who twice served as interim PM, P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh - all PMs have been cremated in the Capital.","Former PM Manmohan Singh will be cremated with full state honours at Nigambodh Ghat. Announcement by the home ministry triggered a controversy, with Congress saying govt did not heed its request to hold his last rites at a befitting place. Congress termed the decision ""a deliberate insult to the first Sikh Prime Minister of India""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116725360,imgsize-1599846,width-400,resizemode-4/116725360.jpg"
India's development priorities were key to Manmohan Singh's foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-development-priorities-were-key-to-manmohan-singhs-foreign-policy/articleshow/116726639.cms,"NEW DELHI: Manmohan Singh believed India's development priorities should shape its foreign policy and, in his own words, create a global environment conducive for India's growth. It was with this in mind that he met President George Bush in 2005 on the margins of the UNGA and asked him if the US could help India access clean energy in the face of many embargoes it had been facing since the 1998 nuclear tests. The rest, as they say, is history.India and the US went on to finalise the civil nuclear deal three years later, paving the way for a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group for India to carry out nuclear commerce without signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but, more importantly, for a seat at the global high table of diplomacy. How he overcame stiff opposition from Left parties and others, even risking his govt, is well documented. A man of conviction, Singh believed the US deal was in India's interest and it helped that Sonia Gandhi probably felt the same and backed him. Singh knew not just how hard Bush had worked for the deal but also how keen he was on having strong ties with India.This was India's chance, and he would not allow it to go abegging. The spirit behind this landmark agreement, which brought India and the US together after years of mistrust, continues to act as a guiding framework for the bilateral relationship, even as it moves on to another potentially transformational stage with the recently launched Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology.Apart from India's development priorities, there were many other factors - or more specifically five principles - that coalesced into forming Singh's foreign policy agenda.These included his firm belief in stable, long-term and mutually beneficial ties, greater integration into the world economy and a ""shared destiny"" of the Indian subcontinent that necessitated greater regional cooperation and connectivity. According to Singh, foreign policy should not just be about interests, but also values dear to Indian people. ""India's experiment of pursuing economic development within the framework of a plural, secular and liberal democracy has inspired people around the world and should continue to do so,"" the former PM said, addressing Indian ambassadors and high commissioners in 2013.While the nuclear deal with the US stood out for the message it conveyed to the world about India's arrival on the global stage, there were other significant foreign policy issues that Singh pursued with elan. Singh's handling of China, his efforts to solidify relations with Asean in the form of the 2012 strategic partnership and efforts to ramp up India's global trade and integration into the world economy to reduce poverty are also among the highlights of Singh's external focus.While PM Modi has been credited with transforming ties with the Gulf, it was Singh who launched India's Look West Policy to boost ties with the region. In fact, many of the policies India has been pursuing currently, whether related to Asean or even Quad, remain rooted in initiatives undertaken under Singh. According to former Australian PM Kevin Rudd, it was the joint response to the 2004 tsunami by the US, Australia, Japan and Indian under Singh that was at the heart of former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's efforts to launch Quad. He remains the only PM in recent decades to have come anywhere close to resolving the Kashmir issue.As a Wikileaks cable revealed in 2011, Singh confirmed to a visiting US delegation two years earlier that he and then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf had agreed through back-channel talks to a ""non-territorial solution"" to the dispute.As Musharraf had said earlier, this was a four-point peace plan that included free trade and movement across LoC, demilitarisation, maximum autonomy and joint management of the area. Singh himself did not elaborate about the contents of the so-called peace formula but told the US delegation that India and Pakistan had made great progress on the issue till early 2007, or when Musharraf started to run into trouble domestically.The Pakistani govt that followed dismissed the peace plan as a personal initiative of the former president. While Singh was often accused by the opposition of being soft on Pakistan, the former Prime Minister never travelled to the country during his 10 years in office.","Manmohan Singh believed India's development priorities should shape its foreign policy.

While govt has started the option of paying traffic challans through virtual courts, cheque-bounce cases are dealt in regular courts given the criminal nature of cases where evidence recording and witness submissions is involved.Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal recently informed in a written response in Parliament on Dec 20 that several factors lead to delay in disposal of cases related to cheque bounce, including frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing, besides lack of prescribed time frame by respective courts for disposal of various kinds of cases.""The disposal of cases in courts is contingent upon many factors, which include availability of physical infrastructure, supporting court staff, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, cooperation of stakeholders viz bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants & proper application of rules and procedures,"" he said.Given the long delay in disposal of such cases, Supreme Court had in an order dated March 10, 2021, constituted a 10-member committee to study steps that must be taken to facilitate an early disposal of cases underNegotiable Instruments Act .The committee suggested creation of de novo special negotiable instruments court. The amici curiae in the matter suggested a pilot study in five judicial districts with the highest pendency in five states (Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and UP) so that viability of the scheme can be examined.In another order of May 19, 2022, the apex court directed that the pilot study shall be conducted in the manner indicated in the said order for a duration of one year in 25 special courts, one in each of the five judicial districts which have been identified as having the highest pendency by the respective five high courts.

Key 26/11 plotter Makki dies of 'heart attack' in Lahore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/key-26/11-plotter-makki-dies-of-heart-attack-in-lahore/articleshow/116724852.cms,"NEW DELHI: A declassified document recovered from Osama bin Laden 's Abbottabad hideout described the 2008 Mumbai attack as a ""heroic Fidai operation"". A year before the attack, al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahiri made a clandestine visit to Islamabad to confer with the outfit's former leader Osama. The meeting was arranged by Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki , who died of a reported heart attack in Lahore early on Friday.Jamaat-ud-Dawa said Makki was undergoing treatment for ""high blood pressure"" at a hospital there. The perpetrator of numerous terr attacks, also brother-in-law of Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, Makki's notoriety fetched him the tag of "" global terrorist "". As the chief fundraiser for Lashkar, Makki's role was pivotal not only in orchestrating the 26/11 attacks , which claimed 166 lives. His terror rapsheet included several attacks, such as the one on Red Fort in 2000. Unlike other terrorists who like working on their own, Makki believed in forging collaborations, even with those following a different school of fanaticism.His alliances with Taliban founder Mullah Omar and other key figures in the terror hierarchy only served to amplify his agenda. Makki's meetings with al-Zawahiri, Osama and other connected intermediaries along the Af-Pak border between 2005 and 2007 laid the groundwork for a series of devastating attacks. The 2007 meeting between al-Zawahiri and Osama, orchestrated by Makki, was a chilling precursor to the horrors that would unfold in Mumbai a year later.Last year, the UN Security Council placed him on its sanctions list, prompting him to go into a life of self-imposed exile. ""As Makki, a resident of Muridke, spearheaded fundraising operations for Lashkar, he forged robust alliances with Mullah Omer, prompting the US to recognise the threat he posed. Between 2005-10, Makki convened multiple India-focused meets on the Af-Pak border with Omar, al-Zawahiri and other conduits, drawing the attention of India's external intelligence agency,"" a top intelligence officer said.Makki also cultivated a pseudonym, taught at a university in Saudi Arabia, and authored a book distinguishing fidayeen operations from suicide attacks, reads a dossier on him. Makki's reported demise brings to a close a chapter in the complex web of global terrorism, but his legacy as a mastermind of mayhem will continue to haunt.","Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki died of a reported heart attack in Lahore early on Friday.

'That is where my grandfather was killed': What Manmohan Singh said about visiting his ancestral village in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/that-is-where-my-grandfather-was-killed-what-manmohan-singh-said-about-visiting-his-ancestral-village-in-pakistan/articleshow/116720352.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh once offered a poignant response when asked whether he would return to his ancestral village in Pakistan. Born in Gah, a village now in Pakistan's Punjab Chakwal district, Singh’s connection to the place was irrevocably marked by tragedy. When one of his daughters asked if he wished to visit, Singh replied softly, “No, not really. That is where my grandfather was killed.”Singh’s journey from a modest village boy to India’s 13th prime minister brought global attention to Gah, where locals fondly recall their connection to “Mohna,” as he was called.Daman Singh, the former PM's daughter, authored a book titled ""Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan"", which was released by HarperCollins in the year 2014. The publication aimed to present a detailed narrative about the ""story of her parents"".The village school, where Singh studied until Class 4, holds a symbolic place in their hearts. His admission number, 187, remains etched in its register, dated April 17, 1937. The school was renovated during his tenure as prime minister, and there were discussions about renaming it in his honour. However, despite Gah’s pride in him, Singh never returned.In 2008, he invited his schoolmate, Raja Muhammad Ali, to Delhi, an event villagers cherish. Ali passed away in 2010, and the remaining ties between Singh and Gah grew weaker. With Singh’s passing at 92 in Delhi, the villagers mourned deeply, describing him as family. “The entire village is in mourning. We feel that someone from our family has died today” Altaf Hussain, a teacher at Singh’s former school, told news agency PTI.""All these villagers are deeply moved… They were eager to attend his last rites in India but it is not possible. So they are here to mourn,"" Raja Ashiq Ali, who was a fellow student, made a journey to Delhi in 2008 for a meeting with him.Pakistan’s former foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri also reflected on Singh’s legacy. He recalled Singh’s desire to visit Gah and his vision for regional harmony, famously envisioning a day when one could “have breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore, and dinner in Kabul.” Kasuri credited Singh for fostering trust and progress in Indo-Pak relations, particularly through initiatives to resolve the Kashmir dispute.Singh’s passing severs tangible bond between Gah and its most famous son. While the man who once sang of Partition’s pain in family picnics is gone, his legacy as a statesman and reformer endures, remembered fondly on both sides of the border.","Dr Manmohan Singh was born in Gah, a village now in Pakistan's Punjab Chakwal district.

For Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ensuring Dallewal's health is priority. Defusing the situation is secondary: ""It is state govt which must act to comply with the unambiguous order of the highest court.""The bench agreed with SG and told Punjab govt that it must first ensure the health of the fasting farmer and thereafter the court would do everything possible to hear Dallewal's point of view.",Supreme Court asks Punjab govt why contempt proceedings not initiated against them.

The city crime branch has ruled out the dispute over Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects in Bandra East as the motive. The police are likely to submit the chargesheet against 26 arrested accused in a week.Siddique was shot dead on Oct 12 near son Zeeshan Siddique's office in Bandra East. The Bishnoi gang had fired at Salman Khan's bungalow on April 14 for his alleged involvement in killing of a black buck in Rajasthan.A police officer said, ""Prima facie, we have not found any evidence to link the murder to SRA dispute as alleged by Siddiqui's son Zeeshan. Though we recorded statements from a few developers, nothing came out. We are relying on whatever one of the suspects, Shubam Lonkar alias Shubbu, uploaded in a post on social media claiming responsibility two days after the firing."" Lonkar, who is on the run, had claimed the Bishnoi gang was behind the killing. Anmol Bishnoi is holed up in Canada and police are in the process of trying to get him to India.The SRA angle was initially explored after a post on X from Siddiqui's son Zeeshan. Zeeshan had raised the SRA issue with govt officials and in his post, he claimed that his father died protecting the lives and homes of the poor.Sources said that the chargesheet is almost ready and will be filed in the first week of Jan 2025 before Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) court against 26 arrested accused. Canada-based gangsters Anmol Bishnoi, Shubam Lonkar and Zeeshan Akhtar have been shown as absconding accused. Though they want to interrogate jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, police have not come across any direct evidence linking him.""The shooters were told that Siddiqui was Dawood's man and was responsible for the death of Anuj Thapan, one of the suspects in the Salman Khan firing case.

Manmohan Singh could be brutally candid if he trusted you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-could-be-brutally-candid-if-he-trusted-you/articleshow/116727855.cms,"To paraphrase one of the greatest scientists (Einstein) speaking about the greatest Indian ( Mahatma Gandhi ), one could justifiably say that later generations would scarcely believe that a person with the character and style of MMS had been so successful in the hurly burly of Indian administration and politics, and would ride its uppermost crests for decades.Since much is already written and spoken about him, let me cover some uncovered incidents and anecdotes. Highly taciturn at the best of times and never gregarious, MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam , where he was an accused simply because he was, as Prime Minister, also the coal minister for the relevant time.After I assured him that there was no case worth the name against him, there was pin-drop silence till, in a plaintive voice, he said: 'I have tried all my life never to go near illegality. How could my name even appear there? When will my name be cleared because I know I have done nothing remotely wrong."" I had no real answer except to mumble about the vagaries of our legal system which lead agencies and the judicial system to include a name in the accused list even when they know that it is completely vicarious. I know that MMS, being the most honorable man I have encountered in public life , would not be satisfied with the abatement and closure which death brings to a criminal prosecution but would insist on an exoneration.Secondly, he could be brutally and embarrassingly candid in the company of trusted persons. In front of a then sitting cabinet minister and a senior lady civil servant from Punjab in the PMO, he told me directly about one of his deepest regrets qua me, while hinting at forces beyond his control. Decency and confidentiality inhibit me from disclosing the subject of that remark. He repeated that to me at least four times subsequently.Thirdly, he made it a point to remember his friends and well wishers irrespective of the exalted posts he held. Despite bickering and back-biting in some quarters regarding Narasimha Rao , MMS regularly visited him in his last years and went for almost all of Rao's birth and/or death anniversaries till his health permitted. He made considerable efforts to change his programs to condole my father's death in 2007 and to attend the wedding of my two sons, one in 2013 and the other in 2015. Gursharan ji's great interest in and profound knowledge of music meant that while she attended many of my wife's ghazal and Sufi concerts, 'Dr Saheb' also came impromptu for a couple, once as a sitting PM and another after demitting office. He was simplicity personified and had absolutely no airs and pretenses.Fourthly, I have yet to see an Indian politician who kept his family so scrupulously insulated from his public life and, reciprocally, how much his wife and three daughters (one abroad) have shunned public glare, glamour and media attention. I was actually in the same batch of St Stephen's College as his daughter Upinder. She did History (Hons) and I Economics. We knew each other though not well. Not once did anyone from the MMS family try and leverage his exalted status and not once did it even enter my mind to exploit my acquaintance with Upinder. The entire ecosystem in which MMS thought, worked, lived and operated was far, far away from such approaches.As a Trinity, Cambridge alumnus, I would ask him about his drive which made him one of the few non-academics I knew in India with degrees from both of Oxbridge. He would wryly say that having studied under kerosene lamps and streetlights, he understood early on that education was the greatest equalizer.I hope India has the good fortune of getting such an illustrious son again in the near future though I believe that it is going to be very, very difficult.(The writer is an eminent lawyer & Rajya Sabha MP)","MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam.

"Manmohan Singh combined courage, vision & humility",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-combined-courage-vision-humility/articleshow/116727815.cms,"On The 1991 Devaluation:

My contact with Manmohan Singh goes back to the end of the 1960s when both of us were in New York. He was in the United Nations and I was teaching at New York University. Later on, we started working together in the mid-1980s when he was governor of the Reserve Bank of India and I was a deputy governor.If you look at his entire career, three important qualities stand out. One is vision, the other is courage and the third is humility. Ideas are needed to move the system forward, but you must have vision. Adequate vision must be supplemented by courage, which we saw in the early 1990s.The most important aspect of Dr Singh's actions is the exhibition of both ideas and implementation. The reforms introduced in the early 1990s, and the subsequent actions that he took in the period when he was PM, all indicate this combination of ideas and implementation.We worked together and there was an exchange of ideas. Even when we differed, we did so politely. He tried to take everybody along with him, and he gave the freedom to discuss freely. Finally, a conclusion was reached in which everybody agreed.There were occasions when we differed. But that did not come in the way of executing the ideas. There was also the quality of humility in him, which was extraordinary. For a person who held such important positions, he never rode roughshod over anybody.For example, in bringing to an end the system of issuing ad-hoc treasury bills, when I mentioned to him how this system acted a way that it resulted in the automatic monetisation of the fiscal deficit, he heard me out and then agreed, even though I did not expect he would agree to it that quickly. But he did, because when he saw the logic, he tried to follow it and implement whatever suggestion was made.Bringing the issue of these bills to an end could result in the cost of govt borrowing going up. But he was willing to bear it because the underlying principle was correct.Again, when we moved from the system of dual exchange rate to a system in which the market fully determined the exchange rate, there were many arguments against the move. There were suggestions that we move slowly. But when I discussed it with him, we decided that it was better to move in one step. He once again saw the benefit that comes from a particular action and immediately agreed to implement it.What he cared for is the benefit to the nation, benefit to society. If that demanded a particular action, he would take that action immediately.Originally, a decision was taken to devalue the rupee in two stages. I was in charge of announcing the exchange rate and made the first move.Before the second move could be made, there were some concerns whether we should devalue the rupee to such an extent. We had discussed the problem thoroughly and a conclusion had been reached and was also communicated to the President. But then the Prime Minister (PV Narasimha Rao) had some concerns on going ahead with the second step. Dr Singh said he would get in touch with me but then he went on saying that he was not able to reach me. By the time he reached me, I'd already ""jumped the step"".If he had backed down at that time, it would have reflected badly on India. Our ability to borrow in the market would have been hindered as it would have been seen as our unwillingness to take appropriate action.When the decision to devalue the rupee was taken, Dr Singh wrote a cheque and asked for it to be credited to the PM's Relief Fund. The amount represented difference in rupee value of his assets abroad following the devaluation. That showed how he was not willing to benefit by any decision personally. That shows the man's character, that his integrity was beyond question.He certainly managed the system both as the FM and the PM very well. History will remember him as one of the ablest PMs. Between 2005-06 and 2007-08, India had a growth rate in excess of 9%, which is outstanding.He will be remembered for ushering in efficiency in the system. That is what compelled him to move towards a competitive system. That is an important lesson for a country like India because if we really want to be able to compete in the world, let us say through exports, then efficiency becomes critically important. Without an efficient economic system, we cannot do it.As told to Surojit Gupta","The most important aspect of Dr Singh's actions is the exhibition of both ideas and implementation.

How a 'meek' PM Manmohan Singh flexed muscles to seal Nuclear deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-a-meek-pm-manmohan-singh-flexed-muscles-to-seal-nuclear-deal/articleshow/116727106.cms,"Former PM Manmohan Singh

NEW DELHI: Seen as ""docile"" and ""time server"", Manmohan Singh was supposed to fold up when threatened with the survival of his fortuitous perch of Prime Minister. Then indispensable UPA pillar, the CPM, led by a doctrinaire Prakash Karat, had laid down the red line over the path-breaking Indo-US nuclear deal .But instead of putting survival over self-respect, Singh defended the deal to the Communist apparatchik in a matter-of-fact chat on August 7, 2007, and defied him to carry out his threat. ""If you want to withdraw support, so be it.""The Left withdrew, a tumultuous numbers game with Communists, BJP ""communalists"" and Mayawati on the same side, was won and the 'Deal' was delivered. And so was a ""muscular Manmohan"", who months later led Congress to a big win in the 2009 LS polls to emerge as a leader in his own right.Behind Singh's transition from ""meek"" to ""muscular"" was the seminal event that included high policy calculations and sharp political manoeuvrings. In the thick of it was Samajwadi Party, ever eager to join govt and make up for the slight of 1999 when Mulayam Singh Yadav refused to support Sonia Gandhi's bid to form govt after the fall of Vajpayee govt by one vote. It was also an opportunity for Mulayam to find place on the treasury benches he had failed to secure when Congress and its allies managed enough seats to form govt without his support after the 2004 LS polls.Singh tied up with Mulayam, known as a China phobe, with Congress managers promising Samajwadis relief from their legal troubles. To make the deal about policy, a briefing on '123 agreement' by NSA M K Narayanan was organised at then Mulayam confidant late Amar Singh's Lodhi Estate residence.The SP crossover changed the numbers' game, while the opposition bid to trigger defections from govt camp was countered by an equally aggressive counter-attack.For 12 days, the capital became a hub of meetings and late night huddles, surreptitious contacts and secret offers. Karat had, informally, termed Mayawati's switch to the ""nay"" group as a ""game changer"". BJP managers threw their all into the attempt to bring down the UPA. And as seen in the Parliament complex on the day of the dramatic vote, the cut-throat exercise had made BJP roll in some of its ailing MPs in ambulances for voting against the Deal.The clash eventually saw three BJP MPs bring wads of cash in Lok Sabha to claim bribes offered - cash for vote - as it came to be known. But by July 22 evening, "" Singh is King "" was the buzzword swamping the cacophony of allegations and counter allegations, days after Left pulled out of govt on July 9, 2008.That was the moment that made Singh more than he was till then known for or capable of. Already a darling of the middle classes for his role in liberalising the economy, he became its mascot as the ""strong leader"" standing up for the country's progress and development, to the extent of even risking power.","Singh's transition from ""meek"" to ""muscular"" was the seminal event that included high policy calculations and sharp political manoeuvrings.

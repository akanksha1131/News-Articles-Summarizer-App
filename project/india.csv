Fuel switches found in ‘RUN’ position: Aftermath of AI 171 crash in images; what the wreckage shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fuel-switches-found-in-run-position-aftermath-of-ai-171-crash-in-images-what-the-wreckage-shows/articleshow/122398583.cms,"Images from the crash site offer further insight:

This image shows the initial impact zone as the aircraft descended rapidly after takeoff. The Dreamliner first made contact with a cluster of trees and an incineration chimney located inside the Army Medical Corps compound, indicating its dangerously low altitude.

Aircraft attitude at the time of impact with Building A



From the point of first contact with the trees to where the aircraft hit Building A’s northeast wall, the distance measured was 293 feet. This highlights the short time frame and minimal altitude the aircraft had before impact. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

Inboard parts of the right wing were found in Buildings A & B and the areas surrounding the buildings.



Captured here is the detachment of the right engine. After skimming across the roof of Building A, the right engine struck a concrete water tank structure, got separated from the main body of the aircraft, and eventually came to rest beneath the tank, facing approximately 226 degrees near the southwest wall of the building. Debris from the inboard sections of the right wing was also found scattered across Buildings A and B and the adjacent surroundings, indicating the force and fragmentation at impact.

Flap handle locked in normal takeoff position; landing gear found in 'DOWN' setting

The landing gear lever was found in the “DOWN” position (Figure 12), suggesting it had not yet been retracted by the time the emergency unfolded. These findings were also corroborated by data from the Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR). (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The flap handle assembly (fig.11) sustained significant thermal damage. The handle was found to be firmly seated in the 5-degree flap position, consistent with a normal takeoff flap setting.

Despite the damage, the handle was firmly set in the 5-degree position, which is consistent with a normal takeoff configuration. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

RAT deployment seconds after lift-off, with no evidence of bird activity in the vicinity.



This image is from airport CCTV footage, capturing the moment the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed during the initial climb—a few seconds after liftoff. The RAT deployment indicates a severe loss of engine power, as it is only activated when both engines drop below idle speed and the aircraft needs emergency hydraulic and electrical power. The CCTV footage confirmed that no significant bird activity was present in the vicinity, ruling out a bird strike. EAFR data also verified that both engines’ N2 values fell below idle, triggering the RAT’s hydraulic pump to start supplying power at 08:08:47 UTC.

Flight data preserved: Forward EAFR powered by backup system even after crash



The thrust lever quadrant sustained significant thermal damage. Both thrust levers were found near the aft (idle) position. However, the EAFR data revealed that the thrust levers remained forward (takeoff thrust) until the impact. Both fuel control switch were found in the “RUN” position. (fig.13) The reverser levers were bent but were in the “stowed” position. The wiring from the TO/GA switches and autothrottle disconnect switches were visible, but heavily damaged. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The APU air inlet door (fig. 10), which was intact, was found open. The fuselage fragmented and sustained thermal damage as it traveled along the northwest faces of Buildings C, D, E, and F with the furthest debris observed at about 765 feet southwest from the initial point of contact with building A. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The vertical stabilizer (fig. 5) separated from the aft fuselage and came to rest about 200 feet south of the initial point of contact with the Building A. The tail section and the RH Main Landing Gear (MLG) of the aircraft were found embedded in the northeast wall of the Building A while the rest of the airplane continued its forward movement.

NEW DELHI: The crash of Air India flight AI 171 on June 12 has been traced back to a sudden and unexplained fuel cutoff to both engines just three seconds after takeoff from Ahmedabad, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has revealed in its preliminary report. The report, released Saturday, includes a detailed timeline of the final moments of the London-bound Dreamliner, supported by critical images showing the impact trail, wreckage, and damage to key aircraft components.Images included in the report capture the dramatic descent of the Boeing 787 as it clipped treetops, an incineration chimney, and then collided with the BJ Medical College hostel building just 1.6 km from the runway. The aircraft, weighing 213.4 tons—nearly its maximum takeoff weight—never gained sufficient altitude after lift-off.“The aircraft achieved maximum recorded airspeed of 180 knots… and immediately thereafter, the engine 1 and engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of one second,” the report states. This caused both engine fan rotation speeds (N1 and N2) to fall below minimum idle, deploying the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), as captured in airport CCTV footage.The pilots declared a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” distress call 26 seconds after lift-off. Cockpit recordings revealed one pilot asking the other why the engines were shut off, with the second responding, “he did not do so.”Despite attempts to restore fuel supply (engine 1 and 2 fuel switches flipped back to RUN within 14 seconds), it was too late. The aircraft crashed at 1:39:11 pm (IST), just 32 seconds after becoming airborne.While the precise cause behind the fuel cutoff remains under investigation, the report notes a 2018 FAA bulletin warning of possible disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature on similar aircraft. Air India, however, had not performed inspections as the advisory was non-mandatory.Air India responded to the report, stating: “We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time. We acknowledge receipt of the preliminary report… and continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities.”The final investigation is ongoing and may determine whether mechanical failure, human error, or design vulnerabilities led to the switches’ sudden transition from “RUN” to “CUTOFF.”","The right engine detached after hitting a concrete water tank on the roof, resting near the building’s southwest wall.

KOHIMA: Nine cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have so far been reported in Nagaland this year, prompting the state's health department to issue a public advisory calling for increased vigilance, especially during the ongoing monsoon season when the risk of mosquito-borne diseases is at its peak.The state's department of health and family welfare said that JE is a potentially severe viral infection transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water sources like paddy fields and ponds. The disease can cause brain inflammation and lead to serious complications or death.""For every symptomatic JE case, there are likely 300 to 1000 asymptomatic infections,"" the department noted, underlining the importance of early detection and preventive action.Pigs, which act as amplifying hosts, play a key role in the transmission cycle. The virus, however, is not spread from person to person, the department said.""There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE; medical care is focused on managing symptoms. The typical incubation period is 5-10 days,"" it said.""The district health units have been directed to strengthen disease surveillance, carry out fogging operations, and raise public awareness. The health department has advised individuals experiencing sudden high fever, headache, vomiting, or confusion to seek immediate medical attention,"" the advisory said.The department also highlighted the need to boost routine immunisation, promote community engagement, and respond swiftly to any new cases.",Nine cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Nagaland this year.

Ahmedabad Air Crash: Black Box Of AI 171 Recovered From Crash Site After 28 Hours

Here are the key findings from the preliminary investigation report:

Fuel to both engines cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC, the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were triggered, one second apart. ""The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,"" the report states.

Cockpit voice recorder captures pilot confusion: The cockpit voice recording reveals confusion in the final moments. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so."" Investigators are looking into whether the switches were triggered manually, inadvertently, or by a system malfunction.

Relight attempt on engines: The flight data shows that an automatic relight was attempted. Engine 1 briefly responded, but Engine 2 did not recover despite multiple attempts to reintroduce fuel. This failure ultimately made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain thrust.

Emergency RAT deployment: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source deployed in response to power failure, activated right after takeoff, a clear indicator of loss of electrical power to critical systems.

Mayday call issued moments before: At 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots issued a distress call: ""MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY."" The Air Traffic Controller attempted to confirm the call sign but received no further response. Seconds later, the aircraft crashed.

Aircraft crashed in nose-up attitude: Flight path analysis shows the aircraft hit buildings near BJ Medical College with an 8-degree nose-up pitch and level wings. With no thrust from either engine, the aircraft could not sustain flight.

Thrust levers found in idle post-crash: Although the thrust levers were in takeoff position during flight, they were found in idle after the crash. Flaps and landing gear were confirmed to be in standard takeoff positions, ruling out abnormal configuration as a factor.

Wreckage spread across 1,000 feet: The plane disintegrated across a wide zone, hitting multiple buildings. Debris, including engines and landing gear, was scattered over more than 1,000 feet, indicating the force of the impact and trajectory.

Aircraft airworthy, no fuel control issues logged earlier: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certification. Though there were some minor Category C and D MEL (Minimum Equipment List) issues, none related to fuel control. Notably, no previous issues with fuel cutoff switches had been reported.

Optional Boeing advisory not followed: While Boeing had issued an optional advisory on fuel control switch locking mechanisms, Air India had not carried out the recommended checks. The aircraft’s throttle control modules had been replaced in 2019 and 2023.

Next steps in investigation



NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIM) Saturday released its preliminary report into the tragic crash of Air India 171 in Ahmedabad on June 12, which claimed 260 lives.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after tragic crash, details the early findings and current status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London Gatwick.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit.

Subbu targeted locked flats, stealing gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 60.4 lakh.

Ring the bell and then search for key





BENGALURU: In an apartment complex bustling with software professionals and startup entrepreneurs, no one expected a thief to be living right next door.Residents of GM Infinity in Electronics City Phase 2 were left stunned when police arrested a 26-year-old man for pulling off a string of high-value thefts right under their noses.The accused is Nitesh Subbu, an unemployed graduate from West Bengal, who had been staying with his sister in the same apartment at Thirupalya. Police recovered around 641 grams of gold and 56 grams of silver ornaments, altogether worth Rs 60.4 lakh.Subbu, who previously worked as an assistant in a real estate firm, targeted three locked flats in the apartment.On the night of July 3, he broke into the house of professor Suresh Iyer, 62, who works at Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Suresh's nephew filed a complaint with Hebbagodi police on June 5. Since her uncle had been working in Dehradun for the last four months, the house was locked, and his wife used to come to Bengaluru once in a few days.

Air India acknowledges report

NEW DELHI: The initial probe into the crash of AI 171 has revealed that three seconds after getting airborne from Ahmedabad on June 12, fuel supply to both engines of the Air India Boeing 787 operating as AI 171 got cut off. The engines’ fan speed began dropping and the aircraft weighing 213.4 tons — which was close to its maximum take off weight with 54,200 kg of jet fuel — started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall. The reason: fuel cutoff switches of the London-bound Dreamliner’s engine 1 and 2 transitioned from “run” to “cutoff” position one after another with a time gap of a second.How and why this happened is not yet known. But what it led to is: The pilots issued a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” call 26 seconds after getting airborne and after that the crash happened within six seconds.The two pilots were taken aback by the unexpected fuel cutoff. “One of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says the report prepared by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and made public early Saturday.As a result the engines’ fan rotation speed (N1 and N2) started decreasing even as the ill-fated aircraft weighed 2,13,401 kg on take off — close to its maximum take off weight of 2,18,183 kg. “The aircraft achieved maximum recorded airspeed of 180 knots indicated air speed at about 08:08:42 UTC (Greenwich time) and immediately thereafter, the engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of one sec. The engine N1 and N2 (fan rotation speed of different stages) began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off,” says the report.The aircraft’s “Ram Air Turbine” (RAT) got deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off as “both engines’ N2 (fan rotation speed) values passed below minimum idle speed,” it says. No significant bird activity was observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.Ten seconds later (08:08:52 UTC) the engines’ fuel cutoff switches for one engine transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN, resuming fuel supply. Four seconds later the same happened for the other engine. Engine 1 “started to progress to recover” with the other re-introducing fuel to achieve the same. However, by then it was too late. Nine seconds later (08:09:05), pilots transmitted “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY”.“The air traffic controller (responded).. did not get any response… observed the aircraft crashing outside the airport boundary, activated the emergency response. At 08:14:44 UTC, crash fire tender left the airport premises for rescue and firefighting.”“After takeoff, the aircraft impacted the BJ Medical College hostel which is 0.9 nautical miles (1.6 km) from the departure end of runway… As the aircraft was losing altitude, it initially made contact with a series of trees and an incineration chimney inside the Army Medical Corps compound before” crashing on the hostel.The AAIB report says “scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB (the ill-fated Dreamliner) in 2019 and 2023. However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB.”Why did the fuel cutoff switch transition from “run” to “cutoff” for both the engines on June 12 on the Dreamliner may be known once the ongoing probe is complete.Without linking it to the cause, the report says US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had in Dec 2018 issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) “regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. This SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive (AD) by the FAA. The fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models including part number 4TL837-3D which is fitted in B787-8 aircraft VT-ANB. As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023.”Soon after the release of the report, Air India issued a statement acknowledging the report. ""Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident. We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time. We acknowledge receipt of the preliminary report released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) today, 12 July 2025. ""Further assuring their cooperation with the investigation, it added, ""Air India is working closely with stakeholders, including regulators. We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB.""",Fuel supply to both engines of the Air India Boeing 787 operating as AI 171 got cut off.

Air India 171 crash probe: Cockpit audio reveals pilots' confusion over mid-air fuel cutoff - 10 key points from AAIB preliminary report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-171-crash-probe-cockpit-audio-reveals-pilots-confusion-over-mid-air-fuel-cutoff-10-key-points-from-aaib-preliminary-report/articleshow/122395222.cms,"Here are 10 key findings from the preliminary probe report:

Fuel supply to both engines was cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after takeoff, both engines’ fuel control switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF within one second of each other, leading to sudden loss of thrust. Pilot confusion in cockpit: One pilot is heard asking “Why did you cutoff?” to which the other replied, “I did not do so,” suggesting a potential technical malfunction or inadvertent activation. Relight attempt failed on one engine: The flight data shows relight was automatically attempted and succeeded for Engine 1, but Engine 2 failed to recover despite multiple fuel reintroductions. RAT deployed immediately: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source, deployed right after liftoff, indicating a total loss of power to essential systems. Mayday call issued seconds before crash: At 08:09:05 UTC, a distress call was made, just seconds before the aircraft impacted buildings outside the airport perimeter. Aircraft crashed nose-up but with engines off: Analysis shows the plane hit buildings with an 8° nose-up attitude and level wings, but with both engines inactive, unable to sustain climb. Cockpit controls in normal takeoff mode: Flap and landing gear levers were in standard takeoff positions; thrust levers were found in idle post-crash, though they were at takeoff thrust during flight — confirming an in-flight cutoff. Debris and wreckage strewn over 1,000 ft: The aircraft hit several buildings and structures, with components like engines, wings, and landing gears scattered across a wide crash zone near BJ Medical College hostel. Aircraft was airworthy with minor MEL issues: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certificates and a few Category C and D MELs (non-critical maintenance issues), none linked to fuel control. No prior issues reported with fuel control switches: While Boeing had issued an advisory (not mandatory) on fuel control switch lock concerns, Air India had not conducted the optional inspections. The aircraft had previous throttle module replacements in 2019 and 2023.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released its preliminary report into the Air India plane crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad on June 12.The 15-page report, published early Saturday, outlines the initial findings and status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner headed for London Gatwick. The aircraft went down shortly after take-off, crashing into a medical hostel complex near the airport. Of the 241 people onboard, only one passenger survived.This was the first fatal crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, marking a significant and tragic milestone for the wide-body aircraft.A status report on the crash was earlier released by the civil aviation ministry on June 26.Also read: AAIB releases preliminary report, says fuel supply to both engines was cut off The investigation is ongoing.

Pakistan-based terror outfits could use Nepal to launch attacks on India: Nepalese official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-based-terror-outfits-could-use-nepal-to-launch-attacks-on-india-nepalese-official/articleshow/122397764.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a blunt warning that has confirmed the worst fears of Indian security establishment, a senior Nepalese govt advisor has cautioned that Pakistan-based terrorist organisations were likely to exploit Nepal's geography to launch attacks on India.During a seminar on challenges to regional peace and security in South Asia in Kathmandu, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, principal political advisor to the president of Nepal and former minister of industry, said Pakistan-based UN-designated terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) posed risks to India and could potentially use Nepal as a transit point for their nefarious objectives.The vulnerability of Nepal to terrorism was highlighted through specific incidents, such as hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu.Pakistani terrorist groups have been known to utilise Nepal as a transit route to infiltrate into India. Notable cases include the arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda, a top LeT operative involved in over 40 bombings in India, who was held on the India-Nepal border in 2013. The case of Mirza Dilshad Beg, an assassinated Indian-Nepali parliamentarian who had links with Dawood Ibrahim's D-company and ISI, is another case in point.Yasin Bhatkal, co-founder of Indian Mujahideen, was apprehended by Nepal police in 2013 and handed over to Indian authorities. In April 2024, Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had arrested two Pakistani nationals - Mohammed Altaf Bhat and Sayyed Gajanfar - along with their aide Nasir Ali, near the Nepal border.A Nepalese citizen was among those who were targeted on the basis of their Hindu faith by jihadis in Pahalgam in April this year.The seminar, organised by Nepal Institute for International Cooperation & Engagement, brought together experts, policymakers and former officials to discuss the threat of terrorism in the region. Speakers emphasised that terrorism in the region has far-reaching consequences, including economic losses, and hindered regional integration and stressed the need for global unity and cooperation to combat terrorism, citing the importance of intelligence sharing and joint border patrolling between India and Nepal.Speakers at the seminar included Thapa; Minendra Rijal, former defence minister of Nepal; Chanda Chaudhary, member of Parliament; Shisir Khanal, former minister; Dinesh Bhattarai, former diplomat; N P Saud, former minister of foreign affairs; Purna Silwal, former major general of the Nepal army; and Madhu Raman Acharya, former foreign secretary of Nepal.","Sunil Bahadur Thapa said Pakistan-based UN-designated terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) posed risks to India.

Muslims are world's fastest growing religious group: Pew,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslims-are-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group-pew/articleshow/122396546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Muslims emerged as the fastest growing religious group in the world over 2010-2020, while the share of Christians - the world's largest religious group - in the global population fell by 1.8 percentage points to 28.8%, a Pew Research Centre analysis stated. Hindus grew at about the same rate as the world's overall population, reaching 1.2 billion in 2020, of whom 95% are in India.As of 2020, Hindus made up 79% of the population in India, compared to 80% in 2010. The share of Muslims rose from 14.3% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2020, revealed the analysis titled 'How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020'.Globally, people with no religious affiliation - sometimes called ""nones"" - were the only category aside from Muslims that grew as a percentage of the world's population, rising by 270 million and reaching 1.9 billion. The share of ""nones"" climbed by nearly a full percentage point to 24.2%.The research shows that the number of Muslims increased by 347 million - more than for all other religions combined. The share of the world's population that is Muslim rose by 1.8 percentage points to 25.6%.As a proportion of the global population, Hindus held steady at 14.9% in 2020. The figure was 15% in 2010. The number of Hindus worldwide grew 12% from 2010 to 2020, rising from a little less than 1.1 billion to nearly 1.2 billion.Buddhists were the only major religious group that had fewer people in 2020 than a decade earlier. In 2010, Christians accounted for 30.6% of the global population, followed by Muslims (23.9%), Hindus (15%), Buddhists (4.9%), unaffiliated (23.3%), other religions (2.2%) and Jews (less than 1%).The analysis draws attention to the various factors driving change in religious demographics. A key factor for Christians shrinking as a share of the global population is the widespread switching out of religion. This ""religious disaffiliation"" among Christians overrides their demographic advantage (high fertility).Muslim population growth is largely driven by their relatively young age profile and a high fertility rate. Hindus remain a stable share of the world's population because their fertility resembles the global average, and surveys indicate that Hindus rarely switch out of their religion.The analysis shows that Muslims had the highest proportion of children in 2010 (35% of the world's Muslims were under the age of 15), followed by Hindus (31%).The research observes that Muslims and Hindus are the least likely to gain or lose adherents from religious switching. About one in every 100 adults raised Muslim or Hindu has left their native religion, and a similar number from a different religious group have switched to Islam or Hinduism.","The share of Muslims rose from 14.3% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2020.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism. HC, granting bail, directed applicant not to post any material on social media which could create disharmony among people.","Allahabad high court observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan does not prima facie constitute an offence.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released its preliminary report, late Friday, on the investigation about the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad on June 12.According to the report, ""The Engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off. In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.""The AAIB added that ""both engines were retrieved from the wreckage site and quarantined at a hangar in the airport."" It further stated, ""Components of interest for further examinations have been identified and quarantined.""Flight data indicates that an automatic relight was attempted and successfully carried out for Engine 1. However, Engine 2 failed to recover despite multiple attempts to reintroduce fuel.The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source, was deployed immediately after liftoff, signalling a total loss of power to essential aircraft systems.Investigators also confirmed an in-flight cutoff after determining that the flap and landing gear levers were in standard takeoff positions while the thrust levers were found in idle post-crash, despite being set to takeoff thrust during the flight.Also read: Cockpit audio reveals pilots' confusion over mid-air fuel cutoff - 10 key points from AAIB preliminary report Additionally, as per the Aircraft Maintenance Program, the last major line maintenance checks—L1-1 and L1-2—were carried out at 38,504:12 hours and 7,255 cycles.

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Friday successfully conducted trials of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile (BVRAAM) ‘ASTRA’ with an indigenous RF seeker against high-speed unmanned aerial targets at different ranges.Conducted off the coast of Chandipur in Odisha, the test validated the Astra missile’s advanced precision and lethality. The missile scored a direct hit on a flying target, with all onboard subsystems performing flawlessly and meeting the mission’s technical objectives.""DRDO and @IAF_MCC conducted successful trials of Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile (BVRAAM) ‘ASTRA’ with indigenous RF seeker against high-speed unmanned aerial targets at different ranges, target aspects and launch platform conditions from Su-30 Mk-I platform off the coast of Odisha,"" DRDO posted on X.ASTRA is designed to take out aerial targets at distances exceeding 100 kilometres. Its cutting-edge guidance and navigation systems give it the ability to strike with high accuracy. The missile has already been inducted into service with the Indian Air Force (IAF), bolstering the nation's air defence framework.The success of this trial is seen as a key milestone toward the operational deployment of the LCA AF MK1A variant, which is a more advanced version of the indigenous fighter jet.It reflects the increasing maturity of India’s homegrown defence production ecosystem.Behind the achievement is the coordinated effort of multiple organisations: the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), DRDO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC), Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DG-AQA), Indian Air Force, and the test range team.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh lauded the teams involved in the successful mission, praising the synergy among the various stakeholders. Dr Samir V Kamat, chairman of DRDO and Secretary of the Department of Defence Research and Development, also commended the collaborative spirit of scientists, engineers, and technicians who contributed to the milestone test.This successful firing of Astra from the LCA platform not only demonstrates the missile's capabilities but also reinforces India’s growing technological edge in aerial warfare systems.","Conducted off the coast of Chandipur in Odisha, the test validated the Astra missile’s advanced precision and lethality.ASTRA is designed to take out aerial targets at distances exceeding 100 kilometres.

Tharoor's praise, fuel for BJP

NEW DELHI: The conspicuous tension between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress party has become more pronounced as the Kerala unit leaders launched a scathing attack on the Thiruvananthapuram MP after he pitched himself as the CM face for the state polls due next year.Ambitious Tharoor, who had earlier thrown his hat into the Congress presidential race, a move that reportedly left a sour taste for the Gandhis, once again stirred the pot on Wednesday by sharing a survey that found 28.3 per cent of respondents saw him as the most suitable leader for the state.The post by Thaoor triggered a reaction from the Kerala Congress unit, with senior party leader K Muraleedharan taking a swipe at Thaoor, saying ""he should first decide which party he belongs to"".""Even if someone else is leading in the survey, if the UDF comes to power in the 2026 Assembly polls, the chief minister will be from the UDF,"" Muraleedharan told reporters on Thursday, reacting to a query on Tharoor's post on 'X'.""Our aim is to win the elections. We are not interested in such unnecessary controversies,"" he said.Amid growing rumblings within the Congress, senior leader Muraleedharan sought to downplay talk of Shashi Tharoor emerging as the party’s chief ministerial face in Kerala.""There are several senior leaders in the Kerala unit of Congress who would be in consideration for the post of CM, irrespective of what any survey says,"" he said.Muraleedharan added that the party follows a defined internal process: ""The party has a framework of rules according to which a decision would be taken as to who would be the next CM.""Another Kerala leader, Ramesh Chennithala, said it was not correct for the Congress Working Committee (CWC) member to praise PM Modi.""One thing is very clear, a Member of Parliament and a member of the CWC cannot praise the Prime Minister. It is not correct. It is painful for all the Congress workers and leaders in Kerala and throughout the country... It is a very serious issue,"" Chennithala told news agency ANI.The rift between Tharoor and the Congress high command appears to have deepened, particularly after his reaction to the recent terror attack in Pahalgam. His remarks drew sharp internal criticism, with some in the party accusing him of putting the Congress on the defensive at a sensitive time.Kerala is set to go to polls in April next year, as the five-year term of the second LDF government, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) veteran Pinarayi Vijayan , comes to an end.","Kerala unit leaders launch scathing attack on the Thiruvananthapuram MP after he pitched himself as the CM face for the state polls due next year.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off slapping a canteen worker over “stale food,” Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Friday upped the ante by publicly threatening AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel.“I will beat Imtiaz Jaleel so badly that he will not be in a position to run a hotel,” Gaikwad told news agency PTI, reacting to Jaleel’s criticism of the assault.The original incident began when Gaikwad, a two-time MLA from Buldhana, ordered dinner on Tuesday night and claimed the dal and rice were stale and foul-smelling. Enraged, he stormed into the canteen, forced a worker to smell the food, and slapped and punched him. A video of the assault soon went viral, prompting condemnation from across the political spectrum and sparking a debate on legislators' conduct.Also read: Case registered against Shiv Sena MLA for slapping canteen worker; 2 days after viral video Jaleel, a former MP and the Maharashtra state president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, condemned Gaikwad’s actions. “Beating a poor person in such a way is not right,” he said.Responding to Gaikwad's threat, Jaleel said, “Gaikwad has a history of fighting. If he is threatening me, then let me know the time and place. He doesn’t need to make an effort, I will reach that place… I have nothing to do with Sanjay Gaikwad, but if you are doing wrong… then I will stand with the poor person.”Jaleel also remarked that Gaikwad should have written a letter to the Speaker instead of resorting to violence.“Had Gaikwad been a bit educated, he would have written a letter to the Speaker. If the Speaker takes him seriously, he would have acted,” he added.On Friday, police registered a non-cognisable offence against Gaikwad and one of his supporters under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to voluntarily causing hurt and common intention. As the offence is minor, police cannot arrest the accused without court permission.Despite backlash, Gaikwad remained unapologetic. “I punched him twice. If needed, I will do it again,” he said, justifying his actions by accusing the canteen of “playing with people’s lives.” Following the incident, the Maharashtra FDA suspended the canteen’s licence, citing food safety violations.","Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Friday threatened AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel.

Supreme Court Asks EC to Consider Aadhaar, Ration, Voter ID for Bihar Voter Roll Revision

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship.

NEW DELHI : Supreme Court Friday declined to extend medical bail to former Haryana Congress MLA Dharam Singh Chhoker in a money laundering case and expressed its anguish over a wrong statement made by a senior advocate during the previous hearing pertaining to his hospitalisation.Taking note of the misleading statements of the lawyer which were not substantiated by documents, a bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and R Mahadevan remarked that the politician did not deserve any relief and dismissed his plea. HC had granted him interim medical bail, and he was to surrender on July 12, but he sought an extension before SC.“We have to say one thing, yesterday a misstatement was made by the senior counsel. Sorry to point it out. What he said was that he was admitted on June 30 in the hospital. His surgery was planned, and on July 2 his surgery was conducted, and he is still in hospital. Now document placed on record is that he is out of the hospital, discharged on July 5. That is good enough to dismiss this,” the bench remarked. SC also noted that senior counsel has changed and some other was appearing for him for obvious reason.As per the court’s previous order senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for the neta Thursday when the case was adjourned for a day Though the counsel appearing for him requested the court to “condone that defelcation”, the bench turned it down and said, “No, no, we can’t condone this.

Shirsat, however, rubbished the claim, saying the bag only contained clothes.The allegation came a day after it emerged that Shirsat had received a notice from the income tax department seeking an explanation for increase in his financial worth between the 2019 and 2024 assembly elections from Rs 3.3 crore to Rs 35 crore. Last month, Shirsat and his son withdrew from a hotel deal after an opposition outcry.Raut said in his post that Union home minister Amit Shah should take note. “I feel pity for CM Devendra Fadnavis! How many more times will he just sit and watch his reputation being torn to shreds? Helplessness has another name: Fadnavis!” Shirsat said in response, “The house seen in the video is my home. It shows I am sitting (clad in a vest) in my bedroom. My pet dog and a bag are also seen. This means I have just returned from travel and removed my clothes. If I have to keep such a big bag of money, is there a dearth of cupboards?” Criticizing the opposition for raking up the issue “deliberately,” Shirsat said, “They see (currency) notes even in cloth bags.” He added, “Had there been money, I would have kept it in the cupboard.”Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray said sarcastically that Mahayuti legislators were showing disregard for the rule framed by Modi govt that a person should not handle cash beyond Rs 2 lakh on a given day. Raut and Thackeray expressed their apprehensions about whether action would be taken against Shirsat and Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad (who assaulted MLA hostel canteen staffers) when their videos, they said, were “good enough to prove their crime.”Shirsat said, “Such claims won’t affect my (political) career.” Shirsat had told the media on Thursday he had sought more time to reply to the I-T department’s notice asking for an explanation for the increase in his financial worth. However, he had to backtrack on his remark that Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde had received a similar notice and later clarified that he had no knowledge of Shrikant Shinde receiving any I-T notice.Shirsat, an MLA from Sambhajinagar West, had declared Rs 44.8 crore in cash and liabilities of Rs 26.5 crore in loans from multiple banks in his election affidavit in Oct 2024.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Soham Parekh took Silicon Valley by storm—not with code, but with cunning.

In emails to founders, he praised their vision and introduced himself with:To stressed-out startup teams, he was the dream: all discipline, no distractions, a prodigy. What they got was a portfolio of deceit.

Renowned historian Neelakanta Sastri was once invigilating an exam. As was his habit, he paced the hall, reading a book, his long coat swaying. After the exam, something strange happened: the answer sheets of two students—one from the first row and another from the last—were identical.Puzzled, the evaluators summoned them. The boys denied wrongdoing, but the professors promised no punishment if they told the truth.And out it came.The student in the first row would write the answers, slip the sheet into the professor’s deep coat pocket and the one in the last row would retrieve it, copy it, and place it back.

That’s their weak point.” Conmen aren’t always brilliant—but they’re observant. They look you in the eye, smile warmly, exude trust—and then vanish with your wallet and your faith in humanity.Even Thiruvalluvar couldn’t resist a wry smile at this timeless phenomenon:He must have written this couplet with the tongue firmly in the cheek. No, he doesn’t appreciate those who cheat the vulnerable. He has dedicated an entire chapter on turpitude and warns us to be careful with fraudsters.

'None of videos of stir show any obstruction was done by accused'

NEW DELHI: A protest for voicing a dissenting opinion ""is not only the hallmark of democracy but also a fundamental right"" guaranteed under the Constitution, a Delhi court on Thursday said.The observation was made by additional chief judicial magistrate Neha Mittal while discharging 10 TMC functionaries, including MPs Derek O'Brien, Sagarika Ghose and Saket Gokhale, in a case registered against them for their protest in April last year outside the ECI, despite prohibitory orders being in place under section 144 of CrPC.The ACJM said the question was whether the accused persons violated the prohibitory orders, which was a reasonable restriction on the said fundamental rights. There was nothing on record to show that the accused persons knew of the order issued by the ACP concerned, the court said.The Delhi court order was pronounced on Thursday, but a copy was made available on Friday. The other TMC members named in the matter were Mohammed Nadimul Haque, Dola Sen, Vivek Gupta, Arpita Ghosh, Santanu Sen, Abir Ranjan Biswas and Sudip Raha.The court said the prosecution could not establish that the gathering of the accused persons was an unlawful assembly , nor could it prove they were commanded to disperse because of prohibitory orders being promulgated. The police complaint, based on which the FIR was registered, did not state that any obstruction, annoyance, injury or danger to human life, health or safety was likely to take place because of the acts of the accused.""None of the videos of the protest show that any obstruction was indeed caused because of the acts of the accused persons,"" the court said, adding there was no disruption to traffic, nor the entry to the ECI building was blocked.","A protest for voicing a dissenting opinion is a fundamental right, a Delhi court says.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand met on the margins of the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Canada, amidst efforts by both sides to rebuild the relationship after the diplomatic row over the killing of a Sikh separatist in 2023. While both sides appreciated progress in implementation of the new roadmap that was launched during Anand’s visit to India last month, the Canadian minister also stressed the significance of ongoing law enforcement dialogue between the two countries.While India sees the dialogue as important to check the anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in Canada, Ottawa considers essential for the safety and security of its own citizens. In an interview to ToI last month, Anand had said Canadians have the right to feel safe and secure in their own country.“Appreciated the progress in implementation of the New Roadmap 2025. Look forward to the further rebuilding of our bilateral partnership,” said Jaishankar after the meeting. India was among the guest countries that were invited to participate in the G7 meeting in the Niagara-on-the-Lake town.After the 2 sides announced a series of measures last month in a joint statement to normalise the relationship, including through trade discussions, Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu arrived in India on Wednesday to explore opportunities in trade and investment.However, Ottawa also maintains, and as Anand reiterated at a press event, rule of law and public safety concerns are foremost in the advancement of the relationship. Anand recalled the joint statement that sought a constructive relationship based on mutual respect for rule of law and a commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integritySignificantly, Anand, who has maintained that Canada will carry forward the relationship with a step-by-step approach, also asserted that the normalisation will be contingent on the law enforcement dialogue. “We are taking the relationship step by step to ensure that we are stressing the importance of public safety and security in the interests of all Canadian citizens, first and foremost...it will be systematic, and it will not occur unless we can ensure that this public safety dialogue continues,” said Anand in an interview to Canada’s CBC Radio. She was responding to a query on whether Canada can have a relationship with a country accused of violating its sovereignty.","Canada FM Anita Anand Visits India To Strengthen Bilateral Trade, Energy And Security Cooperation.

Red Fort blast 'heinous terror incident': Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-blast-heinous-terror-incident-centre/articleshow/125288755.cms,"How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet on Wednesday described Monday's car blast near Red Fort an act of ""terror"" in a description that signalled acknowledgement of the terrorists' plan to cause large-scale mayhem by striking multiple targets.""The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion near Red Fort on the evening of Nov 10, 2025. The explosion resulted in multiple fatalities, and caused injuries to several others,"" said the resolution adopted by the Union cabinet, which met soon after PM Narendra Modi's return from Thimphu and his visit to LNJP hospital to meet the victims of the blast carried out by a module comprising radicalised doctors and clerics.Though the case regarding the blast has been registered under the main anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency , which is tasked with investigating terror incidents, the govt had until now not formally declared the blast a terror attack as such. The designation of ""terror incident"" is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the Modi govt in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.As per the new policy, a terror attack, as the PM had spelt out in his address to the nation, is proposed to be treated and dealt with as an act of aggression against the country.Sources refrained from saying whether the blast on Monday fulfils the criterion and said a determination would be based on what the investigation across states might throw up. The cabinet, however, signalled its intent to use all options available to it against terror strikes. ""The cabinet reaffirms the govt's steadfast resolve to safeguard the lives and well-being of all Indians, consistent with its enduring commitment to national security and the safety of every citizen,"" it said.""The cabinet unequivocally condemns this dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives,"" it further said.The formal designation comes in the wake of mounting evidence that the ""Faridabad module"", increasingly being referred to as the ""white coat"" cell of terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) because of the shocking alleged involvement of doctors, had multiple targets in different parts on their radar. The huge stockpile of explosives - enough to blow up a large shopping mall - and a cache of assault rifles recovered from the alleged terrorists are seen as underlining the intent to carry out ""spectacular strikes"" in solidarity with JeM which lost its senior leaders during Operation Sindoor. The blast was preceded by arrests of a doctor and a few others in Gujarat who were plotting to carry out a bio-terror attack by using ricin, one of the most dangerous substances known.Officials also believe that the explosive device in the car was meant for some other target and that it got accidentally triggered near the Red Fort.The cabinet, which observed two-minute silence, also praised ""the timely and coordinated response of the authorities, security agencies and citizens who acted with courage and compassion in the face of adversity. Their dedication and sense of duty are deeply commendable"".""The cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay. The situation continues to be closely monitored at the highest levels of govt,"" said the resolution.","The Union cabinet on Wednesday described Monday's car blast near Red Fort as an act of ""terror"" The designation is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the Modi govt in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Two exit polls released Wednesday put NDA in the lead in Bihar, but while one projected a decisive verdict for BJP-led alliance with nearly two-thirds of the assembly's 243 seats, the other suggested it had a slender two percentage point lead in a close race and could be just a little over the halfway mark.The India Today-Axis My India poll projected that with 43% of the votes, NDA would get anywhere between 121 and 141 seats while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan would end up with 41% of the votes and 98-118 seats. The midpoints of the ranges, at 131 and 108, are quite close to the verdict five years ago when NDA won 125 seats and MGB 110.Today's Chanakya projected 148-172 seats for the NDA and 65-89 seats for the MGB. The two-thirds mark is 162 seats. This poll gave the NDA a 44% vote share, six percentage points higher than the 38% projected for MGB.Both exit polls suggested that the much-talked-about Jan Suraaj of Prashant Kishor would have little impact and win few if any seats.Interestingly, the India Today poll forecasts that RJD will remain the single largest party in the assembly, but BJP could drop to the third spot with JDU improving its tally and the saffron party doing significantly worse than in 2020.Earlier, a slew of exit polls on Tuesday had all given NDA a clear majority in the state assembly, differing only in the extent of the incumbent alliance's victory. The results are to be declared on Friday.",Two exit polls released Wednesday put NDA in the lead in Bihar.

Global carbon emission projected to hit record high in 2025; Renewable energy push makes emission growth in India & China slower,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-carbon-emission-projected-to-hit-record-high-in-2025-renewable-energy-push-makes-emission-growth-in-india-china-slower/articleshow/125287789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025, reaching record high of 38.1 billion tonnes, over 2024 with the US heading for the highest percentage increase of 1.9% followed by India (1.4%), China and the EU (0.4% each) among the big four emitting countries, shows Global Carbon Budget - an annual, peer-reviewed report released on Thursday.It says the emissions in India and China are, however, growing more slowly from 2024 to 2025 than in recent years due to strong growth in renewable energy in both the countries.Growth rate from 2023 to 2024 was the highest at 4% for India and 0.7% for China whereas the EU and the US reported a decline of 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively, when the overall global emissions increased by 0.8%. In 2024, the largest absolute contributions to global fossil CO2 emissions were from China (32%), the US (13%), India (8%), and the EU (6%).On the positive side, total CO2 emissions – the sum of fossil and land-use change emissions – have grown more slowly in the past decade (0.3% per year), compared to the previous decade (1.9% per year).The 20th edition of the annual report, produced by an international team of more than 130 scientists under the Global Carbon Project, however, underlined that though decarbonisation of energy systems is progressing in many countries, this is not enough to offset the growth in global energy demand.As a result, the remaining carbon budget for keeping the world within 1.5 degree Celsius of warming (around 170 billion tonnes of CO2 ) will be exhausted in about four years if emissions continue at current levels.The remaining carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be emitted while keeping global warming within a certain temperature limit, such as 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels. The budget is rapidly diminishing as emissions from fossil fuels and land-use change continue to far outpace the rate at which carbon is removed from the atmosphere.“The remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degree C, 170 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, will be gone before 2030 at current emission rate. We estimate that climate change is now reducing the combined land and ocean sinks - a clear signal from Planet Earth that we need to dramatically reduce emissions,” said Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, who led the study.According to the report, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is set to reach 425.7 ppm in 2025, 52% above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels.The report says, “With no sign of the urgently needed decline of global emissions, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere – and the dangerous impacts of global warming – continue to increase.”“It is 10 years since the Paris Agreement was negotiated, and despite progress on many fronts, fossil CO2 emissions continue their relentless rise. Climate change and variability are also having a discernible effect on our natural climate sinks. It is clear that the countries need to lift their game. We now have strong evidence that clean technologies help reduce emissions while being cost effective compared to fossil alternatives,” said Glen Peters, senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.","Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025. US heading for the highest percentage increase of 1.9% followed by India (1.4%), China and the EU (0.4% each) among the big four emitting countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125287801,imgsize-17482,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after the city's air quality slipped into the 'severe' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said the decision was taken after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) surged from 362 on Monday to 425 on Tuesday morning, due to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable weather conditions that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface.The Stage III curbs, which include a ban on non-essential construction and the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, build upon the measures already enforced under Stages I and II of the GRAP.Classes up to Class 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt.Several parts of the city registered alarming pollution levels with AQI readings crossing the 400-mark.As per CPCB data, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 412, Alipur reported 442, and Bawana registered the highest level at 462. Chandni Chowk recorded an AQI of 416, while RK Puram and Patparganj logged 446 and 438, respectively.Sonia Vihar also recorded a 'severe' AQI of 433, indicating hazardous air conditions across the city.During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages - Stage I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).Hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter are caused by unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local sources of pollution.",The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR.

Ladakh airbase close to China border activated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-airbase-close-to-china-border-activated/articleshow/125285799.cms,"Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.",India operationalises its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China. A large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar.

Network and recovery operations

Massive crackdown and heightened security



A thwarted network of radical professionals

NEW DELHI: The high-intensity explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed at least 12 people and injured several others has led to the unearthing of a trans-state “white-collar terror module” involving doctors, clerics, and radicalised professionals. According to officials, the accused were linked to banned terror outfits Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).Joint operations by the Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, Uttar Pradesh Police, and central agencies resulted in the arrest of at least seven suspects — including doctors from Al-Falah University in Faridabad and other parts of India — and the recovery of more than 2,900 kilograms of explosives and firearms across multiple states.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now taken over the probe.Dr Muzammil Ganaie, 35, from Koil in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, worked at Al-Falah University in Faridabad as a doctor and taught MBBS students. Police identified him as one of the key figures in the terror module.Following his arrest, officials recovered 358 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, a Krinkov assault rifle, three magazines, 91 live rounds, a pistol with cartridges, timers, batteries, remote controls, and other bomb-making material from his rented accommodation in Dhauj, Faridabad.Police told agencies that Muzammil conducted multiple reconnaissance visits of the Red Fort area in January, mapping crowd movements and security positions. “These visits were part of a detailed reconnaissance ahead of a planned attack on January 26,” a senior police officer told PTI.According to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team, around 40 samples collected from the Red Fort blast site indicated that one explosive sample was likely ammonium nitrate.Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, from Kulgam in Kashmir, was arrested from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He was also employed at Al-Falah University, working closely with Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi.Police sources told PTI that an AK-47 rifle was recovered from his locker at GMC Srinagar, where he had earlier worked as a senior resident. He is accused of being part of the Faridabad module that stockpiled explosives and weapons.Adeel’s arrest came after Muzammil’s interrogation, which revealed their collaboration in transporting and concealing explosives across multiple sites.Dr Umar Un Nabi, from Pulwama, was also associated with Al-Falah University and was reportedly driving the i20 car that exploded near the Red Fort, killing over 10 people.Sources told PTI that Dr Umar had been under surveillance but changed locations frequently. “He maintained close ties with Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel, coordinating logistics and storage of explosives,” an official said.Authorities confirmed that Umar was present in the vehicle during the blast. His alleged role as the executioner of the attack places him among the most critical suspects in the ongoing probe.Dr Shaheen Sayeed, a doctor from Lucknow, is alleged to be an active associate and close confidant of Dr Muzammil. She was brought by air to Srinagar for custodial interrogation after an assault rifle was recovered from her car in Faridabad.Police said she panicked following Muzammil’s arrest and discarded the weapon in a dustbin. Dr Shaheen reportedly maintained communication between members in Faridabad and contacts in Kashmir.Investigators believe she played a role in logistical coordination for the group’s operations and possibly helped procure chemical materials.Dr Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed, a Hyderabad-based doctor with an MBBS degree from China, was arrested by Gujarat ATS on November 8.He had been running a shawarma business in Rajendranagar, where he was allegedly radicalised through Telegram and social media. Authorities claim he was in contact with a handler named Abu Khadija linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP).Police seized two Glock pistols, a Beretta, live ammunition, and 4 kg of castor-bean mash (used to extract ricin poison). Officials said he conducted reconnaissance of security-sensitive sites in Delhi, Lucknow, and Ahmedabad, with weapons possibly delivered via drones from Pakistan.Two of his aides, Azad Suleman Sheikh (20) and Mohammad Suhail Khan (23), were also arrested.Irfan Ahmad, a cleric and Imam from Shopian, is accused of radicalising several members of the module, including young doctors. Police said he was responsible for motivating recruits and connecting them with militant networks in Kashmir.He was arrested during follow-up raids in Shopian after Dr Muzammil’s confession pointed to his involvement.Maulvi Ishtiaq, a native of Mewat, Haryana, served as Imam at Al-Falah Mosque in Faridabad’s Dhera Colony. Police recovered over 2,500 kilograms of explosives from his residence within the Al-Falah University complex.Officials said he had been staying on campus under the guise of a religious teacher and was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police before being brought to Srinagar for questioning.He is suspected of providing logistical support, including safe houses and connections to financial channels.Police on Tuesday took another Pulwama doctor, Sajad Malik, into custody for questioning, bringing the number of Kashmir-born doctors linked to the Delhi blast case to four.It remained unclear whether Malik's detention was aimed at gathering information about his friend Umar Un Nabi or if he was also being held as a suspect in the broader terrorism conspiracy.According to the police and intelligence agencies, the seven-member module used encrypted channels for communication, coordination, and movement of explosives.In Faridabad, questioning of over 52 individuals, including faculty and students of Al-Falah University, led to the recovery of the explosive materials and firearms.Subsequent raids in Shopian, Ganderbal, and Anantnag uncovered additional weapons, including an AK-56 rifle, pistols, and large quantities of IED components.Officials confirmed that Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi had plotted an attack during Republic Day celebrations, but the plan was delayed due to heightened security.After the Red Fort blast, the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces tightened security across the national capital. All entry and exit points were sealed, and vehicles were thoroughly checked.Senior officers supervised searches at interstate borders — including Ghazipur, Singhu, Tikri, and Badarpur — while sniffer dogs, anti-sabotage squads, and metal detectors were deployed at crowded locations.A senior police officer said, “We are taking no chances. The focus is on maintaining public confidence and ensuring that the city remains secure.”Officials described the module as a “white-collar terror network” that exploited academic institutions for recruitment and logistics.“The arrests have prevented a major conspiracy aimed at causing large-scale damage in the country,” an intelligence official said, adding that several Pakistani phone numbers were found on seized devices linked to the doctors.Investigations continue across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, with more arrests expected in the coming days.(With inputs from PTI, Naseer Ganai and Nikhil Sharma)","The high-intensity explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort has led to the unearthing of a trans-state ‘white-collar terror module’ involving doctors, clerics, and radicalised professionals.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

NEW DELHI: A newly surfaced CCTV footage captured the precise moment the Hyundai i20 exploded near the Red Fort on Monday, sending shockwaves through the congested lanes of Old Delhi.In the clip, shared by news agency ANI, the car is seen suddenly bursting into flames, disintegrating within seconds and sending shards and flames flying across the street. The impact was so devastating that the nearby vehicles were engulfed and severely damaged, while panic gripped the crowded street.The government on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the car blast near Delhi's Red Fort as a ""terrorist incident"".""The country has witnessed a heinous terrorist incident perpetrated by anti-national forces through a car explosion near Red Fort on 10th November,"" Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said during a Cabinet briefing, which began shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting to review the situation and assess the ongoing probe into the attack.At least twelve people were killed and several others injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a Hyundai i20 car near the Lal Quila Metro Station on Monday evening.According to preliminary post-mortem findings, the victims sustained severe injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma.The blast wave caused extensive internal damage, rupturing lungs, eardrums, and abdominal organs, while many victims showed deep wounds and heavy bleeding, suggesting they were thrown against hard surfaces by the force of the explosion.Forensic experts confirmed that no splinter traces were found on the bodies or clothing, and said the type of explosive used will be determined after laboratory analysis. Most injuries were concentrated on the upper body, head, and chest, officials said.Earlier in the day, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) collected DNA samples from the mother of Dr Umar Un Nabi, who was allegedly driving the i20 car that exploded near the Red Fort on November 10, killing eight and injuring several others, according to sources.Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has formed a dedicated team to probe the Delhi car blast, which investigators believe was executed by a Jaish-e-Mohammad module recently unearthed by Indian security agencies. The team, headed by senior officers of the Superintendent of Police rank and above, will conduct a coordinated and comprehensive investigation.","CCTV footage captured the precise moment the Hyundai i20 exploded near the Red Fort on Monday.

How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

Chidambaram’s earlier warning during Operation Sindoor debate

NEW DELHI: Former home minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday slammed the Centre over its “discreet silence” on what he described as the growing threat of homegrown terrorism.His statement comes two days after the Delhi bomb blast near Lal Quila Metro station that killed 12 people and injured several others.In a post on X addressing the recent Delhi blast and the arrests of educated professionals allegedly involved in the plot, Chidambaram reiterated his long-held concern over the rise of “homegrown terrorism” in India.Chidambaram wrote: “I have maintained before and after the Pahalgam terror attack that there are two kinds of terrorists — foreign-trained infiltrated terrorists and home-grown terrorists. I said so in Parliament during the debate on Operation Sindoor . I was mocked and trolled for the reference to home-grown terrorists. However, I must say that the government observed a discreet silence because the government knows that there are home-grown terrorists too. The point of this tweet is we should ask ourselves what are the circumstances that turn Indian citizens — even educated persons — into terrorists.”His remarks come amid revelations that several suspects have been arrested in the Delhi blast case. This includes doctors Muzammil Ganaie, Adeel Ahmad Rather, Shaheen Shahid and Umar Un Nabi who were allegedly part of a Faridabad-based terror module linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed .Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in Parliament during the Operation Sindoor debate. The counter-terror operation was launched after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.During the debate, Chidambaram had questioned the government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent operation.Raising concerns over the lack of transparency, he asked, “Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?”He further questioned the government’s reluctance to disclose details of the probe.“The Government is unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There’s no evidence of that,” Chidambaram said.His statement had sparked a sharp backlash from the BJP benches, with Home Minister Amit Shah accusing the Congress leader of “trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan.”Union home minister went on to detail the evidence gathered by investigating agencies.“NIA had already arrested those who gave them shelter. Those who fed them were detained. When the terrorists’ dead bodies reached Srinagar, they were identified as the three people who carried out the terror attack in Pahalgam. The rifles seized from them matched the FSL reports,” Shah said.Following the backlash, Chidambaram defended himself, accusing critics of distorting his remarks. He wrote on X, “Trolls are of different kinds and use different tools to spread misinformation.”","Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in Parliament during the Operation Sindoor debate.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed's elder brother, says family is in 'complete disbelief' Says family had not been in contact with her for past four years.

AHMEDABAD: A 41-year-old man has approached Gujarat high court seeking a divorce from his wife on grounds of cruelty, alleging she brought stray dogs into their home and arranged a prank call about an imagined extra-marital affair, causing him public humiliation.According to the man's appeal, the couple married in 2006 and his troubles began when his wife introduced a stray dog into their flat in a society that prohibited dogs as pets. She then brought in additional strays, made him cook, clean and care for them. He said one dog bit him when it insisted on sleeping in their bed.The husband said the presence of the dogs turned neighbours against them, leading to a police complaint in 2008. He alleged that after his wife joined an animal rights group, she repeatedly filed police complaints against others, summoned him to stations to assist her, and, on his refusal, abused and humiliated him.He claimed the stress destroyed his well-being and led to erectile dysfunction. He also alleged that on April 1, 2007, his wife arranged for a radio jockey to make a prank call about his supposed affair, which embarrassed him at work and in society.The man said he fled to Bengaluru but his wife continued to harass him.He filed a divorce suit in 2017 in an Ahmedabad family court, but she defended it by arguing that he had deserted her and introduced her to animal activism. She produced photographs of him embracing and kissing the dogs.In Feb 2024, the family court dismissed his petition, stating, ""Considering the evidence, the petitioner has failed to prove that the respondent treated him with cruelty or has deserted him."" Regarding the prank call, it held, ""This cannot be the grounds for seeking divorce...""The husband appealed, asserting the marriage was irretrievably broken and offering to pay Rs 15 lakh in alimony, while his wife insisted on Rs 2 crore.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

The scheme also aims to help exporters tap new markets and deal with branding and warehousing issues overseas.It also approved high royalty for four critical minerals - graphite, caesium, rubidium and zirconium - to get more interest from bidders in the proposed auction of blocks. Tenders have been issued for the auction of nine blocks of these critical minerals, five of which are for graphite.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a Rs 25,060 crore Export Promotion Mission (EPM), spread over six years, seeking to provide a cushion to several labour-intensive sectors hit by global tariffs, while also aiming to address the oft-repeated concerns over access to export credit and logistics as well as support market access and warehousing efforts.Besides, the Cabinet approved Rs 20,000 crore additional credit support for eligible exporters, including MSMEs, through credit guarantee scheme.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said rampant illegal mining in Aravali range, the natural barrier spread across Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi that's preventing desertification of Gangetic plains, is causing immense damage to the sensitive eco-system. The court reserved verdict on the issue of a uniform definition of what the Aravali range is.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that the report submitted by the expert committee set up by the SC in May last year on this issue appears to be oriented towards how to allow mining in the Aravalis rather than focusing on stringent measures to protect it.The entire Aravali Range must be protected as one geographical and morphological entity along with its eco-system and the protective measures cannot be allowed to be varied from state to state. He said along with conservation of Aravali range, restoration of its pristine form is equally important,"" Parameshwar said, adding that he must not be understood to advocate blanket ban on mining activities.The bench said a complete ban always leads to rampant illegal mining and we have seen how a hillock in Aravali was reduced to a column and how a road was illegally built in Nuh district for clandestine transportation of mined minerals from Haryana to Rajasthan.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, while complimenting the amicus for his zealous approach towards protection of the Aravali Range, said the SC-appointed committee has addressed every concern of the amicus while giving stringent guidelines for regulated mining under the principle of sustainable development. The bench agreed with her.The committee in its report said that all hillocks have a height of over 100m (from mean sea level) and these should be protected along with its slopes. ""Keeping in view the immense ecological and environmental significance of Aravalli hills and ranges, owing to their rich biodiversity and the wide range of ecosystem services they provide, such as groundwater recharge, regulation of desertification, and moderation of the regional microclimate, it becomes imperative to protect and conserve the area from further degradation,"" it said.""Core/inviolate areas - protected forests and tiger reserves and one km from their boundaries, eco-sensitive zones, afforestation areas and 500m from Ramsar sites and wetlands - may be designated in the Aravali hills and ranges for prohibiting mining in them,"" the committee said.However, the committee flagged that the Aravali range contains well-known repositories of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper, as well as precious and strategic minerals including gold and tungsten. ""In addition, the Aravali-Delhi system has been identified as having significant potential for critical minerals such as tin, graphite, molybdenum, niobium, nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements (REEs), all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security,"" it said.The committee opined that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravali Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is also necessary to evolve a framework that enables sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic and atomic minerals located within the region.""In view of the ecological significance of the Aravali hills and ranges, the committee recommends that the following environmental safeguards and regulatory measures be adopted by respective state governments to encourage systematic, sustainable, and environmentally friendly mining while effectively preventing illegal mining using modern and information technology tools,"" it said.","Rampant illegal mining in Aravali range causing immense damage to sensitive eco- system.

Doctor’s Car Leads To Chilling Terror Trail, Face Of Suspect Revealed

NEW DELHI: Nisar Ul Hassan, a doctor who was sacked by J&K LG Manoj Sinha in Nov 2023 from Srinagar's SHMS hospital over terror links, was hired by Al-Falah School of Medical Science and Research Centre, Faridabad, soon after and has emerged as a key suspect in the case relating to the JeM module behind Monday's Delhi car blast.TOI had on Wednesday exclusively reported that Hassan's role as the man behind radicalising and indoctrinating medical professionals including suspected car, bomber Umar Nabi, who worked with him in the general medicine department of Al-Falah, was under the scanner.Investigators suspect that given Hassan's long history of ""consistently providing moral and background support to the secessionists and terrorists within Kashmir and continuously fuelling and furthering, under the patronage of Pakistani proxies, separatist ideology within medical professionals of J&K"", he could well have been the mastermind and prime motivator of the doctors working for the Jaish module comprising the arrested Dr Muzammil, Dr Adeel, Dr Shaheen and Dr Parvez, besides the supposedly deceased Dr Umar. ""The Hassan link... is a validation of dismissals that J&K LG Manoj Sinha has been ordering under Article 311(2)c to dismantle the terror ecosystem. But it now seems some of these elements managed a free run outside J&K,"" said an officer.A source wondered how Hassan was immediately taken in by the Al-Falah University despite the public order by LG dismissing him for terror links. ""Were no pre-hiring background checks run on him? Or was the university aware of his controversial past but still hired him?"" asked an officer.Even Dr Shaheen was sacked by a Kanpur medical college for absence from duty, before being hired by Al-Falah. It is also intriguing how well-qualified Kashmiri doctors with MD degrees ended up working for the relatively unknown University at a nondescript location in Faridabad.As per the intelligence dossier prepared by J&K CID that had laid ground for Hassan's dismissal in 2023, he was a self-styled president of Doctors Association of Kashmir (DAK) for last eight years without having participated in DAK elections and used the forum to issue controversial media statements backing separatists and terrorists and exhorting Kashmiri youths, including medical professionals, to ""fight for the noble cause of freedom of Kashmir"". The dossier described Hassan as ""a potential time-bomb, which can be re-installed by Pakistan and its terrorist-secessionist network at any given point of time to cause widespread violence and disturbance against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India"".Hassan, as per J&K CID, ""clearly propagated a highly vicious ideology that so long Kashmir is part of India, nothing good can happen in Kashmir"". After four terrorists were killed by security forces when they attacked CRPF camp at Shopian in 2013, he ""had brazenly provoked people to come in support of 'terrorists' by labelling them as 'mujahids' fighting for the freedom of Kashmir from India."" An official said he was an associate of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and after the latter was hanged in 2013, he issued a press statement exhorting youth to start a new struggle until the Kashmir issue was resolved.Hassan had rejected the 2014 polls in Kashmir.He also said Kashmiri doctors will provide free of cost treatment to all victims of ""oppression"". In 2015, when he was suspended from SHMS hospital, separatists like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Yasin Malik had come in his support.","Nisar Ul Hassan was sacked by J&K LG Manoj Sinha in Nov 2023 from Srinagar's SHMS hospital over terror links.

SRINAGAR: J&K police intensified their sweeping operation to dismantle terrorist support networks and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), searching over 200 locations in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district and questioning more than 500 people, including a doctor, as the crackdown entered its fifth day Tuesday.The campaign across Kashmir valley has gathered pace after the unearthing of a “white-collar” terrorist network involving Kashmir-born doctors in Haryana’s Faridabad and UP, suspected to be linked to the November 10 car blast in New Delhi. In total, police have summoned over 1,500 people for questioning in recent days.Among those questioned was Dr Malik Tajamul-ul-Islam of Kulgam. His father said Malik, an MBBS graduate from Govt Medical College in Srinagar and preparing for his MD entrance exams, was called to a Srinagar police station.“They took his phone and asked about our cold storage facility in Kulgam and its finances,” the father told reporters. “He was released later, and I received him outside the station. He was only questioned about the cold storage.”A senior officer said the latest phase in Kulgam began early Wednesday, targeting JeI-linked members and their associates as part of efforts to “dismantle the terrorist ecosystem at the grassroots”.Searches covered homes of “over ground workers” and people whose relatives had migrated to Pakistan or PoK and allegedly joined outfits there.“About 500 people were interrogated. Many were bound down and shifted to Anantnag jail under preventive laws,” the officer said.Parallel searches in north Kashmir’s Sopore and south Kashmir’s Awantipora focused on JeI-linked people. Police reported seizing digital devices and “incriminating material” during these operations, while “several JeI members were questioned and detained under law”.In a related move, authorities ordered the attachment of the Srinagar home of lawyer Mian Abdul Qayoom, former president of J&K High Court Bar Association, in a 2009 case concerning an event marking Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s death anniversary. Police said Qayoom and others, including Asiya Andrabi and Shabir Ahmad Najar, made anti-India speeches and raised separatist slogans at the seminar in a Srinagar hotel.Police said witness statements established that the seminar’s participants had “provoked the audience, made inflammatory remarks, and advocated the secession of J&K”.Qayoom is currently jailed in the 2020 murder conspiracy case of lawyer Babar Qadri. He allegedly used his two-storey house and adjoining land at Bulbul Bagh in Barzulla to “conceal incriminating material and aid unlawful activities”, police said.A search of the property, conducted on a magistrate’s warrant, allegedly led to the confiscation of banned literature, a Hizbul Mujahideen letterhead with seal impression, a press note, a letter addressed by Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin to then US President Bill Clinton, and another Hizbul seal in Urdu.","J&K police intensify their sweeping operation to dismantle terrorist support networks and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami.

While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

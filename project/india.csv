NEW DELHI: A delay of over four years has pushed up the cost of the country’s first Bullet Train project by around 83% to Rs 1.98 lakh crore. The first leg of the project, between Surat and Bilimora, is scheduled to be inaugurated in Aug 2027, while the entire 508-km corridor is likely to be completed by Dec 2029.Responding to a question on the cost escalation for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai High Speed Rail Corridor project being implemented by NHRSCL, at a briefing on govt’s Pragati initiative, Railway Board CEO and chairman Satish Kumar said, “While the final sanction for the revised cost is yet to be taken, it’s around Rs 1.98 lakh crore. It’s still under revision... It will be finalised within a month or two.”Initially, the project was sanctioned at a cost of around Rs 1.1 lakh crore. The project has faced time and cost overruns due to different reasons, including delay in land acquisition, statutory clearances and finalisation of the rolling stock (trains).In a statement last week, railways said that overall physical progress in the project stood at 55.6% until Nov 30 and financial progress at 69.6%. Until Nov end, Rs 85,801 crore had been spent on the project. TOI has learnt that PM Narendra Modi , while reviewing work of railway ministry last month, had directed it to expedite completion of the project.Earlier on Friday, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw virtually witnessed from Rail Bhawan the final breakthrough in a 1.5-km-long mountain tunnel, a part of the project, in Maharashtra’s Palghar district. “A big milestone has been achieved today (Friday). This achievement is the breakthrough of the mountain tunnel 5,” he said.In an official release, the ministry said that it is among the longest in Palghar district, being located between the Virar and Boisar bullet train stations. “It is the second tunnel breakthrough in Maharashtra, as the first 5-km-long underground tunnel between Thane and BKC was completed in Sept 2025,” it said. The project passing through Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli is designed to operate bullet trains at a speed of 320 kmph.The corridor will also be fit for operating the advanced Japanese E10 series Shinkansen trains as it is being designed to allow trains to run at 20 kmph higher speed. Once completed, the corridor will lead to an estimated reduction of nearly 95% in carbon dioxide emissions compared to road transport.","The first leg of the project, between Surat and Bilimora, is scheduled to be inaugurated in Aug 2027.

NEW DELHI: The Bihar police on Friday arrested a person from Muzaffarpur for allegedly creating an Artificial Intelligence-generated, fake but viral video mimicking the voice of the President of India Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “to spread misinformation among the public with an intent to undermine high Constitutional offices, shake public confidence in democratic institutions and disturb social harmony and public order”.The accused, Pramod Kumar Raj, was arrested by a special team led by superintendent of police (cyber), which also seized his mobile used to created the fake video. “The mobile is being examined for further evidence,” the Muzaffarpur police said in a statement on Friday.Sources said Pramod has been working for social media cell of Jan Suraaj Party led by Prashant Kishor . He had managed social media publicity for the party during the Bihar assembly elections held last year.Some photographs of Pramod posing with Prashant Kishor surfaced on social media on Friday.The Muzaffarpur police, in its statement on the arrest, said: “The possibility of the AI-generated, fake digital content being created and circulated for anti-national purposes, spreading rumours and disruptng social harmony cannot be ruled out”.Keeping in view the sensitive nature of the case, a special team was set up under the supervision of of senior superintendent of police (SSP), Muzaffarpur, with by superintendent of police (SP), cyber, in the lead.

"Now, battery packs to get Aadhaar-like code",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-battery-packs-to-get-aadhaar-like-code/articleshow/126316131.cms,"AI-generated image for representation

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: In a move to track the origin and manufacturing of all batteries and help consumers get details of their life and performance, the govt has come up with proposed guidelines for Battery Pack Aadhaar Number (BPAN). Under this, every battery pack will have machine-readable, 21-character alphanumeric code and QR code storing all such details.The digital framework, which will work like a “battery passport”, is aimed at tracking batteries across their entire lifecycle, from manufacturing and use to recycling and disposal. While the guidelines focus exclusively on Electric Vehicle (EV) applications, they would be extended to industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2 kWh at a later stage. “Starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries and portable batteries are outside the scope of this document,” the draft guidelines said.On July 8, TOI had first reported the govt’s plan to have such a framework, after a series of incidents of electric two-wheelers catching fire stressed its importance.As per the proposed guidelines, the alphanumeric or QR code will contain static data such as battery material, descriptor and carbon footprint parameters, which will be accessible to public.This data remains unchanged unless there is a physical replacement of components or modification of the battery’s operational parameters by its management system.The battery’s dynamic data will be stored, maintained and updated via a server. It will give real-time insights into the battery's performance and health. Among the most critical of these parameters are the battery status, battery category, and State of Health (SOH). This will be accessible only to service provider, recycler, producer and authorised stakeholders.This additional feature would increase the battery cost by barely Rs 10 per unit compared to Rs 900 in Europe.Officials said that after finalisation of the framework, govt will come up with standards, with accountability being defined for each stakeholder in the entire chain. An official said this single move will further three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality.Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD, Luminous Power Technologies, called it a pivotal shift for India’s battery ecosystem, creating lifecycle transparency from manufacturing to end-of-life recycling. “This will further streamline quality assurance, boost traceability and support compliance with evolving global norms, while catalysing a more structured circular economy. The framework mirrors global thinking, as seen in initiatives such as Europe’s Battery Passport, positioning Indian manufacturers for future regulatory alignment, exports and responsible growth,” she said.While larger batteries used in mobility and energy storage are well positioned to adopt the changes at scale, implementation might be a bit complex for small-format batteries and low-capacity storage systems (below 3 kVA), particularly due to the need for physical identifiers like QR codes, Bajaj said.","The digital framework, which will work like a “battery passport”, is aimed at tracking batteries across their entire lifecycle.

Underwater tunnel across Brahmaputra gets govt nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-tunnel-across-brahmaputra-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/126315989.cms,"The tunnel would be of great strategic significance due to its proximity to Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China. (AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

Development won't be at cost of democracy: Cabinet secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/development-wont-be-at-cost-of-democracy-cabinet-secretary/articleshow/126315965.cms,"TV Somanathan

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.",Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan says development won't be at the cost of democracy. Comments come amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy.

New Labour Codes pre-published: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Features

Built for semi-high-speed operations, the Vande Bharat sleeper is designed to run at speeds of up to 160 kmph, while trial runs have been carried out at 180 kmph. Actual service speeds will vary depending on track infrastructure across the rail network.

Inspired by European train design standards, the Vande Bharat sleeper train coaches will feature cushioned berths for added comfort, along with better access to upper berths to make movement easier for railway passengers.

Onboard facilities include soft night-time lighting, public address systems integrated with visual information displays, CCTV cameras, and modular pantry units.

The train will be equipped with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Amenities will include toilets designed for persons with disabilities, a baby care area, and shower facilities with hot water in the air-conditioned first-class coach.

Safety enhancements include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the existing chair car variant, the sleeper version will also use regenerative braking to improve energy efficiency.

Coaches will have fully sealed gangways and automated inter-coach doors, helping maintain consistent air quality and stable cabin temperatures.

Each coach will be fitted with personal reading lights, power charging points, foldable snack tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will operate automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System is in place, along with emergency communication features that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive pilot when required.

Vande Bharat sleeper train to be launched soon! In a big New year cheer for Indian Railways passengers, railway minister Ashwini Vaishaw has announced that the first Vande Bharat sleeper train will be launched this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the Vande Bharat sleeper train in the second half of January 2026.Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned train set that has been manufactured by Indian Railways for long-distance routes and overnight journeys. According to Ashwini Vaishnaw , two Vande Bharat sleeper train sets are ready and have undergone successful trial runs. The new trains will be operated on 1,200-1,500 kmph routes of the national transporter.The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata, Ashwini Vaishnaw announced on Thursday. Each Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 coaches. The composition of the coaches is: 11 AC 3-tier, 4 AC 2-tier, and one AC 1st coach. The train can accommodate 823 passengers. Vaishnaw said that eight more Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out in the next six months, and the total will go up to 12 by year-end.The new train is scheduled to run between Howrah and Guwahati (Kamakhya). According to Indian Railways, the following districts will be benefitted:Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showcasing the train undergoing high-speed trials on the Indian Railways network.During test runs conducted on the Kota–Nagda route, the Vande Bharat sleeper train achieved its top design speed of 180 kmph. A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets. Separately, the Integral Coach Factory is also developing its own sleeper configuration of the Vande Bharat train as an internal project.",The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata. The train will be equipped with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

Rahul was visible, a little too much? A lookback at 2025

Mahatma Gandhi once envisioned a future where the Congress would quietly dissolve itself into a Lok Sevak Sangh after Independence, having fulfilled its role and returned power to the people. History, as it often does, chose drama instead. The party stayed on, grew older, heavier with legacy -- and now, at 140, finds itself older than independent India and still very much in the business of electoral survival.Founded in 1885, the Indian National Congress didn’t just witness the making of modern India; it scripted large parts of it. But fast-forward to the present, and the party that once defined the political centre is struggling to locate it. The slogans are loud, the marches long, the symbolism familiar—but dominance has been replaced by damage control, and nostalgia no longer guarantees votes.Now, stepping into its 141st year, the Congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong. A series of assembly elections across five states is lining up as its next reality check, testing whether fresh campaign calls, revived alliances, and lessons from a bruising 2025 can finally add up.From rebranding protest politics to fighting key battles in the south and the northeast, the grand old party is once again at the crossroads -- older, wiser, and under pressure to prove it still knows the way forward.Save the Constitution, vote chori, caste survey -- these are some of the battle cries Congress tried to campaign on. Rahul Gandhi walked miles for it. While the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha may have charmed those he walked with, the votes did not enter its account.2026, however, would see a break from these campaign calls as the Grand Old Party announced nationwide protests against the BJP-led central government for replacing the rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law.""We also pledge to democratically oppose every conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA,"" Mallikarjun Kharge said at the CWC meet as he announced the campaign from January 5.But the question is, would the people who need the scheme relate to ""conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA""?While the CWC release does highlight what it describes as the systematic dilution of MNREGA, including unilateral changes to the scheme’s structure without consultation or parliamentary debate, the beneficiaries in whose name the Congress is mobilising are unlikely to engage with or prioritise such detailed party statements.Out of the five states that are set to see ballot contests this year, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry remain the crucial ones for Congress. The party will directly face the BJP or the Left in these assembly elections.The party is riding on high confidence with a sweeping comeback in the Kerala local body polls. However, the BJP-led NDA's Trivandrum win cannot be ignored.The local body election results offer the Congress-led UDF a clear strategic edge heading into the upcoming assembly polls. A pronounced anti-incumbency wave has cut through the LDF’s welfare and governance narrative, pushing the Left to its weakest grassroots position in years and denting its push for a third consecutive term.While the BJP’s expanding footprint has complicated Kerala’s traditional bipolar contest, the erosion of LDF dominance gives the UDF momentum, credibility, and a renewed claim as the principal alternative as the assembly battle approaches.After its 2016 defeat in Assam—driven by deep anti-incumbency, alliance consolidation by the BJP, and voter frustration over corruption, jobs, and governance—the Congress is recalibrating its approach. This time, the party is foregrounding a grassroots-first strategy through its “Raijor Podulit Raijor Congress” campaign, aimed at rebuilding credibility from the bottom up. By crowdsourcing inputs for its manifesto via thousands of “aspirational boxes” and sustained community outreach across regions, the Congress is seeking to address precisely the issues that cost it power earlier: employment, fair wages for tea workers, flood management, public health, and governance delivery.At the organisational level, the Congress is also positioning itself as the anchor of a broad opposition alliance to take on the BJP, while trying to avoid the fragmentation that helped its rivals in the past.However, the decision to contest 100 of 126 seats has exposed fault lines within the alliance, making seat-sharing and coordination a key test of leadership. Balancing assertiveness with accommodation, translating consultation into votes, and countering the BJP’s entrenched narrative on identity and development remain the party’s central challenges as it looks to convert renewed mobilisation into an electoral comeback in Assam.Congress finds itself walking a tightrope within the DMK-led alliance. While it wants to improve its bargaining position by pressing for a higher number of seats, the party has to contend with its relatively weak independent base in the state and the DMK’s clear upper hand.The party’s challenge lies in projecting relevance and cohesion without appearing disruptive, ensuring smooth coordination at the grassroots for vote transfer, and managing internal ambitions—all while avoiding strain in a long-standing alliance that remains crucial for its electoral survival in Tamil Nadu.Conflicting actions by individual leaders, including high-profile meetings outside the alliance framework, have added to doubts about unity and discipline, even if these are intended mainly to strengthen Congress’s hand in talks.Congress heads into the West Bengal polls facing an existential challenge shaped by years of steady decline and shrinking political space. From being a significant player with strongholds in Malda and Murshidabad a decade ago, the party has slipped into near irrelevance, drawing a blank in the 2021 assembly election and losing even its traditional bases.This collapse has coincided with the BJP’s rapid rise as the principal opposition to the Trinamool Congress, leaving Congress squeezed out of the bipolar contest. Compounding the problem is Mamata Banerjee’s clear insistence on going it alone, shutting the door on any meaningful alliance and reducing Congress’s bargaining power to zero.With no dominant leader, weak organisation, and little clarity on whether it is fighting for seats, vote share or mere visibility, Congress enters the 2026 battle not just struggling to regain relevance, but fighting to remain a credible political force in Bengal at all.The recent remarks from within and around the Congress have given fresh momentum to the question of whether the party is informally sounding out Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a larger leadership option amid its ongoing churn.The letter by former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim, questioning Mallikarjun Kharge’s effectiveness and explicitly citing age and youth disconnect, reflects a deeper anxiety within sections of the party about stagnation and electoral drift.Endorsements of Priyanka—ranging from Imran Masood’s projection of her as a prime ministerial face to Robert Vadra’s acknowledgement of growing demands—suggest an undercurrent that sees her as a potential unifying figure who could reconnect the party with voters.Rather than a clear leadership challenge, the episode points to a Congress struggling to balance generational renewal, organisational reform and its continued reliance on the Gandhi family, with Priyanka emerging less as a declared alternative and more as a symbol of unresolved succession questions.2025 was a year of motion without payoff for the Congress. Rahul Gandhi’s 1,300-kilometre march through Bihar—spanning 25 districts and 110 seats—came loaded with slogans, symbolism, and carefully curated local flavour. From gamchas and Bhojpuri soundbites to makhana and motorbike rides, the outreach was exhaustive. The results were not. Voters showed up, but they did not line up behind the Congress, leaving the party staring at one of its weakest performances in the state and once again exposing the gap between optics and organisation.That disconnect played out across the electoral map. The promise of 2024’s Lok Sabha showing evaporated in the 2025 Assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi. Haryana slipped away amid factional squabbles and the absence of a decisive state leader.Maharashtra saw alliance fatigue within the MVA blunt Congress’s impact. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP’s machine, backed by Narendra Modi’s enduring pull, steamrolled Congress campaigns. Delhi remained a write-off. Jharkhand stood apart, where the Congress survived by riding on the back of a strong JMM alliance and a welfare-driven pitch—less a revival than a reminder of where the party still works.Rahul Gandhi ensured the Congress never vanished from the headlines, sharpening his attacks with claims of “vote chori” and warnings of systemic voter fraud. The rhetoric kept the narrative alive, but elections are won on the ground, not in press conferences. By the end of 2025, the verdict was hard to miss: the Congress can still set the conversation, but without organisational discipline and credible state leadership, it continues to lose the contest.","The Indian National Congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong.

Pulwama cricketer wears helmet with Palestinian flag sticker; cops start probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pulwama-cricketer-wears-helmet-with-palestinian-flag-sticker-cops-start-probe/articleshow/126311917.cms,"J&K cricketer wears helmet with Palestine flag

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K police have started a probe after videos went viral of a cricketer, Furqan Ul Haq, walking into a Jammu tournament wearing a Palestinian flag sticker on his helmet. The row also took on a political edge, with the PDP and others backing the Pulwama youth and BJP condemning the act as an attempt to incite “separatism”.The controversy broke Wednesday after Furqan strode in to bat at Jammu and Kashmir Champions League in Muthi, around 10km from Jammu city, for his team JK Eleven Kings with the flag emblazoned on his helmet. Some players of the rival team Jammu Trail Blazers raised strong objections, leading Furqan’s team to send him back and oust him from the match.On Friday, the police issued a statement confirming a preliminary inquiry to “ascertain the facts” Furqan’s “intent, background and any possible linkages”. The 14-day preliminary inquiry under Section 173(3) BNSS has been ordered given the sensitivity of the matter and its potential public order implications, the statement added. Furqan and the private organisers of the tournament were later called to Jammu’s Domana police station for the inquiry.Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) distanced itself from the controversy, maintaining that the tournament was a private event and not recognised by it. “JKCA has nothing to do with this. It involves local players. Even spectators are not allowed. Police will take necessary action,” JKCA official Anil Gupta said.While JKCA shrugged off the issue, politicians didn’t. Former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti posted a message in support of Palestine. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. A flag in the wind, bold and free, From the river to the sea,” Mehbooba wrote on X after reports about the police inquiry.Sheikh Khursheed, Awami Ittehad Party MLA and brother of jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid, called the police action “unjustified.” Khursheed said expressing solidarity with Palestine should not be treated as a crime, particularly when India has consistently supported the Palestinian cause internationally.Khursheed recalled that Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi had carried a bag bearing a Palestine symbol in Parliament without facing action. “If such expressions are acceptable for politicians, targeting a sportsperson for a symbolic gesture exposes selective outrage,” Khursheed said.BJP, however, denounced Furqan.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

BARUIPUR: ""I will make three ghosts walk,"" said Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee as he ushered in three people on stage - two men from Metiabruz in Kolkata and a woman from Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas - who he said had been marked dead during the SIR of Bengal's voter rolls.Flagging off Trinamool's campaign for the 2026 assembly election with a rally in Baruipur on Friday, Abhishek made it clear that SIR would be the front-and-centre of the party's poll pitch.Abhishek said, ""The day before yesterday, we visited the EC's office in Delhi. I asked (chief election commissioner) Gyanesh Kumar to publish the list of Bangladeshis whose names have been deleted. He couldn't do it. Instead, he raised his finger at me. I told him, you are nominated, we are elected. Who are you showing aggression to?""""They thought Trinamool would go on the backfoot if they showed slight aggression.

Abhishek added.Introducing the three people - Monirul Islam Molla, Harikrishna Giri and Maya Das - who were marked 'dead', Abhishek said there were many more such instances. ""In this (South 24 Parganas) district, 24 people who are alive have been shown dead by EC,"" he said.The TMC leader in Lok Sabha then went on to slam BJP, saying: ""In the name of logical discrepancies, 1.3 crore people were sent notices to attend SIR hearings. BJP can send (legal) notices to me and Trinamool workers. But why are notices being sent to common people? In 2016, they (BJP) made people stand in line for demonetisation.

SRINAGAR: J&K Police have initiated action against more than 100 people, including teenagers, for violating prohibitory orders on the use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.Cops Friday conducted a district-wide verification drive in south Kashmir’s Shopian, during which 15 people were identified using VPN services. According to police, detailed technical scrutiny and background verification did not reveal any terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered in the matter.“However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings were initiated against 10 individuals, primarily belonging to the younger age group, for violation of the said orders,” a cop said. Under these security measures, they were warned to refrain from using VPN services in the future. “Out of the 15 individuals identified, five were minors who were counselled and advised in the presence of their guardians, with emphasis on awareness, lawful digital conduct, and the consequences of violating lawful orders,” he added.In south Kashmir’s Kulgam and Pulwama districts, cops have identified 101 people who used VPN services in violation of prohibitory orders.In Kulgam, police said security proceedings have been initiated against six persons. In Pulwama, 95 people were identified using VPN, but technical scrutiny of their devices and background verification found no terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered. However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings have been initiated against 43 individuals, primarily in the 18–40 age group, for violating prohibitory orders.Earlier this week, police imposed a phased ban on VPN services across several districts in Kashmir Valley, issuing district-wise orders. VPN use was prohibited in Srinagar, Ganderbal, Kupwara, Shopian, Budgam, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, citing threats to national security and the possibility of their misuse to incite unrest.Following the imposition of restrictions, police have begun acting against violators. “How can I watch my favourite Irish and UK shows now? Is it only banned for illegal activity? I'm sure that The Graham Norton Show is not dodgy!” wrote a Facebook user in Srinagar in response.","Cops Friday conducted a district-wide verification drive in south Kashmir’s Shopian, during which 15 people were identified using VPN services.

What the agreement says

Why the annual exchange matters

Historical context

Limits of the agreement

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad. The agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126285389,imgsize-1364220,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"
"‘Abhishek following path shown by Rahul’: Congress, Trinamool spar over credit for exposing ‘vote chori’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abhishek-following-path-shown-by-rahul-congress-trinamool-spar-over-credit-for-exposing-vote-chori/articleshow/126309930.cms,"BJP Claims Rahul Gandhi Ties To ‘Anti-India’ Panel Over US Lawmakers' Umar Khalid Letter

NEW DELHI: The high-decibel “vote chori” campaign led by Rahul Gandhi , which had united the opposition cutting across party lines last year, now seems to have created a divide between them. This, after Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee claimed that the Congress and some other regional parties had failed to understand how the game of “vote chori” was happening through the process of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls under the watch of the Election Commission .The Trinamool leader also questioned the approach of these parties as he asserted that the “fight against vote chori was on the ground at the booth level and not on social media and TV channels.”The Congress reacted sharply to his remarks. And the charge was led by West Bengal leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been one of the strongest critics of Mamata’s Trinamool Congress. Adhir accused Abhishek, who is the nephew of Mamata Banerjee, of following Rahul Gandhi by walking on the path shown by the former Congress president to take credit.“Everyone in India and even across the world knows that it is Rahul Gandhi who had exposed ""vote chori” in elections and attacked the Election Commission and it was his sustained campaign that even forced the Supreme Court to intervene at least five times in the process of SIR. This nephew of Bengal is now trying to copy the agenda of Rahul Gandhi and take credit,” Adhir said, attacking Mamata’s nephew.Chowdhury, who is a former West Bengal Congress president, also alleged that Mamata’s nephew always attacked and abused the Congress while not saying anything against the BJP.""When he was called for questioning by the ED, he came out and attacked the Congress, not the ED or the BJP. Now, he went to the ECI office, and then, as he stepped out, he again abused the Congress. Let people see for themselves who he is working for. He doesn't say a single word against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" Adhir said.Congress’s reaction came after Abhishek Banerjee claimed that “vote chori” was happening through the electoral rolls and not the EVMs.“Vote chori is happening in voter lists through the electoral rolls and not in the EVMs.If the Congress and other parties could have caught this game, the BJP would have lost all the states it won last year. Such high strike rates of BJP in so many states were not a coincidence. Congress, AAP, RJD could not understand the game,” claimed Abhishek Banerjee.He claimed that opposition parties are failing to understand what ""algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove 50 lakh to 1 crore voters"" and said if this is not happening, the ""poll panel should release a list of 1.36 crore logical discrepancies.""Abhishek also went on to question the approach of these parties in highlighting the “vote chori” allegations. “Those who think that elections can be won by making a few strong remarks on TV channels have got it wrong. The fight is on the ground and you have to fight at the booth level to prevent it,” he said.Clearly, this was a strong message to the Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, who was the first to make “vote chori” allegations and tried very hard to make it an election issue in Bihar, but failed.Led by Abhishek, the Trinamool Congress has unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission. The Trinamool leader has locked horns with CEC Gyanesh Kumar over the process of SIR and has asserted that his party will not accept the electoral roll if the discrepancies are not removed.“Our position is unambiguous and non-negotiable: The entire list of voters branded under the vague and arbitrary label of 'Logical Discrepancy' must be published immediately, with clear Assembly-constituency-wise and category-wise break-ups. The criteria, methodology, and legal authority used to create this category must be placed in the public domain without delay,” the Trinamool has said after a heated meeting with the Election Commission on Wednesday.","Abhishek Banerjee claims Congress, AAP, RJD could not understand game of 'vote chori' West Bengal leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accuses Mamata's nephew of following Rahul Gandhi's path to take credit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126310144,imgsize-961807,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

What we know so far

Residents of the Bhagirathpura began reporting to hospitals across the city from Monday onwards, complaining of vomiting, high fever and diarrhoea.

Officials said the contamination occurred after sewage water from a toilet constructed at a local police check post seeped into the drinking water line.

After the outbreak, laboratory tests confirmed that the diarrhoea outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water.

According to Indore's chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani, the report was prepared by city-based medical college.

It claimed that the water collected from Bhagirathpura were contaminated due to a leak in a main supply pipeline.

However, officials were yet to identify the specific bacteria responsible.

Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav issued a statement saying, ""Following the stern action taken against the responsible officials in connection with the tragic incident caused by the supply of contaminated drinking water in Indore, we are also taking corrective measures for other places in the state.

The CM had also issued directions to get the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer. ""This morning, I reviewed the actions being taken by the state government in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the Chief Secretary and other officials, and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the Additional Chief Secretary (Urban Administration and Development).I issued directions to the Indore Municipal Corporation Commissioner and Additional Commissioner to issue a charge sheet notice in this regard, to immediately remove the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer of the duties of the Water Distribution Works Department. I also issued directions to fill the necessary posts in the Indore Municipal Corporation with immediate effect,"" said the CM.

Bhagirathpura, meanwhile, remains largely deserted. With more than 200 residents admitted to 27 hospitals across Indore, most families have been away attending to sick relatives.

After repairs and inspection, clean water was restored through the pipeline on Thursday. However, residents have been advised to boil water before consumption as a precaution.

Meanwhile, residents of Indore's Bhagirathpura area remain afraid of consuming even the tanker-supplied water following a contaminated drinking water incident that left several people ill and claimed lives.

Despite assurances from the municipal corporation and the deployment of water tankers, locals said that they didn't have trust in the water supply system.

""We had been complaining about dirty water for several days, but no one was listening and several people were falling ill. My daughter, Kanak Lashkari (15), is currently admitted to the Arvindo hospital. My mother, aged 93, fell ill on December 24, but after treatment she has now recovered. We are now buying water for drinking, and for other uses, we rely on government boring water. The municipal corporation is supplying drinking water via tankers, but we are afraid to consume it. We no longer have trust in this supply. This is destruction being carried out in the name of development,"" a local resident said.

Earlier, Madhya Pradesh Urban Development and Housing Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya stressed that micro-checking in the entire colony is in progress and will be completed in 8-10 days. ""There were possibilities of contamination of water with sewage; therefore, treatment had already begun earlier, and the same treatment continues now. Micro-checking is underway across the entire colony and will take 8 to 10 days..."", he said.

NEW DELHI: At least 10 people have died while more the 1,400 are affected due to a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water in Bhagirathpura area of Madhya Pradesh's Indore.“According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava told PTI.Madhya Pradesh CM also issued a statement assuring action and ordering removal of Additional Commissioner from Indore, and In-Charge Superintending Engineer from duties.This comes after – according to officials – a leakage was found in the main drinking water supply pipeline near a police outpost in Bhagirathpura, at a spot over which a toilet has been constructed. They claimed the leakage led to contamination of the water supply.According to locals, one of the victims, who was just six-month-old, died after he fell sick due to alleged consumption of contaminated water.According to the family, the child fell ill with diarrhoea on December 26 and was taken to a local doctor, who prescribed medication. The family brought the child back home after check-up, but on December 29, the infant suffered a high fever and died at home.","At least 1,400 are affected by a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water.

BJP Leader Attacks Shah Rukh Khan Over KKR's Bangladeshi Cricketer Amid Hindu Lynching in Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero. Shah Rukh Khan does not have a character.His actions have been those of a traitor,"" Rambhadracharya said.Soon after, BJP leader Sangeet Som called Shah Rukh Khan a “traitor” and accused him of investing money in a player from a country he claimed was “working against India”. Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed. At any cost, they will not be able to get Mustafizur Rahman to play here. Rahman won't be able to step outside the airport,"" Som told ANI.The response from Congress followed soon after. MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism. Hate cannot define nationalism. RSS must stop poisoning society.""The attacks come amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh.

Tribunal ruling mum on surplus flood waters, Andhra's projects cut into our share: Telangana

NEW DELHI: Disputes over sharing of river water among states is common, but India's newest state Telangana, while objecting to Andhra Pradesh's Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project (PBLP), has raised an interesting question before the Supreme Court - can a state unilaterally attempt to utilise flood water on an inter-state river? Telangana said the project violates the binding award of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and would deprive the residents of Telangana their due share of Godavari water, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Telangana said the tribunal award has not dealt with surplus flood waters and AP's projects, constituted in the guise of using flood water, would reduce the Godavari water share of Telangana.No mechanism exists in the country to determine whether a project utilises flood water or the assured share of water allocated to states by the award of a water disputes tribunal award, the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt said.Telangana said AP govt's decision to utilise more water through projects in the guise of harnessing excess flood water would have a chain reaction across the country. It said Karnataka intends to use more water of Krishna in the same manner which would accentuate water shortage for Telangana.""Maharashtra has also said that in case AP is allowed to plan projects based on flood waters, it would also like to plan projects on so-called flood waters.This would completely destabilise the utilisation pattern in the co-basin states violating the binding award of GWDT,"" it said.A bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Monday will hear a writ petition filed by Telangana govt which challenged the decision of the Central Water Commission (CWC) to grant consent to AP govt to prepare detailed project report for PBLP even though there had been no in-principle consent for project feasibility report (PFR), which must be obtained prior to preparation of DPR.The Polavaram project was to be executed on the Godavari river as per the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal which was to carry 80 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water to the Krishna river through its canal system for use in the Krishna delta system.""Now, instead of approved diversion of 80 TMC of water to the Krishna river, AP govt is expanding infrastructure of the Polavaram project without any approvals to carry additional 200 TMC (intended to increase to 300 TMC later) of water to the Krishna river and beyond through Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project/Polavaram- Nallamalasagar Link Project in the guise of carrying flood waters of the Godavari,"" it said.Accusing AP govt of undertaking expansion work for PBLP and PNLP prior to submission of pre-feasibility report to the CWC, Telangana govt said AP has floated tenders for undertaking work despite CWC specifically informing it to wait for approval of PFR. It requested SC to stay the tendering process initiated by AP and the ongoing expansion works of Polavaram Right Bank Canal.",India's newest state Telangana objects to Andhra Pradesh's Polavaram- Banakacherla Link Project (PBLP) It says the project violates the binding award of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and would deprive the residents ofTelangana of their due share of water.

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has held that even a third party can, depending on the facts of the case, challenge a lok adalat award through a writ petition if the award is alleged to have been secured fraudulently by excluding a proper and necessary party.The observation was made by Justice M Nagaprasanna while quashing a decree passed by a civil court in Hosapete, Vijayanagara district, arising from a compromise recorded before a lok adalat.The case is related to a land partition dispute in Kamalapur village. A compromise petition had been entered into before the lok adalat between Nagamma Nagalapura and the children of Karadantappa, both belonging to different branches of the family of Khemmani Hanumanthappa, the original owner of the properties. Guramma and her children, who also claimed to be part of the same family, were not arrayed as parties to the suit.Challenging the decree dated July 8, 2023, Guramma and her children contended that they were necessary parties and the compromise was entered into in collusion, with the intent of denying them their legitimate share in property. They had initially filed an appeal but withdrew it after being advised that an appeal was not maintainable against a decree drawn from a lok adalat compromise.They subsequently approached HC. Opposing the plea, the respondents argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as Guramma and her children were not parties to the original partition suit.After examining the records, provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and earlier judgments, Justice Nagaprasanna held that in certain circumstances, a third party is entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction to challenge a lok adalat award if fraud is alleged on the grounds that the party was deliberately not impleaded despite being necessary to the proceedings.Allowing the petition, the court ordered restoration of the civil suit before Hosapete court. It also directed that any financial transactions carried out pursuant to the compromise should be deposited before the trial court, remaining subject to the final outcome of partition proceedings.",Karnataka HC has held that even a third party can challenge a lok adalat award through a writ petition.

India News - The Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/boundless-welcome/articleshow/126307036.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar , the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Some verses take time to convince us. They sit patiently, waiting for the mind to ripen. As a teenager, I remember feeling faintly dissatisfied with a few couplets of Thiruvalluvar. They appeared lofty, even impractical. One such couplet was in the chapter on hospitality , a virtue the Tamil world has always treated not as etiquette, but as dharma. Valluvar wrote: “Viththum Idal Vendum Kollo Virundhombi Michchil Misaivaan Pulam” Is it necessary to sow seed in the field of the man who, having feasted his guests, eats what may remain? Couplet 85 puzzled me deeply. Why would a man who feeds others be exempt from sowing his own seeds? Was Valluvar exaggerating? Feeling that I was missing something essential, I asked my mother who asked my grandmother to tell us a story that afternoon. That day became my first introduction to the Nayanmaars, the 63 celebrated servitors of Shiva. And it came not from scripture, but a steel chatti of tangy puli saadam in our small Triplicane house. My grandmother was a large, imposing woman with a gentle voice. During summer vacations, lunch was always fed by her hand, and every meal came with a story. That day, it was the story of Ilayankudi Mara Nayanmaar. Maran was a devoted servant of Shiva, bound by a vow to feed visiting devotees every single day. His offerings were balanced with all six tastes. Over time, poverty crept in and debts mounted. Yet his resolve did not weaken. Hospitality, for him, was identity. One monsoon night, Maran and his wife lay hungry, having eaten nothing all day. Rain lashed the earth and the wind howled. At that moment, a visitor arrived — soaked, weary, and hungry. The couple welcomed him without hesitation. There was no food left in the house. No grain. No firewood. Maran’s wife reminded him of the paddy grains soaked in the field earlier that day, meant for sowing. A farmer’s most sacred possession. No farmer would dare touch them. But Maran did. In the storm, amidst slush and snakes, he walked to his field and gathered the wet grains. Back home, he cut a wooden beam from the roof and plucked greens growing around the house. A meal was prepared from almost nothing. A plantain leaf was laid and hot food served. When the couple invited the guest to partake of the meal, he did not step forward. Instead, he revealed himself as a sudden flash of light. Shiva appeared with Shakti, seated on the holy bull, blessing the devoted couple and granting them eternal grace. Years later, when I read this episode in the Periya Puranam , it returned to me with renewed force. Maran could have refused. His wife could have turned the guest away. What guided them was not even devotion to God — but unwavering commitment to the guest. Adithi devo bhava, virundhinar deivam — the guest as divine — is not a metaphor in our culture. It is a lived philosophy. My thoughts went back to Valluvar. He posed a question and gave an inherent answer. A person who the service to humanity as service to God, need not toil, need not sow the seeds. Perhaps because the universe sows for him. Perhaps because grace follows those who give without calculation. Or perhaps because hospitality itself is the richest harvest. Valluvar was not being illogical after all. He was simply seeing further than most of us do.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love.

Article 21

: SC

NEW DELHI: Underlining that an investigative agency must be given freedom to conduct a probe, Supreme Court has held that courts should ordinarily refrain from setting timelines for agencies to complete the investigation as it would amount to stepping on the ""toes of the latter"".A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said that courts should step in to impose timelines only if there is delay on part of the agency to wrap up the investigation. ""In sum, timelines are imposed reactively and not prophylactically,"" it said, quashing the order of Allahabad HC that set a timeline of 90 days for the state police to complete the probe in a criminal case pertaining to procurement of arms licences on the basis of forged documents.Supreme Court said judicial directives fixing timelines are warranted only where there is evident stagnation, unexplained inaction or a pattern of delay that cannot be justified by the nature or complexity of a case.Referring to various judgments of SC, the bench said, ""Necessary conclusion to be drawn from the discussion is that timelines are not drawn by court to be followed by investigators/executive right from the beginning, for that would clearly amount to stepping on the toes of the latter.Timelines are, therefore, imposed at a point where not doing so would have adverse consequences i.e. there is material on record demonstrating undue delays, stagnation or the like. ""At the same time, it stressed speedy trial, which necessarily includes timely and diligent investigation, has been recognised as an integral part of Art 21 of Constitution and cannot be ignored as it is essential to maintain fairness and credibility of criminal justice system.""The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the practical realities of investigation with constitutional mandate that criminal proceedings, from investigation through trial, be conducted with reasonable promptitude and care. It is this balancing role that judiciary plays. It is for those reasons that while on the one hand, there is a statutorily laid down process in place which is generally followed, powers such as that of Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure, have been kept open in their widest sense possible - to secure the ends of justice,"" the bench stated.Court said the process of investigation is long and winding and legal proceedings also frequently intersect with the investigation and affect its pace and direction, and hinted that it might be difficult to complete a probe within a fixed timeline.""Applications for anticipatory bail, regular bail, or the like can result in temporary pauses or changes in strategy. Courts may call for further investigation, ask for clarification on specific aspects, or even direct a change of the investigating officer. Each such intervention requires the investigating agency to revisit its work and sometimes take a fresh path altogether,"" it said.""So, it can be seen that the investigative process is at times straight, at other times one of lots of twists, turns and recalibrations and in yet others, frustratingly round-about like before it can come to a somewhat definitive conclusion to present the case for trial before the concerned, and sometimes, even at that time the definitive conclusion, at least from an investigator's standpoint, remains elusive,"" it added.",Supreme Court quashes order of Allahabad HC that set a timeline of 90 days for the state police to complete the probe in a criminal case.

Rent authority has jurisdiction even if tenancy pact absent: Allahabad HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rent-authority-has-jurisdiction-even-if-tenancy-pact-absent-allahabad-hc/articleshow/126315353.cms,"Allahabad HC

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad HC has held that absence of written tenancy agreement or not furnishing particulars of tenancy do not bar jurisdiction of rent authority. HC has also said that under Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Act, 2021, rent authority has jurisdiction to entertain a landlord's application for eviction of tenant where no written tenancy agreement has been executed and the landlord has also failed to furnish particulars of tenancy.HC emphasised state legislature's conscious decision to omit ""fatal consequences"" found in Central Model Tenancy Act ensured landlords were not deprived of their right to seek expedient eviction due to technical documentation failures.With this judgment dated Dec 16, HC partly allowed writ petitions filed by Canara Bank's branch office and others. The issue in writ petitions was whether rent authority, constituted according to the 2021 law, had jurisdiction to entertain applications filed by landlords in cases where a tenancy agreement had not been executed, if not executed, the landlord having failed to file particulars of tenancy with the rent authority.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal said, ""This provision leads to the conclusion that jurisdiction of rent authority under the Act of 2021 cannot be narrowed down only in cases of written agreement and its intimation to rent authority. Had the legislature thought of giving limited access to landlord or tenant to approach rent authority only in cases of written agreement or its intimation, then proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 9 would not have been there in the statute book.The intention of the legislature cannot be ascertained merely on the basis of single provision, and regard must be given to other sections as well as the context, subject-matter and the object of the provision.""On behalf of the landlord, it was argued the 2021 Act was intended to balance the rights of owners and tenants. They maintained the legislature deliberately omitted the ""consequences"" for failing to intimate an agreement to ensure landlords were not stripped of their right to seek eviction. Essentially, they argued rent authority should handle disputes even in unwritten tenancies to prevent the law's objectives from being frustrated by technicalities.HC observed the proviso further clarified the position to the extent that, in case of failure to present the agreement jointly or failing to reach an agreement, only particulars submitted separately with rent authority by the parties would suffice as to tenancy.For cases where eviction was sought directly under the new law, HC set aside orders that had previously deemed such applications non-maintainable due to a lack of written agreements. While some matters were remanded for fresh decisions, others resulted in eviction orders. In certain petitions, tenants were granted a six-month grace period to vacate the premises, provided they submitted a formal undertaking and cleared all financial dues.","Allahabad HC has held that absence of written tenancy agreement or not furnishing particulars of tenancy do not bar jurisdiction of rent authority.

Pak's belated assertion on conflict pause raises brows

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.At a press briefing on Thursday, Pak Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Andrabi, said Chinese leaders were ""in constant touch"" with Pakistan's leadership and had also made ""certain contacts with the Indian leadership in those three, four days in May, 6th to 10th and maybe prior to that and after that""""So, I think those contacts, which were characterised by a very positive diplomatic exchanges, they did constitute in bringing down temperatures and trying to bring peace and security in the region. So, I'm sure that the Chinese characterisation of mediation is correct,"" he said.Islamabad's statement, the first-ever about Beijing's alleged role in brokering the pause in the four-day conflict with India, should raise eyebrows because of the lag and because it had so far given the credit for suspension of hostilities exclusively to US President Donald Trump.India had maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan's DGMO to its Indian counterpart, and not the result of any third-party intervention.

A woman is heard asking her repeatedly if the professor touched her inappropriately, and she nods and says ""Yes"".In the video, which surfaced on social media Thursday, the woman seems to be in distress and finds it difficult to talk.Acting on a complaint filed by her father, Dharamshala police registered a case against the professor and three students under BNS Sections 75 (sexual harassment), 115(2) (causing hurt), and 3(5) (common intention), and Sec 3 of the Himachal Pradesh Educational Institution (Prohibition of) Ragging Act, 2009, on Thursday. The three women were classmates of the victim and are now in their second year, while the victim failed her first year exams.The father alleges that harassment by the professor and other accused pushed his daughter into depression. According to the complaint, on Sept 18 last year, the three female students harassed her and beat her during a ragging session.

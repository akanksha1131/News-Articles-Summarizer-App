Election Commission Reforms: Election Commission to implement electronic death data integration to clean voter rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-to-implement-electronic-death-data-integration-to-clean-voter-rolls/articleshow/120811080.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Introducing an important reform aimed at cleaning the electoral roll, the Election Commission on Thursday said it would obtain deaths registration data electronically from Registrar General of India, which maintains mandatory database of all births and deaths in line with the amendments made to Registration of Births and Deaths Act (RBD Act) in 2023. This would eliminate the dependence on field visits by the booth level officers (BLO) to gather data on dead voters in a household, so that they can be removed from the roll.The BLO will, however, still be required to make field visits to re-verify the information of deaths received from the RGI database, said an EC official.In two other reforms approved by commission on Thursday, the format of the voter information slips shall be revised to prominently display voter details; and standard photo identity cards issued to all BLOs to help the citizens recognise them and verify their identity. While the redesigned voter slip will make it easier for the electors to identify their polling station and for the polling officials to efficiently locate their names in the roll, the identity cards will help the citizens interact with BLOs more confidently during house-to-house visits for voter verification and registration.As per the system followed so far for dead voters, either their kin could apply through Form 7 for removal of the deceased elector from the roll, followed by a verification visit by the BLO, or the BLO would himself initiate the process during a field visit for roll updation. Form 7 would then be processed by the ERO to remove the dead voter permanently from the roll. However, this process sometimes involved a time-lag between death of a voter and his removal from the roll, creating scope for bogus or unnecessary entries.“The Commission will now obtain death registration data electronically from the RGI in line with Rule 9 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 and Section 3(5)(b) of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 (as amended in 2023). This will ensure that the EROs receive timely information about registered deaths. This will also enable BLOs to re-verify the information through field visits, without waiting for a formal request under Form 7,” EC said in a statement issued on Thursday.Sources said while the RBD (Amendment) Act, 2023, also allows RGI to share births database with the EC — since it can help ascertain when a citizen by birth turns 18 years of age and should be enrolled, this reform may need to wait longer as registration of births and deaths was made mandatory only in 2023. “For now, EC is focusing on getting data on deaths,” a senior officer told TOI.","The Election Commission on Thursday said it would obtain deaths registration data electronically from Registrar General of India.

Government to rank districts on road safety parameters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-rank-districts-on-road-safety-parameters/articleshow/120807285.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from the Swachhata ranking of cities, the govt will carry out ranking of districts on road safety parameters. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise which will also determine the best and worst performers.The minister issued this direction while chairing a day-long brainstorming session on road safety with officials from different ministries, state govts and experts. Sources said the ministry will work with the Niti Aayog to finalise the parameters.Gadkari also instructed officials to integrate “safe school zone” while planning construction and expansion of roads. District road safety committees (DRSCs) will include this provision while evaluating any plan, sources said. DRSCs will play a crucial role in the implementation of the Centre’s major schemes such as cashless treatment to road crash victims and giving financial rewards to good samaritans who take crash victims to hospitals for immediate medical care.Sources said responding to a suggestion on the need to have experts to assist DRSCs, road transport secretary V Umashankar said industry bodies such as CII and FICCI can extend their support.","Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise.

""It became a practice with them.

Navy intensifies muscle-flexing against Pakistan even as small arms fire continues across LoC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-navy-intensifies-muscle-flexing-against-pakistan-even-as-small-arms-fire-continues-across-loc/articleshow/120803512.cms,"NEW DELHI: Navy has further intensified its muscle-flexing against Pakistan by issuing another warning for ships to stay away from specified coordinates in the northern Arabian Sea due to its firing drills, as the exchange of small arms fire continues unabated between the rival armies along the Line of Control in J&K.The ""NavArea' warning for the specified zone off Gujarat till May 3, incidentally, is just around 80-85 nautical miles from where the Pakistan Navy is undertaking its own drills in the Arabian Sea. ""We have made it clear that if any warship or ship enters that zone, she will do so at its own peril,"" an officer said.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took stock of his force's operational readiness during a visit to the Western Navy Command in Mumbai Thursday. The review came even as Navy has deployed several warships in the Arabian Sea, which conducted multiple firings of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other weapon systems last week.China, which has the world's largest Navy with over 370 warships and submarines, is assiduously helping Pakistan build a strong maritime force. Pakistan has already inducted four latest Type 054A/P multi-role frigates and other platforms from China. It's slated to soon get eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines, with air-independent propulsion, in a major capability jump for India's western adversary.Amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, IAF is undertaking long-range day and night fighter sorties, while also keeping its air defence network with a variety of surface-to-air missile systems in full alert mode.While IAF has increased the number of ORPs (operational readiness platforms) at its air bases, especially in the western sector, the force is also slated to practice operations of supersonic fighter jets like Rafales, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s, transport aircraft and helicopters on an emergency landing facility (ELF) on the Ganga Expressway in UP on Friday.This will be the fourth such ELT on expressways in UP, and the first to support day and night landings. Such ELT airstrips being established in different parts of the country, with reinforced cement concrete construction on national highways or expressways, can provide operational flexibility during conflicts.If an adversary bombs air bases, for instance, such ELTs can be used for unhindered air operations using mobile air traffic and radar control, refueling and armament-loading facilities, say officers. Pakistan and several other countries like Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland, Poland and Singapore also have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies or war-like events.The ceasefire along the 778-km LoC and 198-km international boundary in J&K has frayed since the Pahalgam attack, with Army Thursday saying Pakistan army posts had opened unprovoked small arms fire across LoC in Kupwara, Uri and Akhnoor sectors.","Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took stock of his force's operational readiness during a visit to the Western Navy Command in Mumbai Thursday.

Developed under a public-private partnership by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the Rs 8,867-crore project is expected to significantly enhance India's cargo-handling capacity and reduce dependence on foreign ports like Colombo.Ahead of the inauguration, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a post on X that the port represents the largest investment ever made by any Indian state in a port project, with two-thirds of the cost borne by the Kerala government. He described the commissioning as a ""historic moment"" and a ""new chapter"" in India’s maritime development.Vizhinjam’s strategic location—just 10 nautical miles from a key international shipping route—and naturally deep waters make it ideal for accommodating large container vessels. Until now, 75% of India’s transshipment traffic was handled abroad, leading to foreign exchange losses. Vizhinjam aims to change that by reclaiming a substantial share of this traffic.The port boasts India’s first semi-automated operations, featuring AI-enabled vessel traffic management developed with IIT Madras, fully automated yard cranes, and remotely operated ship-to-shore cranes. Its breakwater—one of the deepest in the country—extends nearly three kilometres and stands 28 metres tall.Trial operations began in July 2024, and full commercial operations started in December. Over 272 large vessels have docked at the port during this phase, handling over 550,000 containers.Vizhinjam has already made significant gains, including becoming part of the Jade Service operated by MSC, the world’s largest shipping company. The port now shares routes with global hubs like Shanghai, Singapore, and Busan. Cargo ships on this route will sail from Singapore to Vizhinjam before heading to ports in Spain and Italy.With the first phase of development complete, the second phase—costing Rs 10,000 crore and fully funded by Adani Ports—is expected to be completed by 2028, taking annual capacity to 3 million TEUs.Plans are also underway to turn Vizhinjam into a multi-modal logistics hub, with direct highway connectivity via NH-66, Kerala’s first cloverleaf interchange, and an upcoming railway link to the national network.The Vizhinjam International Seaport, now operational, is being hailed as a major step forward in India's bid to become a global maritime power.","PM Modi will officially commission the Vizhinjam International Seaport on Friday.

I want to tell all the perpetrators of terrorism that this is not the end of the fight but only a turning point... ek makam hai, har vyakti ko chun-chun kar jawab milega, jawab bhi liya jayega (each one involved will be given a fitting response and will be held accountable too),"" Shah said in his first public speech after the slaughter of tourists at Pahalgam.Shah, who was addressing a meeting after the unveiling of the statue of Upendranath Brahma, a leading figure among the Bodos, in Delhi, asserted that the fight against terrorists and their backers would continue until each one of perpetrators is punished.Shah said BJP govt, under PM Modi's leadership, has effectively tackled terror threats everywhere - be it in the northeast, areas impacted by left-wing extremism, or in Kashmir - and has given befitting responses. ""If anyone thinks that a cowardly attack is their big victory, they must remember this is Narendra Modi's India - none will be spared. Our resolve is to uproot terrorism from every inch of India, and it will become a reality,"" he added.Soon after the terror attack, the home minister had rushed to Srinagar and visited Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam. He met the grieving families and vowed that the ""culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared"".Last week, the PM in his first remarks at a public event in Bihar, had issued a similar warning. ""We will go to the ends of the earth to find the perpetrators,"" he had said.Shah, in his address, said no Bodo should have an inferiority complex; they have the same rights in the country as the home minister himself.Recalling the signing of Bodo Accord in 2020 after nine months of discussions, Shah said everyone dropped their weapons and joined the mainstream. ""I want to tell all tribes that BJP govt honours the pacts it signs. We are implementing several agreements that were signed before us. They (earlier govts) did not follow them. We have cleared 96% of issues that were part of Bodo Accord. We will resolve 100% issues before next election in Assam,"" he added.The home minister said that Modi govt has signed over 20 accords in the northeast and over 10,000 people have surrendered and integrated inro the society. ""On an average, 78% of the issues have been resolved in the past four years... This shows what we do what we say,"" he added.Earlier, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma highlighted the progress made in the state under BJP rule and said that the state, which previously used to see violence, now hardly reports any incidents.","Home minister Amit Shah said terrorists are mistaken if they believe that by killing innocent civilians in Pahalgam, they have won the war.

Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar distanced the party from Ghosh’s actions, calling his visit a “personal decision” that the party did not endorse.Ghosh, who visited the temple with his wife, said there was no party directive barring attendance, and even if there had been, he would not have followed it. ""I like to visit temples, and the party cannot bar me from paying tribute to Lord Jagannath. Even if there was any whip, I would not have paid heed to it,"" he said. He also described the state government’s invitation as an ""honour"" and said that temple visits were part of Hindu cultural life.In contrast, Majumdar pointed to the recent violence in Murshidabad, saying the BJP had collectively decided not to attend the temple’s inauguration in protest. Adhikari declined to comment directly on Ghosh, stating only that he responds to remarks or actions by Mamata Banerjee.The divergence in approaches has led to criticism from some party leaders, including MP Saumitra Khan, who took to social media to attack Ghosh’s decision.

NEW DELHI: More than 32 years after a man sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl, the long arm of the law finally caught up with him as Supreme Court overturned a trial court verdict acquitting the then 21-year-old, who is now 54, and ordered him to undergo a 10-year sentence.""We would like to know who this daredevil sessions judge is who acquitted the man despite forensic science laboratory report, and statements of doctors and duty magistrate corroborating the girl's version of sexual assault,"" SC said while upholding a Gujarat HC decision to set aside the trial court verdict.A year after the incident, the additional sessions judge, Ahmedabad (rural), in Oct 1994 acquitted the man, who was charged with sexually assaulting the girl in an agricultural field. The injured girl was taken to hospital and the relatives waited for the sarpanch to come to help them in filing the FIR. Medical examination proved she was raped.The trial court, without taking into consideration the circumstances, had recorded the delay of 48 hours in FIR registration as one of the grounds for acquitting the accused.The appeal filed by the state in HC remained pending for 30 years. Finally, a bench of Justices Aniruddha P Mayee and Divyesh A Joshi, on Nov 14 last year, set aside the trial court decision to acquit the man. It convicted him under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs 10,000.Rejecting arguments for not imposing any sentence after 31 years on the man, who is now married and has a family to support, HC had said, “If a perpetrator of a crime is set free, the concept of deterrent theory may not work and there might be adverse effect on society. Moreover, it is a 10-year-old girl who was subjected to sexual assault.” The SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, agreeing with the HC judgment, revoked its order of Nov 14 last year and ordered the convict to surrender within a week.","Supreme Court overturned a trial court verdict acquitting the then 21-year-old, who is now 54.

India's billion plus stories will fuel economic growth: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-billion-stories-will-fuel-eco-growth-pm-modi/articleshow/120803193.cms,"Dream big & tell your story: PM to creators & investors



MUMBAI: Today, when the world is looking for new ways of storytelling, India with its ""timeless treasures"" can help build an Orange Economy of content, creativity and culture, PM Modi said at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai Thursday.Stressing on the event's potential as a platform for entertainers and investors to connect and collaborate, he said it could transform India into the world's third-largest economy.The arc of Indian cinema beginning with Dadasaheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra in 1913, the PM said, has widened over the years with the popularity of Raj Kapoor in Russia, Satyajit Ray at Cannes and the Oscar-winning RRR.The creative economy 's contribution to GDP is set to increase significantly, he said.India is not only home to a billion-plus population, but also a billion-plus stories,” said the PM, adding that every street in the country has a story, every mountain carries a song, and every river hums a tune. Cautioning against potential dehumanisation resulting from technological advancements in the creative industries, Modi stressed the necessity of retaining emotional depth and intellectual richness in expression.Advising creators and investors to “dream big and tell your story”, he urged them to invest in people, not just platforms. “We must not turn humans into robots; instead, we must make them more enriched and sensitive,” he said, noting that genuine progress should factor in the arts—including music, dance and painting — not just information, technology, or speed.As an example, Modi cited the $430-billion global animation market which is projected to double in the next decade. The PM said this presents a significant opportunity for India’s animation and graphics industry, which could leverage the expansion for greater reach. “Indian films have now reached audiences across the globe. Today, Indian films are screened in more than 100 countries. Foreign audiences are not just watching Indian films but also trying to understand them. A notable aspect of Indian cinema is that many international viewers are watching Indian content with subtitles. India has become a global hub for film production, digital content, gaming, fashion, and music,” he said, pointing to the tenfold growth in the OTT segment in recent years.India is a world leader in global fintech adoption and the second-largest mobile manufacturer, he added, showing the way forward in other areas such as the creative fields. He also noted Indian cuisine’s global popularity and expressed confidence in similar recognition for Indian music — ‘Khaana’ is becoming popular worldwide; similarly, ‘gaana’ also has tremendous potential for growth, said Modi.The Centre has now allocated Rs 400 crore to build the first Indian Institute of Creative Technology (IICT) in Mumbai, a decision that was reiterated by Information and Broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw at the event. IICT is all set to become a national hub for the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality sector. Work on the institute has already commenced. “IICT has aligned with a few tech giants for collaborative efforts towards courses. These include NVIDIA, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Star India, and Adobe,” said Vaishnaw. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said Mumbai’s Film City, spread over 500 acres, is being developed into a global centre for next-generation studio ecosystems. Of this, 120 acres will be dedicated to a media and entertainment city focused on animation, visual effects, and gaming, he added. IICT is being established by the I&B ministry, in strategic collaboration with FICCI and CII, as a national Centre of Excellence on the lines of IITs and IIMs.Modi also unveiled postage stamps in memory of Gurudutt, P Bhanumathi, Raj Khosla, Ritwik Ghatak, and Salil Chowdhury on the occasion for their contributions to Indian cinema.",PM Modi spoke at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai.

Condemn attack, revive direct talks: Rubio to Pak

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack as it asked both countries to avoid any flare-up and work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but secretary of state Marco Rubio “encouraged” India in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout of the talks from the Indian side but Jaishankar himself said in a laconic post on X after his talks with Rubio that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the terrorist attack must be brought to justice. Rubio had spoken to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating “this unconscionable attack”. The state department’s Hindi account on X said in a post on Thursday evening that under US President Donald Trump those who support terrorism will have to face consequences.“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,’’ said the US readout.The state department readout of the Rubio conversations seemed carefully worded as it said in the case of Pakistan that while urging it to work with India for peace, Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack , something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Pakistan for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah. The 2 countries also plan to hold a counterterrorism dialogue in June this year.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which also have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.US President Donad Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators. However, he later also said he’s close to both India and Pakistan and that they’ll themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.","The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Police said he is wanted in a case registered in Budgam under UAPA sections 10, 13, and 39, which relate to membership of unlawful associations, involvement in unlawful activities, and support to a banned terrorist organisation, respectively.Police said Fai is “concealing himself in the US”, and has “persistently evaded arrest, obstructing the legal process and avoiding accountability under the law”.On July 19, 2011 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested Fai, along with a Pakistani American, Zaheer Ahmad. They were charged with falsifying, concealing and covering up material facts as they lobbied with US govt without disclosing that they were being funded by Pakistan govt, including its spy agency ISI.On Dec 7, 2011, a statement by the US department of justice said Fai had “pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax violations in connection with a decades-long scheme to conceal the transfer of at least $3.5 million from the govt of Pakistan to fund his lobbying efforts in America related to Kashmir”. The statement further said: “Fai served as the director of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC), a non-governmental organisation in Washington, D.C., that held itself out to be run by Kashmiris, financed by Americans and dedicated to raising the level of knowledge in the United States about the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. But according to court documents, KAC was secretly funded by officials employed by the govt of Pakistan, including the ISI directorate.”In March 2012, a US court sentenced him to two years in prison for a “conspiracy to defraud the US”. However, in Nov 2013 he was released by the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, as the court reduced his sentence to 16 months.","Ghulam Nabi Fai, secretary general of Washington D.C.-based World Kashmir Awareness Forum, was declared a proclaimed offender (PO) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.

"Bordered by greed: J&K cop, siblings nearly deported over land grab plot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bordered-by-greed-jk-cop-siblings-nearly-deported-over-land-grab-plot/articleshow/120801866.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K police head constable Iftkhar Ali believes it was a land dispute that nearly tore apart his life, his family, and his identity as an Indian citizen. A distant relative, he claims, manipulated authorities to serve deportation notices to him and eight of his siblings — all in an alleged bid to seize their ancestral property of 17 acres in J&K Poonch district.“I think a revenue official, who is our distant relative, influenced the authorities and they sent us notices without confirmation. He wanted to grab my land. It should be investigated,” Ali said Thursday. “How can a conspiracy driven by greed for land rob me of my children, my country, and put us to such agony?”The 45-year-old head constable posted at the Vaishno Devi shrine’s Katra base camp was on official duty in Jammu on April 26 when he was handed a deportation order by local police. The notice, issued by the Poonch DC, directed him and his siblings — three brothers and five sisters, all between 45 and 65 — to leave India by April 29 and cross into Pakistan.“The notice was in my hand and suddenly, from a police officer I became a person without a country,” Ali said.The orders followed the Centre’s directive to identify and deport Pakistani nationals in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Somehow, despite his govt job and decades of residency, Ali’s name was included.His department intervened, sparing him from immediate deportation and keeping him at Gandhi Nagar police station in Jammu. His siblings, however, were put on the road to the Attari border in Punjab. At home, his wife Shahnaz Kousar and their three children — 12-year-old Nawaish, 9-year-old Ayaan, and 7-year-old Ziyaan — were left in anguish.“I cannot describe how I have spent the past seven days. I was living a hell,” Ali said. “When a man dies, he is buried in a grave. Here I am alive and I was thinking I couldn’t be with my children ever.”Ali’s roots in India run deep. His father Faqir Din was a hereditary state subject and an Indian citizen under the 1955 Citizenship Act. During the 1965 war, Din and his family were forced into PoK when their village Salwah came under Pakistani control. There, six more children, including Iftkhar, were born. The family returned to J&K in the 1980s and were officially granted state subject status in 1997.On April 29, J&K high court stayed the deportation. “Outside the police station in Poonch on Thursday evening, I felt back in life,” Ali said. “I am happy now, but will the trauma of this week live with us for long?”","J&K police head constable Iftkhar Ali believes it was a land dispute that nearly tore apart his life, his family, and his identity as an Indian citizen.

Why This Trade Makes Sense

For the Lakers:

For the Celtics:

Theare gearing up for a crucial offseason after a disappointing first-round exit in the 2025 NBA Playoffs. With LeBron James and Luka Doncic leading the charge, the front office is exploring bold moves to strengthen the roster—including a potential blockbuster trade with archrivals, the Boston Celtics .Fresh off their 2024 NBA championship, the Celtics face a challenging offseason. Financial constraints and an aging core may force Boston to shake up their roster.""The rest of the league is bracing for some level of change to the Celtics' roster this offseason,"" ESPN’s Shams Charania reported. ""Sources have been telling me for weeks now that the Celtics will be exploring trade options.""According to Dean Simon of the Sporting News , this opens the door for the Lakers to target a key Celtics star: two-time NBA champion Jrue Holiday.Jrue Holiday, a two-time All-Star and six-time All-Defensive Team selection, brings elite defense and veteran leadership—qualities the Los Angeles Lakers desperately need. Here’s how he could impact the team:- Defensive Anchor: Holiday’s ability to guard multiple positions would mask Doncic’s defensive limitations.- Playoff Experience: A proven winner, he’s averaged 11.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists this season.- Leadership: His intangibles make him an ideal fit alongside James and Doncic.To acquire Holiday, the Lakers may offer a package centered around Austin Reaves, who averaged 20.2 PPG this season. The deal could include:- Austin Reaves (20.2 PPG scorer)- Rookie forward Dalton Knecht- Jarred Vanderbilt- Draft capital- Adds a lockdown defender and playoff-tested veteran.- Balances the roster without sacrificing too much scoring.- Sheds Holiday’s $37.2 million player option for 2027-28.- Gains a young scorer in Reaves and future assets.Landing Jrue Holiday could propel the Los Angeles Lakers back into title contention. His defensive prowess and championship pedigree align perfectly with the team’s win-now mentality. As Dean Simon noted in the original report, this move might be the missing piece for Los Angeles to chase their 18th NBA championship.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler With the Celtics potentially open for business, the Lakers have a rare chance to weaken a rival while bolstering their own roster.

With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers’ indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won’t be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Aaron Rodgers’ choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Kirk Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk. Either way, Pittsburgh Steelers appears committed to making a bold move at quarterback in 2025.","Pittsburgh Steelers have reportedly offered Aaron Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million.

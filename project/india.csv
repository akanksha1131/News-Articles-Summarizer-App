'Threat to my life and that of my family': Abu Azmi calls Maharashtra assembly suspension arbitrary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threat-to-my-life-and-that-of-my-family-abu-azmi-calls-maharashtra-assembly-suspension-arbitrary/articleshow/118748395.cms,"Abu Azmi (ANI file photo)

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi , who has been suspended for the entire duration of the ongoing Maharashtra budget session over his remarks on Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, has called the decision arbitrary and raised concerns about threats to his life and family.Azmi took to social media platform X to express his concerns, saying, ""My suspension is arbitrary on the part of the government, there is a threat to my life and that of my family. Two laws are in force in Maharashtra, if democracy has ended in Maharashtra then the government can do anything to the public and the elected representatives of the public.""Earlier, Azmi had expressed his disappointment over the suspension and stated that he was willing to withdraw his remarks to ensure the smooth functioning of the Assembly.He said, ""To ensure that the House functions, I spoke about withdrawing my statement. I did not say anything wrong. Still, there is a controversy and proceedings of the House are being stalled. To ensure that the House functions and some work is done during Budget Session...I withdrew the statement that I made outside the Assembly, not in the House. Still, I have been suspended.""Azmi has received support from Samajwadi Party supremo and former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav , who criticised the suspension as a violation of freedom of expression.""If the basis of suspension starts getting influenced by ideology, then what difference will there be between freedom of expression and subjection? Whether it is our MLAs or MPs, their fearless wisdom is unmatched. If some people think that by 'suspension' one can rein them in, then this is the childishness of their negative thinking,"" Yadav said.The suspension was announced by Maharashtra assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar on Wednesday following a proposal in the assembly against Azmi’s remarks on Aurangzeb. Parliamentary affairs minister Chandrakant Patil stated in the House that Azmi's ""objectionable statement"" had hurt the dignity of the assembly, leading to the decision.Azmi had reportedly said that Aurangzeb was not a ""cruel administrator"" and had ""built many temples."" He also claimed that the conflict between Aurangzeb and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was about governance and not religion.His comments sparked widespread outrage, particularly among Shiv Sena leaders and supporters, who have vowed to continue their protests across Maharashtra.Defending his remarks, Azmi later clarified that he had only repeated what historians and writers had documented about Aurangzeb. He stated that his comments were not intended to be against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or Sambhaji Maharaj and insisted that his ""words were twisted.""""My words have been twisted. I have said what historians and writers have said about Aurangzeb Rahmatullah Alaih. I have not made any derogatory comment about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Maharaj or any other great men - but still if anyone has been hurt by my statement, then I take back my words, my statement,"" he said in a video posted on X.Meanwhile, SP's ally and INDIA bloc partner, Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray criticised Azmi, saying, ""He should be permanently suspended. It should not just be for the Budget Session, the suspension should be permanent.""","Abu Azmi has been suspended for the entire duration of the ongoing Maharashtra budget session.

'True chauvinist and anti-nationals are Hindi zealots': Tamil Nadu CM Stalin's fresh attack on NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/true-chauvinist-and-anti-nationals-are-hindi-zealots-tamil-nadu-cm-stalins-fresh-attack-on-nep/articleshow/118747036.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has once again taken a strong stand against the BJP-led central government. On Thursday, he used a famous quote to target the Centre's stance on language policy, saying:""When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.""In his post on X, Stalin said that this quote reminded him of how some ""entitled bigots"" brand Tamil Nadu’s demand for linguistic equality as chauvinistic and anti-national. He accused BJP leaders of questioning the patriotism of the DMK government , despite its contributions to national causes, stating, ""The very people who glorify Godse’s ideology have the audacity to question the patriotism of DMK and its government that contributed the highest amount of funds during the Chinese Aggression, Bangladesh Liberation War, and Kargil War, while their ideological forefather is the one who assassinated 'Bapu' Gandhi.""Stalin continuing his attack on Centre, said that demanding linguistic equality should not be considered chauvinism, adding, ""Chauvinism is naming the three criminal laws that govern 140 crore citizens in a language that Tamils cannot even pronounce or comprehend by reading. Chauvinism is treating the state that contributes the most to the nation as second-class citizens and denying its fair share for refusing to swallow the poison called NEP.""He warned that forcing any language upon people creates enmity and weakens national unity. ""The true chauvinists and anti-nationals are the Hindi zealots who believe their entitlement is natural but our resistance is treason,"" he said.A day earlier, Stalin had also criticised the Centre, urging it to take meaningful steps to support the Tamil language rather than engaging in symbolic gestures. He questioned the BJP’s claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has great love for Tamil, arguing that such sentiments are not reflected in action. ""If the BJP's claim that our Hon'ble PM has great love for Tamil is true, why is it never reflected in action?"" he asked.He called on the government to consider concrete measures instead of symbolic acts, stating, ""Rather than installing Sengol in Parliament, uninstall Hindi from Union government offices in Tamil Nadu. Instead of hollow praise, make Tamil an official language on par with Hindi and allot more funds for Tamil than a dead language like Sanskrit.""In response, BJP Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai questioned the DMK’s efforts in promoting Tamil beyond the state’s borders. ""What were your achievements in propagating our Tamil language beyond the borders of TN while in power in the State and the Centre? Did anyone obstruct DMK from doing it?"" he asked.He also pointed out that the Tamil Development Centre programme was launched by the previous AIADMK government and challenged Stalin’s role in expanding it. ""What efforts have you taken to roll out the Tamil Development Centre programme commenced by the previous AIADMK regime?"" he added.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has once again taken a strong stand against the BJP-led central government.

Fount of prosperity at Sangam? Boatman 'earned Rs 30 crore in 45 days of Maha Kumbh',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fount-of-prosperity-at-sangam-boatman-earned-rs-30-crore-in-45-days-of-maha-kumbh/articleshow/118746846.cms,"Pintu Mahara, his brother and mother Shuklavati Dev

PRAYAGRAJ: A wooden boat glided smoothly towards Sangam - the sacred confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and invisible Saraswati. Rhythmic chants of ""Har Har Gange"" blended with the gentle splash of oars. At the helm stood Pintu Mahara , guiding his passengers towards their spiritual rendezvous and his destiny toward prosperity.For Pintu and his kin, the 45-day Maha Kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.CM Yogi Adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the UP assembly on Tuesday and claiming the family's earnings touched Rs 30 crore. Pintu remained discreet about the figure but admitted it was an ""unprecedented"" windfall.It was no mere stroke of luck but the result of sharp business acumen honed over years. Recalling the bustling crowds of 2019 Kumbh, Pintu sensed the winds shifting and prepared to ride the crest of this spiritual wave. The boatman from Arail ghat made a bold and calculated gamble: he expanded his fleet from 60 to 130 boats. Each vessel, manned by a member of his extended family, ferried eager pilgrims across the holy waters.""Millions of devotees arrived in Arail, which resulted in a rise in our income,"" he said. A ride for 10 passengers, usually priced at Rs 6,000, soared to as much as Rs 30,000 during the peak of Kumbh.For Pintu's mother Shuklavati Devi, the change was nothing short of divine intervention. ""The family was in financial doldrums after the death of my husband. In such a situation, Maha Kumbh came as a saviour,"" she said.Pintu's success was not an isolated tale. More than 4,500 boatmen, many from nearby districts like Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh and Bhadohi, saw their earnings swell, turning their once-humble occupation into a thriving business.","The 45-day Maha Kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.CM Yogi Adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the UP assembly on Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118746915,imgsize-975683,width-400,resizemode-4/118746915.jpg"
ED summons 11 deported from US for quizzing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-summons-11-deported-from-us-for-quizzing/articleshow/118746800.cms,"Photo/Agencies

CHANDIGARH: In a bid to zero in on travel agents involved in selling the 'American dream' to Indian residents and sending them to US through 'dunki' routes, ED on Tuesday sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the US recently.It has also initiated a probe under PMLA to trace the proceeds of crime.Well-placed sources told TOI that ED asked the 11 to appear at its office in Jalandhar on different dates, and ""at least one"" of the 11 was from Haryana, while the rest were from Punjab.According to preliminary data gathered by state officials after interviewing Punjab deportees at Amritsar airport, more than Rs 44 crore was paid to travel agents, with each person shelling out Rs 40 lakh-Rs 50 lakh on an average to reach the US illegally.A total of 131 deportees belonging to Punjab arrived in four batches after the Trump administration started mass deportation of ""illegal aliens"" soon after taking over on Jan 20.The sources said ED began the investigations by arranging details of the deportees ""on its own"".Of the 15 cases it initially analysed, it managed to get the ""details and addresses of 11 deportees"".Punjab Police have registered around two dozen FIRs on the complaints of the deportees, and ED has not yet officially sought any details from them, the sources said. The debriefing of deportees and the police complaints lodged by them point to a well-oiled network of agents who operate the 'dunki route' in a chain that involves touts and agents in several countries. This network makes the prospective illegal immigrants traverse through air routes, forests and rivers to reach Mexico, and then cross over to the US.The deportation flights to India started last month, with the first batch of 104 illegal immigrants, of which 31 were from Punjab, landing in Amritsar on Feb 5 on a US military plane. The second flight, which landed on the night of Feb 15, had 116 illegal immigrants, including 65 from Punjab. On the third flight that landed on Feb 16, 31 of the 112 deportees were from the state. The last batch of 12 deportees arrived on Feb 23 on a commercial Turkish Airlines flight originating from Panama. The flight landed in Delhi, and four from Punjab were part of this group."," ED has sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the US recently.

"Why afforestation funds used to buy laptop, iPhone? SC to Uttarakhand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-afforestation-funds-used-to-buy-laptop-iphone-sc-to-uttarakhand/articleshow/118746779.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exception to the Uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds and penalties paid for diversion of forest land, that were to be utilised for re-creation of forest, for purchase of laptops, iPhones, fridges and coolers, and sought the state govt's response within a fortnight.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar placed the CAG report on utilisation of the CAMPA funds before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran. The report said: ""At the divisional level, Rs 13.9 crore were diverted/expended on inadmissible activities like state scheme-Harella, tiger safari work, renovation of existing buildings, expenses on personage visits, court cases, purchases of iPhone, laptops, fridges, coolers, stationary, etc.""The bench said, ""Utilisation of huge funds from CAMPA for such inadmissible items and activities is a serious matter. We direct the chief secretary to file an affidavit by March 19 explaining how such huge funds were spent on such activities. If we do not get a satisfactory answer, we may require his personal presence in court on March 20.""Diversion of CAMPA funds to the tune of Rs 2.7 cr was made at Kalagarh Tiger Reserve for construction of internal path/six-metre-wide tiger safari road, modernisation of forest rest house, construction of forest guard chowkis and elephant protection wall, watch towers as well as removal of lantana. The CAG said, ""These activities were not permissible under Rule 5(4) of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and conditions in the approved Annual Plan Operations by National Authority."" The CAG evaluates the effectiveness of CAMPA and implementing agencies during 2019-22 in implementing the Act and Rules made thereunder.The CAG also flagged the inequitable distribution of CAMPA funds. It said, ""The release of funds was unrealistic and not commensurate with the approved Annual Plan of Operations. The state authority failed to ensure equitable and need based funding of activities in all the implementing agencies.""""There was inefficiency/ineffectiveness in funds release, not adopting accounting procedures as per Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and not discharging of interest liability. Besides, the state authority did not control the diversion/inadmissible expenditure from the state compensatory afforestation fund,"" it added.The CAG also noticed that the afforestation activities in the state have yielded low returns. ""The overall average survival percentage of plantations was 33.5% which is lower than the mandated 60 to 65%. In the test checked three divisions - Nainital, Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag, the survival rate at plantation sites was very low mainly because of non-suitability of the landscape or poor advance soil work before plantation,"" it said.","The Supreme Court took strong exception to the Uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds.

Arvind Kejriwal's Punjab visit for vipassana stirs 'luxury' row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwals-punjab-visit-for-vipassana-stirs-luxury-row/articleshow/118746442.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: BJP and Congress launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal questioning scale of the security convoy that accompanied him on Tuesday as he arrived in Hoshiarpur in Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat and his continued access to privileges even as he holds no office.AAP returned fire alleging that BJP was engaging in an ""unnecessary slander campaign"" and claimed that Kejriwal was accompanied by security as per the Z plus security cover approved by the ministry of home affairs. Hoshiarpur SSP Sandeep Kumar Malik said Kejriwal was Z-plus protectee and the security cover was provided to him accordingly.Since losing Delhi polls, this is the first time Kejriwal has left Delhi and his decision to choose Punjab for Vipasanna meditation has yet again given rise to speculations of whether he is now looking at a bigger role in Punjab.Last week, the surprise announcement by AAP of its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora's candidature for contesting the yet to be notified bypoll for Ludhiana West constituency in Punjab on Wednesday triggered speculation that the vacancy in Upper House was being created to eventually make way for Kejriwal's entry to Parliament. AAP leadership rejected the claim.A fresh controversy broke out when a video showing Kejriwal's 21-vehicle cavalcade went viral online on Wednesday as it entered the forest rest house in Chauhal, Hoshiarpur, on Tuesday night. Another video of him going to a vipassana centre in Anandgarh village, 12 km from Hoshiarpur, emerged in which the vehicle count was close to two dozen.""After losing the election, he is now looking for a Rajya Sabha seat because he is addicted to a luxurious lifestyle. Vipassana is just an excuse, the real reason for his presence in Punjab is the turmoil in AAP's Punjab unit,"" Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva alleged as he spoke to PTI Videos.Congress too stepped up its attack on AAP with Punjab leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa and other representatives alleging that Punjab's resources were being blatantly misused while AAP had no qualms in flaunting VVIP culture. They highlighted that when AAP formed a government in Punjab, Kejriwal and Mann said that those who demand security should leave politics.","Arvind Kejriwal is in Hoshiarpur in Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat.

During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat Kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.

However, the turnout for the subsequent matches has been very good. The ticket sales were around 95% (of the capacity). Maybe, some people didn’t turn up after buying the tickets!

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke on Wednesday about Kashmir and actions taken by the Union government, including the removal of Article 370 , economic measures, and elections with high voter turnout. He also discussed Brics countries' views on the use of the dollar in the international economy.He made these remarks during a session titled ""India’s Rise and Role in the World"" at the Chatham House think tank in London.When asked about Kashmir, Jaishankar said, ""In Kashmir, we have done a good job solving most of it. I think removing Article 370 was one step. Then, restoring growth, economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two. Holding elections, which were done with a very high turnout, was step number three. I think the part we are waiting for is the return of the stolen part of Kashmir, which is on the illegal Pakistani occupation. When that's done, I assure you, Kashmir solved.""Jaishankar also said that the US administration under President Donald Trump is moving towards multipolarity, which aligns with India's interests. He said that both countries have agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement .""We see a president and an administration which, in our parlance, is moving towards multipolarity and that is something that suits India,"" he said.Referring to the Quad alliance of the US, India, Australia, and Japan, he said, ""From President Trump’s perspective, the one big shared enterprise that we have is the Quad, which is an understanding where everybody pays their fair share… There are no free riders involved. So that’s a good model which works.""Regarding tariffs, Jaishankar said that commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington for discussions on a bilateral trade pact following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump at the White House last month.""We had a very open conversation about it (tariffs) and the result of that conversation was that we agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement,"" he said.Jaishankar also addressed topics such as India’s relationship with China, the internationalisation of the Rupee, and the role of the dollar in the global economy.On China, he noted some developments since October 2024, including the opening of the Mount Kailash pilgrimage route in Tibet.""We have a very, very unique relationship with China as the only two billion plus populated countries in the world… we want a relationship where our interests are respected, sensitivities are recognised and works for both of us,"" he said.Jaishankar is on an official visit to the United Kingdom and Ireland from March 4 to 9 to strengthen India's ties with both countries.","Jaishankar said that the US administration under President Donald Trump is moving towards multipolarity, which aligns with India's interests.

Then I thought, how can such a person become the Prime Minister of the country?” he added.Meanwhile, reacting to the remarks, Congress termed Aiyar as a frustrated individual and claimed that Rajiv Gandhi gave the country a modern outlook""I don't want to comment on someone who is frustrated individual.

I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday sought assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta in resolving the grievance of Indian Forest Service officers against their performance appraisal reports (PARs) being written by IAS officers as per the last June office order issued by Madhya Pradesh government.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran was dealing with a petition filed by Gaurav Bansal who has challenged the state's new mechanism for PAR of IFS officers that changed the PAR authority from divisional forest officers (DFOs) to Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF). IFS officers are objecting to their PARs being written by non-forest officers. Justice Gavai said IAS officers tend to boss over IFS officers and there is always a tussle between these two cadres. The IFS officers feel that the IAS officers do not know the intricacies of the forest conservation and wildlife protection steps taken by them and hence their performance appraisal by the IAS officers is bound to be error prone.""It should be resolved,"" the bench said. Mehta said he will deliberate on the issue and discuss with the stakeholders but hinted that the administrative hierarchy is well established and who would write which officer's PAR is provided for.The SC had earlier taken exception to the June 29, 2024, office order and warned that if it is not withdrawn then it may initiate contempt proceedings for issuance of the order in violation of the SC's orders.MP IFS Association had written a protest letter to CM Mohan Yadav highlighting the critical role played by forest service officials in wildlife and forest conservation and argued that the new PAR mechanism would demoralise these officers.The IAS officers supported the new mechanism saying four other biodiversity rich states - Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Rajasthan - have already implemented similar rules.",Supreme Court seeks assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta in resolving grievance of Indian Forest Service officers.

NEW DELHI: A UP constable who was recently show-caused for being late in a morning meeting blamed his wife as he said he can't sleep at night as his wife comes in his nightmare.

Our goal is to defeat DMK.""Known for his 'barefoot penance"" protest against DMK rule and past criticisms of AIADMK icons, Annamalai has softened his stance toward the latter.

BENGALURU: Karnataka government is set to reintroduce a proposal granting 4% quota for Muslim contractors in public civil works, nearly a year after dropping the idea amid controversy and allegations of appeasement politics.The move is seen as an effort by CM Siddaramaiah to consolidate support among Ahinda (a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, & Dalits) - a Congress vote base.The government is planning to amend Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements Act , 1999, in the assembly's current budget session to bring in the reservation. The finance department has prepared a blueprint, and law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil has reportedly given approval to the amendment.Karnataka reserves 24% of civil work contracts for SCs and STs, 4% for OBC category-1, and 15% for OBCs in category-2A. These reservations collectively account for 43% of the total contracts.If the proposed 4% Muslim quota is implemented under category-2B, overall reservation in govt contracts will increase to 47%, with ceiling being doubled to Rs 2 crore.During his first tenure as CM (2013-18), Siddaramaiah introduced reservation in govt contracts for SC/ST contractors. Earlier this year, two OBC categories were granted similar benefits. Communities like Besta, Uppara, and Dalit Christians fall under category-1, while Kurubas, Idigas, and over 100 other communities are part of category-2A. Siddaramaiah belongs to Kuruba community.Karnataka govt's push to expand reservations in public contracts has irked contractors from Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities, who do not receive such benefits.BJP has strongly opposed the move, calling it ""unconstitutional"" and an example of ""appeasement politics"". ""We oppose Congress govt's policy of dividing society based on religion,"" BJP state chief BY Vijayendra said. ""Congress sees only Muslims as minorities, ignoring other genuinely marginalised communities. Muslims already have reservations in education and employment, which goes against the Constitution.

""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars."" But what of the deeper scars - the ones left behind?","Shahzadi Khan was convicted of murdering a four-month-old child in Abu Dhabi.

NEW DELHI: Another petition has been filed in Supreme Court challenging the validity of Places of Worship Act , alleging that the law is unconstitutional as it not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary to adjudicate controversy over many disputed religious structures .Challenging validity of Section 4 of the Act which bars jurisdiction of court on declaration of the religious character of Places of Worship Act, the petition said it prevented judicial review which is one of the fundamental aspects of the Constitution and the prohibition undermines the authority of judiciary.""This provision not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary.

In his meeting with Starmer, Jaishankar had discussed taking forward bilateral, economic ties and enhancing people to people exchanges.Starmer also shared the UK's perspective on the Ukraine conflict in the meeting. The UK PM this week proposed a four-step plan that included development of a ""coalition of the willing"" in Europe to guarantee peace for Ukraine. He also committed to ""boots on the ground, and planes in the air"", saying Europe must do the heavy lifting. India, however, has continued to maintain that enduring peace is possible only through dialogue and diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine.For India, Bangladesh continues to pose a big challenge because of increasing radicalisation and the threat to regional stability.

Dallewal completes 100 days of fast:

BATHINDA/CHANDIGARH: Punjab farmers' march to Chandigarh following Samyukt Kisan Morcha 's (SKM) call for a week-long protest from March 5 was headed off at multiple points by police, largely restricting the protesters to their districts.The farmers, who moved towards Chandigarh on tractor-trolleys and other vehicles on Wednesday, were stopped on various highways.Chandigarh police, too, put up barricades at Chandigarh-Mohali border points to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the city. Security was also increased at these points, with police personnel checking vehicles, especially buses.Many farmer union representatives, including Joginder Singh Ugrahan, were detained and later released. SKM strongly condemned AAP govt headed by Bhagwant Mann for detaining octogenarian union representatives, including Ugrahan, Balbir Singh Rajewal and Ruldu Singh Mansa, and demanded an apology.SKM said thousands of farmers started protests on roads at more than 35 centres, as they were prevented by police from going to Chandigarh. They claimed more than 15,000 farmers had joined the protests across the state, despite the arrest and detention of nearly 350 farm activists the previous day.Countering Punjab CM Mann's remarks blaming farmer associations for making Punjab a ""state of dharnas"", SKM said farmers did not block road or rail traffic. The traffic blockades in Chandigarh and across the state were not because of the farmers' struggle, but the unwarranted restrictions imposed by Punjab Police and administration, SKM said. Kisan Mazdoor Morcha burnt Punjab chief minister's effigies in Amritsar to protest the police action.SKM (Non-Political) representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Wednesday completed 100 days of his fast unto death in support of farmers' demands , especially with regard to MSP. In a statement to mark the day, Dallewal reiterated his resolve to continue his agitation and urged central govt to accept farmers' demands. Mostly confined to his makeshift chamber on Khanauri-Data Singh Wala border of Punjab and Haryana during these three months, Dallewal had participated in talks with Union ministers on Feb 14 and 22. Over the past few days, Dallewal has not come out of the chamber as his blood pressure has been fluctuating. His fast has also affected the functioning of his kidneys.","Punjab farmers' march to Chandigarh headed off at multiple points by police.

At the same time, Justice Ghosh repeatedly flagged concerns on a possible ""intelligence lapse"" which allowed a mob to get close to a ""constitutional authority"" (the education minister) and even ""manhandle"" him.Basu, who went to JU on Saturday to attend a meeting of the West Bengal College and University Professors' Association, was heckled by Left-backed students over pending student union elections. His car was damaged, the meeting venue vandalized, several professors thrashed, and an employees' union office set on fire. Justice Ghosh said while there could be an agitation, it did not justify getting physically close to a constitutional authority, adding ""this is not the way civil society works"". ""I do not want a parallel to what is happening in the neighbouring country,"" he said.","Calcutta high court orders Bengal govt to ""act like a guardian"" of the students.

CHENNAI: An all-party meeting led by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin unanimously passed a resolution Wednesday opposing population-based delimitation as a ""grave threat"" to India's federal structure and urged PM Narendra Modi to assure in Parliament that the 1971 census-based Lok Sabha seat allocation would be extended for another 30 years beyond 2026.The meeting, held at the state secretariat, saw participation from representatives of 59 EC-registered parties, with the exception of six parties, including BJP, NTK, and TMC, which boycotted discussions.The 84th Amendment had frozen existing LS seats until 2026. With the deadline fast approaching, concerns have grown that population-based delimitation could disproportionately impact Tamil Nadu and other southern states.""Tamil Nadu is not against delimitation, but delimitation shouldn't penalise states for successful implementation of the socio-economic welfare programmes over the past five decades,"" the resolution states. The meeting resolved to form a joint action committee to take up the issue.""If the current 543 LS seats remain, Tamil Nadu could lose eight seats, reducing our representation from 39 to 31. If Lok Sabha expands to 848 seats, we might gain 22 seats, but if population is the sole criterion, we will only gain 10 - meaning a loss of 12 seats,"" Stalin said.The DMK-led Tamil Nadu govt had passed a resolution against delimitation in February last and AIADMK, PMK, and several others backed its stand.","An all-party meeting led by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin unanimously passed a resolution.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra assembly Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution suspending Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Asim Azmi for the duration of the budget session for his remarks eulogising Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. The comments were made in the context of the release of the film Chhava, which depicts the conflict between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb.Responding to his suspension, Azmi said, ""I was not given an opportunity to present my side. I have only said the same thing that professors and academics have said about Aurangzeb. I have never said anything against the state's icons.""The issue echoed in UP with CM Yogi Adityanath saying, "" SP should remove him. Do they support his views?"" In the legislative council, Yogi asked SP to bring Azmi to UP and said ""UP knows well how to take care of such people.""Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav defended Azmi, saying, ""If some people think suspension can put a rein on the truth, then this is the childishness of their negative thinking.""In the legislative council, when Fadnavis was asked by LoP Ambadas Danve of Shiv Sena (UBT) why Azmi was not jailed for his remarks, he said the MLA from Mankhurd-Shivajinagar will be ""100 per cent"" put in jail.In the assembly, the resolution for Azmi's suspension was moved by state minister Chandrakant Patil, a day after the issue rocked both houses.legislature.""Azmi's statements, which were made within the premises of legislature, are divisive and an insult to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. They have maligned the institution of the assembly,"" said Patil.

""In 2017, when a legislator made derogatory remarks about soldiers at the border, he faced more stringent punishment. Chhatrapati Shivaji and Sambhaji Maharaj are like gods for us. Why is Azmi being suspended only for one session,"" questioned Mungantiwar.Patil clarified that in the case of the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs by MVA govt, SC had ruled that the suspension could not proceed beyond one assembly session.While Congress's Vijay Wadettiwar supported Azmi's suspension, he asked for action against other leaders who had insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji and Sambhaji Maharaj like Prashant Koratkar, actor Rahul Solapurkar and former governor B S Koshyari. This resulted in an outcry and sloganeering from governing party MLAs in the house.The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi staged protests on the steps of Vidhan Bhavan Wednesday seeking action against Prashant Koratkar, Koshyari and Rahul Solapurkar over their alleged comments insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray called for the permanent suspension of Azmi from the assembly: "" It should not just be for the budget session, the suspension should be permanent.""On Akhilesh Yadav's tweets on Azmi's suspension, Uddhav said, ""Let him object if he wants to.

‘Basic safeguards ignored’: Hathras panel on stampede

HATHRAS: A judicial commission investigating the deadly stampede at a 'satsang' in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, in which 121 people died on July 2 last year, has placed the blame squarely on "" administrative lapses "" while acknowledging the possibility of a larger conspiracy. The report did not hold Bhole Baba aka Narayan Saakar Hari personally responsible for the incident and instead pointed to administrative failures and his 'sevadars' as key factors contributing to the tragedy.In its 1,680-page report, tabled in the UP assembly on Wednesday, the panel said while permission had been granted for an audience of 80,000, the turnout swelled to 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh. It said the administration did not make any effort to check the arrangements.Led by retired Allahabad HC judge Brijesh Kumar Srivastava, along with retired IAS officer Hemant Rao and former IPS officer Bhavesh Kumar Singh, the commission said “basic safeguards had been ignored”. In response to the findings, the commission has put forward more than 20 recommendations aimed at preventing such disasters in the future. The report pointed out that there had been no proper route plan for the arrival and departure of self-styled preacher Bhole Baba, a factor that added to the disorder. It added that fire safety protocols and emergency measures, conditions required for event approval, had never been implemented, nor had the administration made any effort to verify these arrangements.It said the situation became even more precarious as Bhole Baba’s ‘sevadars’ took charge of crowd control rather than law enforcement agencies, preventing police from overseeing the gathering. This, the commission noted, raised the possibility of a conspiracy. “No prior information regarding individuals posted as sevadars, commanders etc was shared with police, hence their verification remained incomplete. Such individuals could potentially be involved in a conspiracy to discredit govt, amplify the event, or exploit the situation,” the report said.The commission added that although preparations for the event had begun nearly 10 days in advance, with devotees arriving in phases, there had been no inspection by officials from police, administration, fire department, PWD, UP Roadways, or any other relevant agency. The lack of oversight and coordination, the panel concluded, significantly contributed to the tragedy. Following the report’s release, Bhole Baba’s advocate A P Singh “welcomed” its conclusions, asserting it had cleared his client of any wrongdoing. “The judicial commission constituted by CM Adityanath has given a clean chit to my client. The report also exposed the conspirators who made allegations against my client,” he said.","A judicial commission investigating the deadly stampede at a'satsang' in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, in which 121 people died on July 2 last year, has placed the blame squarely on 'administrative lapses' The report did not hold Bhole Baba aka Narayan Saakar Hari personally responsible for the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118743477,imgsize-1288841,width-400,resizemode-4/118743477.jpg"

"‘Bharat will maintain its freedom of choice’: Jaishankar takes swipe at US, China; calls out 'trade hypocrisy'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-will-maintain-its-freedom-of-choice-jaishankar-takes-swipe-at-us-china-calls-out-trade-hypocrisy/articleshow/124190354.cms,"S Jaishankar addressing UNGA (PTI)

NEW DELHI: In a veiled but pointed critique of both the United States and China, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday flagged growing trade protectionism, tariff unpredictability, and coercive supply chain practices by major global powers.Addressing the 80th session of the united nations general assembly (UNGA), he cautioned that such actions were eroding trust in the international system and disproportionately hurting the Global South.While not naming countries directly, Jaishankar’s remarks appeared to take aim at recent moves by Washington and Beijing, calling out what he described as ""trade hypocrisy"" and selective responses to global crises.“We now see tariff volatility and uncertain market access as a result. De-risking is a growing compulsion, whether from limited sources of supply, or over dependence on a particular market,” he said, stressing that Bharat “will always maintain its freedom of choice.”The statement comes as US President Donald Trump earlier this week announced a 100 per cent import tariff on branded and patented pharmaceutical products, unless companies relocate manufacturing to the US.“I’m putting a 100 per cent import tax on pharmaceutical drugs unless the companies are building plants right here in the United States,” Trump declared on his social media platform, Truth Social.India has also been facing steep tariffs from the US over its continued imports of Russian oil, with Trump already imposing a 50 per cent duty on Indian exports. Talks between Indian and American trade negotiators in New York earlier this week failed to resolve the deadlock. Indian officials reiterated the country’s need for affordable energy, noting past disruptions due to US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.Without directly naming China, Jaishankar highlighted risks arising from overconcentration of critical mineral supply chains. “Heightened technology control” and a “grip on supply chains and critical minerals” are compounding existing economic challenges, he noted.He also criticised the conduct of wealthier nations during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Better-off societies insulated themselves by having the first call, as the resource-pressed ones scrambled to survive, only to hear sanctimonious lectures thereafter,” he said.Reaffirming India’s role on the global stage, Jaishankar said, “As the most populous nation, as a civilisational state, as a rapidly growing major economy, we are confident about who we are, and what we will be. Bharat will always maintain its freedom of choice. And will always be a voice of the Global South.”His address came a day after a BRICS foreign ministers’ meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA, where member states issued a joint statement warning against the proliferation of trade-restrictive measures. They expressed concern that such practices could fragment global trade and further marginalise developing nations.The US has repeatedly accused BRICS of promoting anti-American policies, particularly in advocating trade in local currencies. Trump has threatened punitive tariffs of up to 100 per cent on member countries including China, Brazil, and South Africa.In his closing message, Jaishankar urged the global south to resist pressures from protectionist trends and stand for equitable and sustainable multilateralism.","S Jaishankar flagged growing trade protectionism, tariff unpredictability, and coercive supply chain practices by major global powers.

Why India's Oscar entry matters in the age of amnesia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-oscar-entry-matters-in-the-age-of-amnesia/articleshow/124189613.cms,"The premiere of Neeraj Ghaywan 's 'Homebound' felt like being inside an Instagram scroll. The film had just been selected as India's national submission to the Academy Awards. After its shiny world premiere at Cannes, it was being screened for guests in Juhu. People had turned out. It was hard to keep your eyes from resting too long on all of the very familiar, very-online faces.Two hours later, that feeling had changed into something like its reverse. The opposite of the content scroll - the ever-advancing feed of new information and images - is the act of pausing to remember.There are plenty of reasons 'Homebound' is so interesting. Many of them I'd known in advance: its origins in a news photo from 2020, and a later piece of reportage about that photo; that it came to be produced by Karan Johar, the poster-boy of louche Bollywood glamour and big-city liberalism, who put a cast of dewy young stars to work at portraying the hard lives of working-class India. That it somehow squeezed through the Censor Board, with only some forced cuts, to become India's official entry to the Oscars.The film is affecting, though, not because of its blockbuster treatment, but because it simply remembers - and lets us remember - in a way that feels increasingly rare. Its story first appeared in the form of a news photograph in May of 2020, in the middle of India's first pandemic lockdown. By the side of the highway, a man cradles his friend's head in his lap.The friend is sick, lying unconscious on the bare ground, and the young man is visibly bewildered. The two men, both in their early twenties, were Mohammad Saiyub and Amrit Kumar, one a Muslim and the other a Dalit Hindu.The image of their tender, stricken situation went viral. It was an intimate view of what many of us were watching from an emotional distance; the huge, forced exodus of working-class Indians out of cities, where their workplaces had been shuttered, onto the highways to try and find a way home. It drove home the private crises taking place within the masses of people on the move. It was also a rebuke to the script of Hindu-Muslim conflict that ran on endless repeat in the Indian media (which had already tried to report the pandemic's outbreak as a conspiracy: ""Corona Jihad"").Those bewildering early weeks of Covid, and the mass-exodus of Indians from urban centers, seemed like events we would never forget. Many events inthose years felt that way. Among privileged Indians, though, the memory of lockdown has dwindled into hazy, private reminiscences: about sleeping in late, and listening to podcasts while you swept your own floors.Covid as a national event - a collective crisis we all witnessed or experienced in one way or another - seems suppressed from collective memory. In March and April of 2022, for instance, we had experienced a near-unravelling of society during the second wave: people falling sick, with no route left to a hospital bed or any medical care. For a period, there was no way to meet a specialist, no way to fill a prescription, no oxygen to bring home; there were only dozens of hopeless phone numbers and registries. It was a traumatic event on a national scale.Yet this summer, the five-year anniversary of the first lockdown passed by us in eerie silence, without remark or remembrance. 'Homebound', arriving now, at the end of monsoon, is like a rush of oxygen to the brain. The act of remembering feels like an exceptional - in the sense of rare - phenomenon in our present lives. The twin engines of social media and 24x7 news drive our attention continuously to the present and the new. Breaking news used to reach us once or twice a day, in the morning paper or evening broadcast; now it arrives every minute of the day.As an asset to a democratic society, breaking news is highly overrated. It serves very little purpose to have news and information come at us without pause; without time to understand it, or even to properly feel anything about it. What is underrated is the opposite of breaking news: memory. But it's so hard to sustain a thought nowadays. How do we sustain our interest in what mattered to us five years, five hours ago or even five minutes ago? We're too busy being informed about everything to care about anything.Technology and media manufacture amnesia about even the largest, most destabilising events we've lived through together. They suppress collective memory, as if by design. Instead, we argue viciously about history and the ancient past. The political crises of 500 years ago are dragged into our view again and again, while the crises of five years disappear. The courage to reverse that is radical, even when it's hidden behind the bright lights of a big premiere.Karnad is an award-winning author","Neeraj Ghaywan's 'Homebound' was selected as India's national submission to the Academy Awards.

Did basmati kill basmati?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-basmati-kill-basmati/articleshow/124189584.cms,"It has been described as the 'best rice in the world' by Taste Atlas, more evocatively as 'karza faad' (debt-breaker) by farmers, and even found a place in the tragic love story of Heer Ranjha written by famous Punjabi poet Waris Shah in the 18th century. Today, this aromatic variety is used to whip up everything from biryanis and kheers to foreign dishes like sushi. It has also sparked a cross-border row, with Pakistan looking to benefit from the 50% duty imposed by the Trump administration on Indian exports.Yet, a less-known fact about the much-feted basmati rice is that it is also a silent killer. The victim: traditional varieties of basmati and non-basmati rice that were once grown and consumed across India but have now nearly vanished from farms and dining tables.Agrarian scientist Debal Deb, who has been working on rice seed conservation for the last two decades, estimates that 60-80% of the rice bought off the shelf is not the variety claimed on the packet. ""The biggest challenge today is that farmers use cross-pollination and don't maintain genetic purity,"" says the Odisha-bases researcher.But before villainising the hybrids, it's important to understand the context in which they came about.India's desperate need for self-sufficiency in food grains led to agricultural research scientists creating sturdier grains of rice like the Pusa Basmati (PB) 1121 and PB 1509 over the years. These varieties could cope with the constant onslaught of pests and diseases such as bacterial blight and responded well to chemical fertilisers. This not only fed more mouths, it also meant that farmers, even those with small landholdings, gained from higher yield and fewer losses. Soon, large swathes of land in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh shifted to these hybrid varieties. This shift helped India become the largest producer of basmati rice, supplying 65% of global demand, with Pakistan accounting for most of the rest.However, this has come at a cost of traditional varieties. Across India, rice seed varieties have come down from 1,00,000 in the 1970s to less than 6,000 - a loss of 93%.Traditional strains such as Veliyan rice in Kerala, which is drought-resistant, or Jengoni in Assam, known for its medicinal qualities, are rarely cultivated.Umendra Dutt, founder of the Kheti Virasat Mission that works in conserving indigenous seeds and traditional methods of cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, says that the region had lost all its paddy varieties. ""When we started the mission in 2005, we had to get seeds from other parts of the country to bring traditional varieties back to our farms,"" he says. Over the past two decades, Punjab's Malwa region, where this initiative is based, has seen a surge of cancer cases that studies have linked to excessive and inappropriate use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers.""It was only after we found out how much damage had been done that we encouraged farmers to adopt organic methods and switch to traditional crops,"" Dutt says. The Mission conserves and distributes 10-12 varieties of rice.Deb, also called the Seed Warrior, says while not all the loss is directly due to basmati, the dominance of basmati in its traditional growing regions has accelerated the decline of other varieties. ""Farmers behave like businessmen who are seeking profits. They have no interest in conserving,"" he says.At Basudha, a 1.7-acre farm in Odisha's Rayagada district, Deb has been working towards conservation of 1,492 rice landraces (traditional strains) collected from farmers in India and abroad, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, Korea, Italy and the US. Beyond seed preservation, he has built awareness around genetic purity and the importance of crop diversity. The Vrihi Seed Exchange Network he started now connects over 8,000 farmers in 12 states who cultivate and exchange seeds among themselves. Vrihi also documents varieties rich in vitamin B complex, essential omega-3 fatty acids and those that can withstand drought, flood, salinity, or resist pests and diseases.In Assam's Jorhat, Mahan Chandra Borah, who has been working on saving seeds for the last two decades, criticises the profit-driven approach. ""This monoculture is destroying our living heritage. Conserving these seeds is necessary for sustainable food security in the future,"" he says. Borah recalls how his village, Meleng Kathgaon, would cultivate 10-12 varieties of rice when he was a child. ""The next village grew other varieties which were different from ours and we would exchange seeds. But now the landraces are down to a handful,"" he says. He conserves over 500 varieties through the Annapurna Seed Library.He highlights the benefits of conservation: farmers growing traditional varieties regain control over food production and reduce dependence on costly commercial seeds. Yet, he warns that the impact of individual farmers is limited. ""There is no govt initiative for conservation. All govt-run research institutes are focused on genetic engineering,"" he says.","India is the largest producer of basmati rice, supplying 65% of global demand. But this has come at a cost of traditional varieties. Across India, rice seed varieties have come down from 1,00,000 in the 1970s to less than 6,000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124189594,imgsize-766999,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Russian FM Lavrov Hails Stronger India-Russia Ties, Putin’s Visit To India Confirmed By Year-End

At the recent 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that plans are underway for President Putin to visit New Delhi in December.As per news agency ANI, he remarked, “In December, a visit from Mr Putin is being planned to New Delhi,” highlighting the significant bilateral agenda that includes trade, military cooperation, technological exchange, finance, humanitarian efforts, healthcare, and advancements in high-tech sectors such as artificial intelligence.Lavrov also expressed confidence in India’s ability to independently navigate its trade relations, stating, “India is perfectly capable of making their own decisions in its trade relations with Russia.”Reflecting on recent discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, he added, “This year, my colleague, I spoke to him yesterday, will visit Russia, and I will visit India. We hold regular exchanges.”He also praised Jaishankar's diplomatic stance, which asserts India’s autonomy in deciding its energy partnerships.In regard to the US imposing sanctions on India for purchasing Russian oil, Lavrov firmly stated that the economic partnership between India and Russia is “not under threat,” reaffirming that India selects its own international partners.As per ANI, he noted, “If the US has proposals on how to enrich bilateral trade between the US and India, they are prepared to discuss the terms for that.”He also pointed out that India’s relationships with third states are matters to be decided independently, reflecting a broader sentiment of national pride.Moreover, Lavrov underscored the longstanding strategic partnership between India and Russia, which has been further upgraded to a “particularly privileged strategic partnership.”He stressed that the relationship extends beyond the influence of US-India dynamics and highlighted recent high-level meetings, including the recent gathering of Prime Minister Modi and President Putin at the SCO summit in China.Lavrov also reiterated Russia’s endorsement of India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ).According to ANI, he stated, “Russia supports the application of Brazil and India for permanent seats” on the Council, emphasising the need for reform to reflect the current global landscape. Lavrov’s remarks come as Mauritius and Bhutan have also voiced their support for India's UNSC aspirations, aligning with the growing demand for a more representative Council.He pointed out the differences that have emerged in the global balance since the UN's formation 80 years ago, advocating for adjustments that will make the UNSC more effective and inclusive. This sentiment is echoed in discussions around the need for collective representation from regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America in international forums.These developments coincide with a broader call for UNSC reform, as outlined in joint statements from BRICS meetings that seek to create a Council that is “more democratic, representative, effective and efficient,” reflecting the voices of developing nations.","Russian FM Lavrov Hails Stronger India-Russia Ties, Putin’s Visit To India Confirmed By Year-End.

QRSAM offers 360° radar, jamming shield, mobile launchers

Poll Which aspect of the QRSAM systems do you find most impressive? Mobility and 360° radar coverage Integration with AI systems

NEW DELHI: India kicked off the acquisition process for three highly mobile regiments of indigenous quick reaction surface-to-air missile (QRSAM) systems that can detect and destroy aircraft, attack helicopters, drones, rockets and missiles at ranges of over 30km, at a cost of about Rs 30,000 crore.The Army this week issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named “Anant Shastra”, which has been developed by DRDO and will be co-produced by defence PSUs Bharat Electronics and Bharat Dynamics.The move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor. The Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such QRSAM regiments in the long term, each with nine firing units, while the IAF at present is looking to induct three QRSAM squadrons, as was first reported by TOI.With missile launchers, 360-degree radars, automated command and control systems and all-weather tracking systems mounted on high-mobility 8x8 vehicles, the QRSAM systems are designed to provide air defence cover to tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns.""With their 'search, track and fire at short halt' capabilities, the QRSAM systems will be able to operate on the move with mechanised columns across plains, deserts and mountains both on the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) fronts.They will give protection not only against enemy aircraft but also new-age threats like swarm drones and loitering munitions,"" an officer said.The QRSAM systems, with a 30-km interception range to neutralise incoming threats at altitudes of 6 to 10km, are also designed to resist electronic jamming to ensure accuracy even under hostile conditions.""With pre-fragmented warheads, high-speed solid fuel propulsion and network integration with the Army's Akashteer command & control network, the Anant Shastra will be a tactical game-changer. It will replace old systems such as the Russian-origin OSA-AK to give the Army a faster, smarter and more mobile shield,"" another officer said.Once inducted, the QRSAM systems will add to the country's existing multi-layered air defence network of foreign and indigenous systems, which played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the conflict.In addition to its existing Akash surface-to-air missiles, which have a 25-km interception range, the AAD is also inducting two new Akash Prime regiments designed for air defence in high-altitude areas above 4,500-metre along the frontier with China under a Rs 8,160 crore contract in March 2023.The AAD, which currently has 55 regiments of different weapon systems, is also going in for “smart and programmable ammunition” for its old L-70 anti-aircraft guns and ZU-23mm twin-barrel cannons, which incidentally performed well during Operation Sindoor.“Parallelly, quickly-deployable counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) guns, with a high rate of fire, as well as successors to L-70 and ZU-23 guns will be required. Counter-RAM (rocket, artillery and mortar) capability similar to the Phalanx close-in weapon systems of the US will also be needed,” a third officer said.The AAD will also have to go in for a major upgrade in its radars and sensors guiding the air defence guns. At present, they are geared to detect larger targets like aircraft instead of smaller ones like drones.","The Army this week issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named ‘Anant Shastra’ The move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor.

India secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Sri Lanka in their final Super Four match of the Asia Cup in Dubai on Wednesday, with Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav praising his team's character and particularly highlighting the performances of middle-order batsmen Sanju Samson , Tilak Varma, and bowler Arshdeep Singh 's composure in the decisive Super Over where Sri Lanka managed only two runs.The match, despite being a dead rubber, turned into an intense contest with both teams scoring over 200 runs, including a century from Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka.""It felt like a final and the boys showed a lot of character after the first half in the second innings. I told the boys to have good energy and let's see where we are at the end. To have that start with the bat, and someone like Sanju and Tilak taking that tempo was good to see. And for someone like Sanju, who is not opening the batting, and taking that responsibility and even Tilak showing great confidence, which was good to see,"" said Suryakumar during the post-match presentation.""Arshdeep has delivered for us the last 2-3 years.

CHENNAI: Chaotic images from a political rally in Karur, Tamil Nadu, show massive crowds packed along the 2 km stretch from the Karur-Trichy highway roundabout to the Karur-Erode highway on Saturday evening.Supporters and party workers surrounded actor-turned-politician Vijay’s campaign vehicle, with many women, children, and young girls among the attendees. Cadres stood dangerously close to the vehicle, according to the images.The gathering quickly turned chaotic, triggering panic and a stampede. Several attendees fainted and were rushed to nearby hospitals.At least 39 people, including 10 children and 17 women, were killed, while 81 were hospitalised, many with serious injuries.Witnesses said the stampede began shortly after Vijay started his speech, when disturbances in the crowd caused panic. The actor appealed to the crowd and police to remain calm before cutting his speech short and leaving the venue.Survivors described floodlights failing, parents searching for missing children, and people trapped under two-wheelers and barricades. Some even climbed rooftops to help others, but the structures collapsed, worsening the situation.In response to the tragedy, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin announced an inquiry commission, headed by retired judge Justice Aruna Jagatheesan, to investigate the incident.

Global consulting giant Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months. The company cited slowing corporate demand and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as primary drivers of the workforce reduction. While the restructuring, valued at $865 million, aims to align the company with evolving client needs, it also signals a broader shift in the skills white-collar professionals will need to remain relevant.Accenture Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet addressed analysts, explaining that the company is “exiting people on a compressed timeline where reskilling is not a viable path for the skills we need.” The statement underscores a growing reality in corporate environments: not all employees can be retrained fast enough to meet the demands of rapidly changing technology. Sweet emphasized that the company will prioritize workforce alignment with client demand for AI-driven solutions, a move that may result in further exits in the months ahead.At the end of August 2025, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The layoffs , part of a continuing process expected to run until November 2025, reflect both operational restructuring and the financial imperative of managing severance costs.The company projects that the initiative will save over $1 billion, even as it seeks to retain core talent capable of delivering on AI-focused projects.Alongside workforce reductions, Accenture is investing in upskilling programs focused on agentic AI, a new class of tools designed to automate complex decision-making and operational tasks. Sweet noted that these programs are essential for meeting client expectations as businesses globally seek to reinvent operations with AI. For white-collar professionals, the implication is clear: developing proficiency in emerging AI technologies is no longer optional but increasingly central to career sustainability.While the Accenture layoffs are significant, they offer critical lessons for professionals navigating a transforming work environment:Accenture’s approach demonstrates a broader trend: the integration of AI into corporate strategy is reshaping not only business models but also the expectations placed on white-collar professionals. Those who embrace continuous learning, anticipate technological shifts, and develop highly relevant skills will find themselves better positioned in a rapidly evolving job market.The Accenture story serves as a reminder that career growth is increasingly tied to adaptability, specialized expertise, and proactive planning. For white-collar professionals, the lesson is unambiguous: the future belongs to those who prepare for it, not those who wait for it.","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Indians in Canada







Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country will soon announce some proposals to take in foreign workers for whom the American dream is now too costly because of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. ""Not as many H1B visa holders will get visas in the US. These people are skilled, and this is an opportunity for Canada... We will soon bring a proposal on this,"" Carney said, adding that these people are enterprising and willing to move for work.In a major overhaul of the employment-based visa system, the Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas which will make it difficult for companies to hire foreign workers, as tech companies will now have to pay this fee if they want to hire foreign workers. The move is aimed at saving jobs for Americans, while it will hurt foreign workers from India and China.Several countries, including Germany and the UK, have seized the opportunity and reached out to Indian talent.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is said to have started exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for top global talent even before Trump's major H-1B move. Starmer has a global talent task force that has been developing ideas to draw the world's best scientists, academics and digital experts to Britain.One option being weighed is a zero-fee system for applicants who have studied at the world’s top five universities or won prestigious prizes.German Ambassador to India, Dr Philipp Ackermann, recently made an open call to highly skilled Indians to work in Germany. ""The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.Indians are already Canada's top source of immigrants, as figures reveal that out of 32,000 tech workers who migrated to Canada from April 2022 to March 2023, around 15,000 were Indian. In 2024, about 87,000 Indians obtained Canadian citizenship, making them the largest group among new Canadian citizens.In 2022, about 118,095 Indians became permanent residents in Canada. That was about 27-30% of all new permanent residents.","Canada PM Mark Carney says his country will take foreign workers as US hikes H-1B visa fee.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion. If the organising committee of this Durga Puja pandal is so interested in secularism, I would ask them to display a photograph of a Hindu God or Goddess at any event organised by the Church or at Madrasas in Ranchi.

India has confronted this challenge since its Independence. Having a neighbour that is an epicentre of global terrorism. ""At the UN, he also recalled the Pahalgam incident, where 26 tourists lost their lives, and said that is the recent example of cross border barbarism.""For decades now, major international terrorist attacks are traced back to that one country. The US-designated list of terrorists is replete with these nationals. The most recent example of cross border barbarism was the murder of innocent tourist in Pehalgam in April this year,"" he added.The April 22 assault in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot in Pahalgam often called ""mini Switzerland"", marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since Pulwama in 2019.The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the massacre.Talking about the Operation Sindoor, Jaishankar said that India exercised its right to defend its people against terrorism and brought its organisers and perpetrators to justice.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, 2024, targeting terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and PoK, following the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Indian forces hit nine key terror camps and support facilities, stretching from Muridke to Bahawalpur, long known as hubs for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The operation was mainly carried out by the Indian Air Force, backed by loitering munitions and ground-based artillery.He asked the UN to create a pressure on the entire terrorism ecosystem and the financing of terrorism must be choked.""When nations openly declare terrorism a state policy, when terror hubs operate on an industrial scale, when terrorists are publicly glorified, then such actions must be unequivocally condemned. The financing of terrorism must be choked even as prominent terrorists are sanctioned. Relentless pressure must be applied on the entire terrorism ecosystem.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta High Court struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.

Ladakh Violence: Sonam Wangchuk Ends 15-Day Hunger Strike

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA . The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOL’s FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation “untenable.”Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an “inadvertent” error.Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved “study on sovereignty of the country,” which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.""We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,"" association replied.The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.""AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,"" the statement read.""NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association ""Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,"" the statement added.The CBI 's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).""To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,"" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone.The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety.""I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,"" he said, adding, ""I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.""Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, ""In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.""""A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,"" he added.The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.","The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh.

Poll Should there be a review system for deportations involving elderly individuals? Yes, to ensure fairness and safety No, existing rules are enough





CHANDIGARH: A 73-year-old grandma, who lived in US for 30 years, ""did everything right, worked, paid tax, and never missed any immigration check date"" is heartbroken after being deported in cruel manner — denied access to even her medicines on flight and once handed a plate of ice as food during her detention.""After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live,"" Harjit Kaur said with anguish. Choking up while speaking to TOI on Thursday evening, she said: ""Look at my feet, they are swollen like cow dung cakes. I neither got medicine nor am I able to walk.""Kaur landed in New Delhi on Thursday afternoon and was on her way to her sister's house in Mohali when she narrated her ordeal to TOI. A native of Pangota village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago after her husband, Sukhwinder Singh, passed away.She lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked at a cloth store in Berkeley till Jan this year when she had to quit because of complications from her knee surgeries.Kaur was taken into custody on Sept 8 during a routine check-in with immigration officials.Her asylum applications had been turned down, with the last rejection in 2012.Kaur was moved to Mesa Verde IC Processing Centre in Bakersfield. ""Despite the outrage over my detention and sympathy for me, the authorities in the US were simply unmoved,"" she said.She was flown from Georgia to Armenia and then to New Delhi, along with 132 others, many of whom were Punjabis, she said. She was the only one not shackled and handcuffed. ""I was the oldest, you see,"" Kaur said.Her lawyer in the US, Deepak Ahluwalia, put out a video narrating the 60-70 hours before her deportation flight to India. ""She was not given a bed and had to share a holding room. There was a concrete bench. She was made to sleep on the floor with a blanket. She was unable to get up when she would lie down because she had double knee replacement surgery.""Ahluwalia added, ""She would ask for food so she could take her medicines. Those requests were ignored. Not that she wasn't fed at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. When she asked again to have something or even water to take her medication, she was given a plate of ice. She explained she had dentures and could not eat them. The guard told her — ‘that's your fault'.""Kaur was even denied a shower the entire time, said the lawyer. ""Prior to the flight on Monday around 7pm, she and other detainees were given wet wipes and told to just clean up before they boarded. Throughout this entire ordeal, no food,"" he said.Ahluwalia said an officer was apparently going to cuff and shackle Kaur as they ""usually do on the plane,"" but another officer said not to because of her age. ""The point I am trying to make here is how a 73-year-old grandmother with no criminal record was treated. And everyone can keep saying she had a final order of removal and she was asked to leave. ICE has suggested in their response to media articles that she had exhausted all her appeal options. That's correct. What's completely incorrect is that she chose to stay here when her case was denied or the last appeal option ran out.""Kaur is heartbroken that she could not even bid a proper farewell to her home in the US. ""I couldn't go back even once to take care of my belongings, which were lying the way I left them,"" she told TOI.Now back in India, she said she was ""unwell"" and would stay with her sister in Mohali for the time being. ""Let's see what is in store for my life,"" she said.Kaur has all sympathy for those who were deported with her. ""They spent lakhs to go there. Some of them had spent 10 months to a year in detention and now return empty-handed. They were in distress as they had sold their land to reach US,"" said the elderly woman.Kaur's younger brother, Kulwant Singh, a farmer in Pangota village, told TOI that he and the entire family would take care of her.""We were able to get a travel document by ourselves and were trying to negotiate with ICE attorneys and US govt for her to depart on a commercial flight. That's all we were asking for,"" Ahluwalia said.""We had asked to release her for even 24 hours. You can put ankle monitoring, or do whatever you need to, but give her a chance to say her goodbyes and take care of what she needs to take care of, and she will depart from San Francisco on Monday. We had attached the flight ticket, but they stopped responding. And around 2am on Saturday, without notifying the attorney or anyone else, they took her from Mesa Verde and drove her to LA in handcuffs,"" he added.Ahluwalia said that a separate complaint would be given on the way Kaur was treated during her deportation. Kaur said whatever her counsel said in the video was true.Kulwant Singh, the younger brother, said that Harjit was second among four siblings. Their eldest brother Jasbir Singh passed away. ""It's sad the way she has been deported. She has been separated from her family. Now, I and our other family members will take care of her in Punjab, "" said Singh.","Harjit Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago. She lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked at a cloth store in Berkeley. Kaur was taken into custody on Sept 8 during a routine check-in with immigration officials. Her asylum applications had been turned down, with the last rejection in 2012.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124137776,imgsize-25094,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

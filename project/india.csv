Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

NEW DELHI: In another revelation in the Raju Raghuvanshi murder case, the East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police, Vivek Syiem, has disclosed critical details about the murder of Raja Raghuvanshi, labelling Raj Kushwaha as the mastermind ans that it was a favour by the others involved and not contract killing.The case, which has gripped the region, has taken a new turn with the identification of the mastermind behind the heinous act.According to SP Syiem, Raj Kushwaha orchestrated the murder, with Sonam, Raja's wife, playing a pivotal role in the execution of the plan. ""The mastermind of this is Raj Kushwaha. Sonam played along with this plan,"" he said.The plot involved three individuals, including Raj's cousin, who were not hired assassins but rather friends doing a favor for Kushwaha. "" The three people involved are friend and one of them is Raj's cousin. It was not a contract killing. They did it as a favour for their friend,"" he added.Further talking about the planning behind the murder, he further said, ""Since February, when they were in Indore, they were planning on how Sonam would disappear... When Raja and Sonam got married, they came to Kamakhya Devi Temple. The other four people also came here a few days before.They planned to eliminate Raja in Guwahati. Sonam made the plan to come to Shillong.""On June 2, the body of Raja Raghuvanshi was recovered from a deep gorge near a waterfall in Sohra (Cherrapunji), East Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya. Raja and his wife, Sonam Raghuvanshi, had gone missing on May 23 while on their honeymoon in the state, after being married on May 11.Examination revealed that Raja sustained severe head injuries, and authorities later recovered a blood-stained sharp weapon from the scene.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026. It’s going to be even bigger, even better.”Also Read: “Sh*t on their shoes”: Erin Andrews disgusted and blasts ‘trashy’ women for public restroom selfies Despite planning a return to ESPN for the 2025-26 season, Sharpe’s future now hinges on the outcome of this high-stakes legal battle.","Gabriella Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000.

Trying to shake the regime







""The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday in a video statement after Israel struck over 200 military and nuclear sites in Iran.The unannounced strikes were clearly meant to disrupt Tehran's nuclear work and increase the time it would take for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.However, the number of sites hit, the specific nature of the targets, and remarks from Israeli leaders suggest there may be a wider aim: weakening or even removing Iran’s ruling regime.""As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Israeli strikes that hit targets across Iran, including nuclear sites, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists.The attacks early Friday went beyond nuclear plants and missile sites. They also targeted senior members of Iran’s military and nuclear experts — moves that, according to a Reuters report, seem designed to damage Iran’s image internally and among its partners in the region. These are actions that could affect the stability of Iran’s leadership.There is already significant dissatisfaction among many people in Iran due to economic struggles, lack of free expression, and ongoing issues related to women’s and minority rights.In this situation, Netanyahu may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic.Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern. From that view, Iran should be offered incentives: if it stops pursuing nuclear weapons and ends its support for armed groups, it could have sanctions removed and be reintegrated into the global system.Others believe the real issue is the continued existence of the Islamic Republic. They argue that Iran’s leadership is unlikely to change its regional behaviour and is working not to deter Israel, but to destroy it. From this perspective, diplomatic talks only help Iran buy time. A nuclear programme seen as illegal gives cover to maintain sanctions, which they hope will eventually weaken a regime they consider beyond repair.There is no common ground between these two positions. And now, more clearly than before, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in the second group. The recent strikes were not mainly focused on nuclear equipment but on top military commanders of the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime’s hold on power, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article in Foreign Policy.Israel might believe that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the Iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.This is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for. But this approach is risky.Even with the damage caused by Israel’s recent attack, there is long-standing hostility toward Israel — not just from Iran’s leadership but also from much of its mostly Shi’ite population. That makes it uncertain whether public anger alone could bring down a well-established religious government that has the support of strong security forces.There is no sign that such a series of events will even begin. And even if it does, there’s no clarity on what direction it would take, a BBC report said.Power in Iran lies mostly with those who control the military and the economy. Much of this power rests with hardliners in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected groups.These groups don’t need to carry out a coup — they already have authority. And they could choose to make Iran more confrontational in response to attacks.Another possible result could be the collapse of the current government, followed by instability in Iran.With a population of nearly 90 million, any unrest in Iran would affect many countries in the Middle East.If Israel is able to remove the Islamic leadership in Tehran, the attack would be seen as successful. But if the leadership stays in place — and history suggests that airstrikes alone rarely bring regime change — then Iran could still keep some part of its nuclear program, Jeffrey Lewis writes.Israel’s national security advisor has already said that Iran might still keep parts of its nuclear capability. So what happens then?One possibility Israel sees is that Iran could agree to a deal with US President Donald Trump to give up its nuclear plans. But another possibility is that Iran could follow North Korea’s path — leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and eventually developing nuclear weapons. In that case, it is unlikely that Russia or China would support new sanctions. They may not even enforce the ones already in place. Russia has been buying Iranian drones, and China imports Iranian oil.The reasons why Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stopped the country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 — and why he kept that policy — are not fully known. There have been different views within Iran: some have wanted a nuclear weapon, while others have not. Until now, those opposing the bomb have been able to influence policy. But after this recent strike, these discussions will likely change. There will also be new individuals involved in these decisions. People will think about those who are no longer there and ask whether Israel would have acted this way if Iran already had nuclear weapons — or if Israel didn’t have them.If the Iranian government doesn’t fall, Israel might feel the need to carry out more attacks in the future. Even if this strike has seriously disrupted Iran’s nuclear efforts, Iran could restart the program.""In the ideal world, Israel would prefer to see a change of regime, no question about that,"" Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.If Israel succeeds in removing Iran's leadership, there is no guarantee the successor that emerges would not be even more hardline in pursuit of conflict with Israel.""For years, many in Israel have insisted that regime change in Iran would prompt a new and better day - that nothing could be worse than the current theocratic regime,"" Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But history tells us it can always be worse.""","Israel may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime's hold on power. Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121850713,imgsize-1199755,width-400,resizemode-4/121850713.jpg"

The US State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for the Dominican Republic, warning American tourists to exercise increased caution amid a rise in violent crime, including robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides.The updated advisory, released Thursday, marks the second such notice in less than a year for the popular Caribbean destination. A Level 2 alert is the second-lowest in the State Department’s four-tier system but still signals elevated risk, particularly in urban areas frequented by tourists.Citing a troubling uptick in violent incidents, the advisory urges travellers to be vigilant and adopt a series of safety precautions: remain aware of surroundings, avoid displaying valuables, use phones discreetly, travel in groups, and refrain from leaving food or drinks unattended. In the event of a robbery, tourists are advised not to resist and to comply with demands.“If you are the victim of a crime,” the advisory says, “you can contact the local 911 service, tourist police (POLITUR), or resort security.” However, it also cautions that perpetrators are “rarely caught and prosecuted.”The Dominican Republic remains a popular getaway for American travellers, but officials stress that increased vigilance is essential as law enforcement struggles to curb crime.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",The US State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for the Dominican Republic.

Whether it is for goods or services… or the West Midlands as a whole, there is so much good stuff here to celebrate,” the minister added.The UK government estimates the deal could boost bilateral trade by GBP 25.5 billion annually in the long term.

Whenever Scott Foster steps on the court, it brings relief to the side that is lagging in the series. Coincidentally, the referee has been a part of all those games, where the lagging team got a lifeline. As a result, he earned the nickname, ‘The Extender.’ However, apart from being a lucky charm for the lagging side, he has come under the scanner on several instances where his decisions created controversy.Recently, Scott officiated Game 4 between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder. As expected, the Oklahoma City Thunder made a comeback and saved themselves another chance by evening the series 2-2. His decisions caused uproar among fans at various points during the crucial game, the most prominent one being Alex Caruso given a clean chit despite fouling on Tyrese Haliburton.Here are the top 5 controversial decisions given by Scott Foster, which drew angry fan reactions and also led the NBA to rescind them, at times.Chris Paul never denied having a beef against Scott Foster, and why wouldn’t he? Paul’s teams were 0-13 in the playoff losses, a streak that they finally broke in 2023.The same year, while playing against the Phoenix Suns, Chris Paul was controversially ejected from the Golden State Warriors by Scott.The decision did not go well among the fraternity, and the rumors swirled in NBA circles that there was money acting behind the call.Scott Foster was a part of the 2023 NBA Denver Nuggets-Miami Heat final as the replay center official. Though behind the screen, he continued to cause a stir among fans with his controversial calls. In one of the disputed fouls made by Aaron Gordon, he upheld the decision and stripped Jimmy Butler of a three-pointer.The decision sparked social media debate, where fans did not hold back their thoughts about Foster and his dubious calls.2023 seemed to be a year full of Scott Foster horror for the NBA fans. He made the most controversial calls that year. One such decision was later rescinded by the NBA on the grounds of an erroneous decision.The foul in question is a technical foul given to Jaylen Brown in Game 7 between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. Scott stuck to his decision despite the video showing that Brown just reacted to a push and didn’t make an intentional contact.Brown later said to reporters, “I don’t know which way I should have responded to it. But if I didn’t do anything, it probably would have played on. And here comes Scott Foster, right away before even deciphering the situation, gives me a tech.”The decision was later retracted by the NBA.Foster seemed unnecessarily aggressive towards Nikola Jokic during Game 4 of the 2023 NBA Finals. He called Jokic for a fifth foul. Interestingly, the contact was not at all conspicuous and could have easily been shrugged off. Scott went on to call it a technical foul, leading to a frenzy among fans.One Reddit user ranted on his handle:“Scott Foster legitimately is crooked… one or two pieces of coincidental evidence may be bad luck… but Foster has a whole fucking book of coincidental evidence of rigging”The call reflected badly on Jokic’s team Denver Nuggets, who had to send their star performer to the bench for a significant period.The peak of hate towards Scott Foster for his erroneous and inconsistent officiating was seen in 2024. In a game played in March 2024 between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Cleveland Cavaliers, Foster called Rudy Gobert for a foul. Gobert could not contain his resentment and responded with a ‘money sign’ alluding to Foster’s probable involvement in betting.The reaction from Gobert cost him a $100,000 fine. He apologized later for the gesture and the loss it brought to the team.Also Read: Referee Scott Foster suffers bloody nose injuries early in Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves’ Game 2 Scott Foster’s inconsistent officiating has always been a pain for NBA fans.

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Wayne Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina Gretzky stands to inherit millions from her father, hockey legend Wayne Gretzki.

KG will surely be in the Hall of Fame one day,” Bavuma said, reflecting the deep camaraderie in the side.Rabada, visibly emotional, described the victory as a culmination of years of frustration and near-misses for South African cricket. “We’ve seen the heartbreak over the years. This is for our past players and our people back home.

Kylie Kelce’s honest talk with her mom about sex before marriage will leave you stunned

Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie Kelce opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball.

A new leadership duet in Los Angeles Lakers

Early glimpses of success and struggle





When Luka Doncic walked into the Lakers locker room, he didn’t just bring talent — he brought tension, too. The February blockbuster trade sent Anthony Davis packing and handed LeBron James a new challenge: sharing control. While wins piled up early, playoff heartbreak and quiet chemistry gaps revealed the truth—this partnership is still in its early steps. Can two legends learn to lead together before the moment passes?February 2, 2025, marked a significant midseason trade for the Lakers: they traded Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick to Dallas, bringing in Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris. This was the first midseason trade involving two current All-NBA players. LeBron was taken aback at first—believing it was a joke during a family dinner in New York—before coming to terms with the fact that a new era was upon them.At first, there were some questions, but it didn't take long for signs of unity to pop up. LeBron gave a shoutout to Luka for his locker room presence, saying he has a knack for ""instilling confidence in his teammates."" Doncic shared that feeling, referring to the enthusiastic reception he got before the game as a ""significant moment"" that bonded the players and staff.When they were playing, LeBron compared their synergy to that of a quarterback and wide receiver, noting how Luka’s insight and his scoring talent mesh perfectly.In their fourth matchup, the Lakers took control against the Nuggets, with Doncic scoring 32 points, grabbing 10 rebounds, and dishing out 7 assists, while LeBron contributed 25 points and 9 rebounds, leading to seven consecutive victories and a 39–21 record. However, building chemistry doesn’t just happen. A first-round playoff loss to Minnesota revealed weaknesses: lack of frontcourt depth, exhaustion, and defensive lapses.Even now, there are little signs pointing to a growing connection. Analysts have observed the clear synergy between the duo on the court, but their locker-room 'handshakes' seem a bit flat—indicating that their chemistry is still in the early stages. LeBron has taken on the role of a friendly mentor—giving elbow bumps and sharing advice—but these stars are still figuring out how to trust one another beyond just the numbers.Luka Doncic’s debut with the Lakers has been quite the show—it’s a change that really rocks the foundation of a franchise built around LeBron James. While the early wins suggested a bright future, the playoff setbacks and the need for patience in the locker room reveal that this is a journey, not an instant solution. The base is strong, leadership is collaborative, and confidence is shared—but the Lakers now have to bolster their supporting cast, improve their defense, and cultivate team harmony.Also Read: “He Might Not Be from This Planet” — JaVale McGee recalls watching Stephen Curry drain 100 unbelievable practice Shots If LeBron and Doncic get the locker-room dance down, this partnership could totally transform Lakers basketball.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia made comments on Air India crash that X users found insensitive.





Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia who recently mocked the Indian economy, mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"". In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, Bhatia asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive at the time of grieving.""Do you really think the 4th largest economy in the world should still be having plane crashes due to systemic failures? Time to question what truly makes a nation great,"" Bhatia posted.Social media users reminded him that there have been 55 deadly plane crashes in the US in 2025 alone to which Bhatia retorted that US has a greater number of flights as well.""Sabeer wants the attention he has lost. He wants to remind the world that he still exists,"" one wrote. ""Vulture spotted,"" another wrote. Interestingly, Bhatia engaged with all comments and even ran a poll on whether he should take an Air India flight or not.""Of course I’m deeply saddened and devastated by the loss of life. But that distracts from the real question: Why did it happen and what can we do as a society to prevent it from ever happening again?"" he wrote.""In all the angry replies I’m getting, people are responding as if their own families were on the plane. Telling me to put my phone down. So much hate, so much emotion. Where’s the logic? Do you really go through life like it’s a Bollywood movie?"" Bhatia wrote.""The right words aren’t “devastated” or “pained by the tragic loss” — those center the speaker. Say instead: “The families of the victims are in our thoughts and prayers.” It’s about them, not you,"" he added.""In the past few days of vitriolic backlash, I keep hearing the term “colonial mindset” — as if the West looks down on India. That’s simply untrue. What shocks people in the West isn’t India — it’s the poor decisions of its leaders. If anything, that is the real colonial hangover,"" he said.","Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"" In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, he asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121834649,imgsize-36708,width-400,resizemode-4/121834649.jpg"

WhatsApp & Facebook status ideas

Some relationships and bonds in life are so important and precious that words can't define them. Such is the bond between a father and child that doesn't need a constant stream of words or Instagram-worthy affection. While moms often wear their hearts on their sleeves, dads don’t express much, their love is often silent, steady, and always showing up with a solution (or at least a toolbox).They may not always say “I love you,” but it’s there—in the extra roti they sneak onto your plate, the way they silently wait in the car while you’re 30 minutes late, and the list can go on. Sure, love like that should be celebrated every day, but Father’s Day gives us an official excuse to make some noise about it. So on Sunday, June 15, 2025, ditch the boring tie, prep your best one-liner, and celebrate the man who taught you how to live, laugh, and lock the main door twice every night.Happy Father's Day! Thanks for pretending to know how to fix everything with duct tape.""To the man who taught me how to parallel park… and then silently judged me for a decade—Happy Father’s Day!""""Happy Father’s Day!

It’s a day set aside for honoring one's father, as well as fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society.

This day recognizes not just fathers, but the father figures in our lives.Father's Day is an annual observance honoring people's fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. It was first proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, in 1909. It was originally celebrated at the YMCA on June 19, 1910, by Sonora Smart Dodd, who was born in Arkansas. Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, was a single parent who raised his six children there.Father's Day celebrations typically involve showing appreciation for fathers and father figures through gifts, thoughtful gestures, and spending quality time together. Popular activities include planning family meals, outdoor adventures, or enjoying hobbies together.

There are many bonds in life that are worth celebrating for the emotions and value they hold for us. They make life a more memorable experience and give us moments that are cherished forever. One such relationship is that between a father and his child. While moms are expressive with their emotions and more open to communicating their feelings, dads are the silent pillars of strength and love who might not share how much they love you, but their love is always evident in their actions.While one should celebrate the special relations in one's life every day, a day dedicated to a forever bond like a father-child relationship must be honoured.

Thus, in 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson issued a proclamation announcing the third Sunday of June as the day to honour fathers and in 1972 President Richard Nixon signed the law to federally recognise Father's Day. Over the years, Father's Day is celebrated in the United States on the third Sunday of June, which is on June 19, 2025, this year.Today, Father's Day is recognized in over 110 countries and is celebrated on the third Sunday of June in many.

Gastroenterologist shares 3 effective remedies to relieve farting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/gastroenterologist-shares-3-effective-remedies-to-relieve-farting/articleshow/121830797.cms,"Experiencing embarrassing gas? Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab suggests remedies like simethicone to break up gas bubbles and peppermint tea for abdominal relief. Pepto Bismol can also reduce odor. The article further advises eating slowly, limiting gas-producing foods, avoiding gum and carbonated drinks, and quitting smoking to manage excessive flatulence.

Peppermint

King Charles’ Cancer CONFIRMED As ‘Incurable’? Royal Health Secret Finally Revealed | Shocking Update

Poll Do you think natural remedies and lifestyle changes are effective ways to manage excessive gas? Yes, natural remedies help Sometimes medical treatment is needed

Pepto bismol

How to reduce farting naturally

Eat slowly

Limit gas-producing foods such as certain carbohydrates, complex sugars, and insoluble fibres

Avoid chewing gum

Avoid soda, beer, and other carbonated drinks

Quit smoking

Increase physical activity

Farting is a natural byproduct of a healthy digestive system, but in some occasions it can be embarrassing. Dr Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist has recently shared some effective remedies to relieve farting. He was reacting to a woman's video on 'the most diabolical behaviour on the plane'. The woman complained about a fellow passenger 'farting' in the plane, and the passenger getting restless. “Try this remedy if you or someone around you has bad gas,” the doctor shared.Dr. Salhab’s top recommendation is simethicone. This is an over-the-counter medication to relieve gas. “It breaks up the gas bubbles in your gastrointestinal tract,” the gastroenterologist explained in his Instagram video. This medication works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to combine and pass more easily. It can be used as a quick relief, especially in situations like air travel, where bloating and gas can worsen due to cabin pressure changes.One home remedy for gas is sipping peppermint tea. “It will help with abdominal pain and spasms,” the doctor said. Peppermint tea can help relieve bloating and gas. It contains menthol, which has antispasmodic properties that relax the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, it will reduce cramping and ease the passage of gas Peppermint tea also provides in calming effect on both the stomach and the discomfort associated with excessive flatulence.The third remedy on Dr. Salhab's list is Pepto Bismol. “You can take something like Pepto Bismol. It binds to the sulfur within your gastrointestinal tract, and makes it less smelly,” he said. The active ingredient, bismuth subsalicylate, reacts with sulfur compounds in the gut, and thereby decreases the foul smell of gas. This medication is available in liquid, tablet, or chewable forms.Farting is absolutely harmless. A healthy individual farts around 14 times a day. Though it may sound like a lot, most farts are odorless and relatively undetectable. What you eat also plays a crucial role in farting . Here are five tips to control excessive farting.If excessive farting persists, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions.","Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab suggests simethicone to break up gas bubbles and peppermint tea for abdominal relief.

Dementia Symptoms: 5 signs of dementia that show up in normal conversation: How casual chat can reveal the early symptoms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/5-signs-of-dementia-that-show-up-in-normal-conversation-how-casual-chat-can-reveal-the-early-symptoms/articleshow/121819137.cms,"Struggling to find the right word and repeating the same conversation



Losing track of the conversation and using lots of fillers



Getting names and titles wrong—repeatedly



Sudden silence or losing their train of thought



Withdrawing from conversations altogether



Why these subtle signs matter



What to do if you notice these signs



Most of us don’t expect dementia to creep into everyday chats. It’s something we associate with memory loss, getting lost in familiar places, or forgetting faces. But here’s the thing: some of the earliest signs of dementia quietly show up when someone’s just talking.A casual chat over coffee, a phone call with an old friend, or even a family dinner can reveal little clues that indicates something isn’t quite right.And no, it’s not always about forgetting words—it can be much subtler than that.So, if you’ve noticed that someone close to you—maybe a parent, grandparent, or even a younger relative—is acting a little off in conversations, it might be worth paying attention. Let’s walk through the early signs of dementia that often show up in the most ordinary exchanges—and are often brushed off as “just aging.”Everyone has that “tip-of-the-tongue” moment now and then. But when it happens a lot—and the person uses vague words like “thing,” “stuff,” or “that guy” too often—it might be a red flag.Example: Instead of saying “microwave,” they might say, “the hot box” or “that thing that heats food.” It’s not just forgetfulness—it’s difficulty accessing familiar vocabulary.This one’s easy to miss because it sounds harmless: someone tells a story, and five minutes later, they tell it again.You smile politely, maybe tease them a little, but inside, you're wondering.In dementia, short-term memory loss can make people forget they’ve just said something—even though they remember what happened in 1965 with crystal clarity.Imagine you’re talking about your weekend plans, and suddenly the person jumps to a totally unrelated topic, like “Did I ever tell you about my neighbor’s cat?”This disconnection isn't just quirky—it could be a sign that their brain is having trouble following the flow of dialogue.“Um… well… you know… like… uh…” We all use fillers sometimes, especially when tired or distracted. But if someone starts relying on them constantly or struggles to form full sentences, it may signal trouble with language processing. They might know what they want to say but can’t organize the words.Calling their son by their brother’s name or referring to the Prime Minister as “that TV anchor guy” might not just be a slip-up. Consistently mixing up names—especially those of close family or public figures they know well—is worth noticing.Ever seen someone freeze mid-sentence like they just lost their place? It's not always dramatic, but it’s noticeable. In early dementia, people often pause as if the thread of the conversation just disappeared. They may even laugh it off with a “Where was I?” but inside, they may be frustrated or even scared.Maybe they used to be the life of the party, but now they sit quietly, smiling, avoiding eye contact, or nodding without much to say. That withdrawal isn’t always shyness or fatigue—it might be because they’re struggling to keep up. It’s easier to stay silent than to risk embarrassment or confusion.The early stages of dementia aren’t always about obvious memory lapses. They’re about how the brain starts struggling with complex things—like conversation. Talking isn’t just chatting; it involves memory, vocabulary, emotional cues, sequencing, and processing speed. So when someone starts to fumble with everyday conversation, it can actually say a lot.Unfortunately, many of these signs are brushed off as “just aging” or “being tired.” But catching them early gives families more time to plan, get help, and make the person feel supported—not judged.Don’t panic. One or two moments doesn’t equal dementia. But if there’s a pattern, it’s worth noting.Start documenting. Keep track of what you’re noticing and how often it happens.Talk gently. If it’s someone close to you, try bringing it up in a loving way—“Hey, I’ve noticed a few things, and I just want to make sure you’re okay.”Encourage a doctor visit. A general check-up can help rule out other causes like stress, vitamin deficiencies, or medication side effects.Stay supportive. Above all, remember: people with early dementia often know something is wrong before anyone else does. What they need most is kindness, patience, and support—not fear or shame.Dementia doesn't always shout—it whispers. And often, the first place it speaks up is in conversation. So the next time you're chatting with an elderly parent, an older neighbor, or even a middle-aged friend—listen closely. You might catch something that seems small now but could make a big difference down the line.Because when it comes to dementia, the earlier we notice, the better we can help. Regular health checkups can help to detect illnesses.","The early stages of dementia aren’t always about obvious memory lapses.

Happy Father's Day!

For most people, their father is the person they look up to. Fathers are not just providers, but they are also our mentors and biggest supporters. Through their guidance and sheer presence, they help in shaping us into the adult we turn into. And so, to honour and celebrate fathers and father-figures and their self-less love for their children, Father’s Day is celebrated each year on the third Sunday of June. It is a special occasion dedicated to appreciating fathers, father figures, and paternal bonds. Celebrated around the world, it’s a time to say “thank you” to the men who guide, protect, and support us throughout life.The roots of Father’s Day can be traced back to the early 20th century in the United States. Inspired by Mother’s Day, which had become an official holiday in 1914, a Spokane, Washington woman named Sonora Smart Dodd campaigned to honour her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. And so, the first large-scale Father’s Day was celebrated in Spokane on June 19, 1910. Though US President Woodrow Wilson and later President Calvin Coolidge supported the idea, it wasn’t until 1972 that President Richard Nixon officially designated the third Sunday in June as a national holiday to celebrate Father's Day.Over the years, people started celebrating Father's Day across the world in different countries. Today, this special day for fathers and father-figures is observed in over 70 countries, though the dates and customs vary. In Germany, for example, fathers sometimes celebrate by going on “gentlemen’s hikes” with beer wagons in tow, while in Thailand, Father’s Day honours the King as a father figure to the nation.And so, this is a day to honour, appreciate and celebrate fathers and father-figures and acknowledge their role in shaping who we become. It is also a day for family get-togethers to spend quality time with dads; this in turn helps strengthen relationships and family bonds.To help you wish your father or the father-figures in your life on this special day, here we list some wishes, messages, and quotes that you can send this on this occasion:See more: Happy Father's Day 2025: Top 80 Wishes, Messages, Images, Greetings, GIFs and Quotes to make your Dad feel extra special 1.

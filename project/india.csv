NSA starts probe into GPS spoofing at IGI airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nsa-starts-probe-into-gps-spoofing-at-igi-airport/articleshow/125237557.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The office of National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented GPS spoofing IGI Airport has been facing for the past few weeks. NSA is learnt to be coordinating with multiple aviation and defence agencies on this issue as spoofing has been usually common in conflict zones.Due to this phenomenon, planes coming to land often get wrong location or heading signals and false terrain warnings about 60 nautical miles from the airport.This is the first time that the Delhi airport has been facing this issue. The 'automatic terminal information service' for IGIA has been regularly issuing alerts about spoofing and the airlines have been accordingly informing their pilots.While security agencies are tackling the source of this interference, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on Monday cleared the promulgation of category-1 (CAT-I) instrument landing system (ILS) at IGIA's warhorse runway 10/28's 10 on the Dwarka side. Now, Airports Authority of India is likely to issue a notice to airmen by Tuesday.DGCA expedited this process from the original date of Nov 27 due to the spoofing. This will help an aircraft land from the Dwarka side on the main runway (10/28) when easterlies are blowing even if GPS spoofing is taking place.Without ILS, aircraft can land using 'required navigation performance', but it requires GPS and spoofing had affected flight movement on the main runway a few times in the recent past.The inability to land on runway 10 end had led to congestion at India's busiest airport, which now handles about 1,550 daily flights and some flights had to divert to alternate airports like Jaipur.Delhi International Airport Ltd has warned that ""some flight schedules may be impacted"" on Tuesday as ""mandatory flight calibration of ILS will take place between 11.30am and 1.30pm as part of continuous safety practices"". Flights will be ""regulated during this period"". Accordingly, DIAL has advised passengers to ""coordinate with airlines to get updated flight information status"".All the runways at IGIA are scheduled for calibration every six months. On Tuesday, sources say, the ILS of runway 29 left (29L), which is closest to the Gurgaon side and used for arrivals, is due for calibration.",NSA Ajit Doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented GPS spoofing IGI Airport has been facing for the past few weeks.

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

Top Bengaluru Jail Official Transferred, 2 Suspended After Viral Videos Spark Outrage





BENGALURU: Yet another video from Bengaluru Central Prison has surfaced on social media, deepening the ongoing controversy over illegal activities inside the high-security facility.The new clip, allegedly recorded inside the Parappana Agrahara jail, shows inmates partying, dancing, and drinking liquor and consuming non-vegetarian food while using plates and mugs as makeshift musical instruments according to news agency PTI.The video which went viral on Sunday shows disposable glasses filled with alcohol arranged alongside plates of cut fruits and fried peanuts. Inmates can be seen cheering, shouting, and dancing to the clanging of utensils, turning the barrack into what appears to be a party zone.The emergence of this new footage comes close on the heels of earlier videos showing high-profile inmates, including serial rapist Umesh Reddy and Islamic State (IS) handler Juhad Hamid Shakil Manna, using mobile phones and watching television inside the same prison.Those videos — some recorded as far back as 2023 — had triggered a massive row, exposing lapses in jail surveillance and control.Reacting to the fresh video, home minister G Parameshwara said the government would take “stringent action against officials, including jail superintendents” for the repeated lapses inside Bengaluru Central Prison.""If the report is not satisfactory, I will constitute a committee to investigate the matter. We will take action against the officials concerned and implement corrective measures to prevent such incidents in the future. I will not tolerate this nonsense — enough is enough,” Parameshwara said.He added that the state government had already approved the installation of CCTVs and mobile jammers in prisons to prevent such violations, but the measures were not fully implemented.“Despite repeated incidents from Parappana Agrahara jail, the problem persists. Though mobile jammers and CCTVs have been approved for installation to prevent such violations, the prisons have failed to implement them,” he said.Officials from the prison department said ADGP (Prisons) B Dayananda has ordered a high-level probe to identify the source of the leaked videos, those responsible for smuggling phones and liquor inside, and any officials complicit in the racket. Additional inspector general of police (prisons) PV Anand Reddy also visited the jail premises to assess the situation.A senior prison officer described the incident as a “major security breach,” warning that the use of mobile phones by terror suspects could allow them to contact handlers of banned outfits or radicalise other inmates.The Bengaluru Central Prison has frequently been in the spotlight for misconduct — from actor Darshan Thoogudeepa allegedly being allowed to use phones and smoke on the lawn, to gold smuggling case accused Ranya Rao’s associate Tarun Raju being filmed with a mobile phone earlier this year.","Video from Bengaluru Central Prison shows inmates partying with liquor and makeshift instruments.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.





BENGALURU: Former grocery store chain owner Ravi Prasad Reddy of Hebbagodi, arrested on charges of murdering two friends, had become a vegetable vendor after incurring a loss of around Rs 5 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic.Around 60 people to whom he lent money or with whom he had invested in chit funds, died or left the city during the pandemic, causing him a huge loss, police investigations have revealed.Reddy, 40, allegedly murdered tea shop owner R Madesh (41), who was also involved in the chit-fund business, and Balappa Reddy (61), who owned a metal fabrication factory — to rob them and demand ransom. Reddy was arrested from a bar close to his home Saturday afternoon.The accused was shot at and injured in both knees when he tried to attack police personnel near a burial ground at Bommasandra, where he was taken for a spot investigation late Saturday night.Police picked up Reddy's two associates — Dhanush and Sateesh — for questioning as they accompanied him during Balappa's abduction on Nov 6. Reddy's elder sister, Sunanda, is also on the radar as she was allegedly in the same vehicle during the abduction.Police are yet to question her.""We intensified our investigation and questioned the bereaved family members about those with whom the two victims had financial dealings. This is how we zeroed in on the suspect. Special teams of CCB and Hebbagodi police were formed to nab the suspect,"" city police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh told TOI.The two murdered men were Reddy's close friends and he claimed to have lent them money earlier.""But they refused to lend me money when I was in deep trouble. This made me develop hatred towards them,"" police quoted Reddy as saying. Cops are also investigating whether Reddy owed them any money.Reddy, from Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, set up his chain of Happy Family Stores with help from his uncle. He earned good profits, lent money to others, and invested almost Rs 5 crore in chit funds, an investigating officer said.When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, defaults by his debtors forced him to sell his house and a plot of land near Hebbagodi for Rs 2 crore. He also leased out his stores to his relatives. Despite these efforts, more financial losses compelled his wife and two children to live with his uncle, while Reddy moved to a small house rented from Balappa, one of the victims.To rebuild his life, Reddy set up a vegetable stall and brought Dhanush and Sateesh from Andhra Pradesh to help him with the business.Inspiration drawn from crime filmsAccording to Reddy, movies showing people kidnapping victims for ransom encouraged him to do so. He planned to kidnap the two men and release them after receiving ransom. He purchased an air pistol, a metal detector, and knives. Reddy told cops that he wanted to use the metal detector to find hidden treasures.""Investigations revealed that Reddy hatched his conspiracy for around three months. First, he targeted Madesh on Nov 4,"" deputy commissioner of police (Electronics City division) M Narayana told TOI.Reddy was aware that Madesh, who was constructing a house, had Rs 10 lakh in cash stashed there. ""Knowing he would be alone in the under-construction building, I entered the house and threatened Madesh at knifepoint, demanding the money. But he resisted and shouted for help before running away. I chased him and attacked him with a knife. Seeing some neighbours coming out, I sped away on my scooter,"" police quoted Reddy as saying.Reddy waited for two days and decided on his next move as nobody suspected him. This time, he drove an MUV of an advocate-friend to Balappa's factory. Saying he had a business deal to discuss, he made Balappa join him in the vehicle.""He drove the MUV in the direction of Hosur and stopped at a desolate place. Then, he demanded money from Balappa who refused. In a fit of anger, Reddy attacked Balappa with the same knife he used in killing Madesh. Then, he brought the body back to his Hebbagodi residence, shifted it to his goods autorickshaw, and returned the MUV after removing stains.

Terror Angle in Delhi Blast Not Ruled Out: PM Modi Briefed, Home Minister Amit Shah Calls NIA, NSG

NEW DELHI: No craters, no shrapnel or pellets - this was the first impression of the forensic and anti-terror experts who arrived at the spot after the car bomb explosion near the Red Fort on Monday evening. While it puzzled the investigators, a plausible explanation soon emerged with some experts saying that it was possible that a crater may not be formed if the car was in motion.""It could be a highly inflammable chemical, which may have caused the casualties. It's a high-end explosive material,"" said a source, hinting at the possible use of a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX. However, a detailed blast analysis report will confirm or deny these theories, he added. A possible link with the Faridabad seizure was also being actively explored.All angles are being probed and National Investigation Agency is likely to take over the probe into the FIR, which was being filed by Delhi Police late on Monday.The initial probe led police to a man named Salman from Gurgaon, who allegedly owned the 'HR 26 7674' i20 car involved in the blast. He told police that he had sold the car to someone named Devendra in March. Police then contacted the RTO to fetch further details of the sellers.Fictitious IDs were used and one of them was also of a Pulwama resident, said a cop.However, the multiplicity of ownership of the vehicle raised eyebrows as this was a preferred modus operandi of terrorist groups while choosing a vehicle for SVB-IED (suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device) attacks.As there were at least three people in the car, police suspect that there may be a possibility that it was a hired/rented car because suicide attacks usually involve one-two persons.A crucial aspect, as also pointed out by home minister Amit Shah, is the analysis of footage from over 230 CCTV cameras. While it has helped police establish the route taken by the vehicle, it also provided them with the registration number.Investigators are grappling with many unanswered questions, including the presence of three people in the car and its outstation numberplate.","No craters, no shrapnel or pellets - this was the first impression of the forensic and anti-terror experts who arrived at the spot after the car bomb explosion near the Red Fort on Monday evening.

Delhi Red Fort Blast: First lead to terror plot came from Jaish posters in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-lead-to-terror-plot-came-from-jaish-posters-in-kashmir/articleshow/125235085.cms,"Security personnel on guard in Anantnag following the arrest of Kulgam resident Dr Adeel, accused in an interstate terror module

NEW DELHI: The first lead in J&K police's investigation into Jaish-e-Muhammed's multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors - now busted with nine arrests and a massive haul of over 2,900 kgs of explosives, bomb-making material and two AK-series weapons so far - was as innocuous as a set of Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.The Jaish posters threatening attacks on security forces - common until 2019 but a rare occurrence now - fuelled the curiosity of Srinagar SSP G V Sundeep Chakravarthy, who had also led the J&K police component in Operation Mahadev that neutralised the three Pahalgam attackers. He insisted on finding out who put up the posters; and CCTV camera footage nailed three overground workers with a history of stone-pelting.They were arrested and their interrogation led the police to a cleric in Shopian, Maulvi Irfan Ahmad. Irfan's questioning would, over the next 2-3 weeks, unveil a sinister Jaish plot - with links across J&K, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - leading to a string of arrests.Those arrested so far include Kashmiri doctors working at Faridabad's Al-Falah University, Muzammil Ganaie hailing from Pulwama; Adeel Ahmad Rather, originally from Qazigund but picked up from Saharanpur; and Dr Shaheen Sayeed hailing from Lucknow and Muzammil's purported girlfriend.A fourth doctor, Dr Umar, who hails from Pulwama, is however absconding.Also in custody are the three overground workers behind the Nowgam posters; Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, a Mewat cleric who arranged the logistics in Faridabad; Maulvi Irfan and his aide from Ganderbal Zameer Ahmad Ahanger alias Mutlasha who led the J&K police to Muzammil.Though Maulvi was not talking initially, a mobile device picked up from his house showed a Telegram channel operated by Pakistan-based Jaish terrorist Umar bin Khattab, confirming that he was in touch with Irfan.One of Irfan's terror recruits, Mutlasha, also came under the scanner for being part of another pan-India terror chat group by the name Farzandan e Darul Uloom Deoband. Irfan eventually said he had seen an AK-47 in the house of a doctor he had radicalised. Mutlasha confirmed the identity of the doctor as Dr Muzammil Ganaie. Muzammil was traced to Al-Falah University in Faridabad, Haryana, where he was working with Dr Adeel and Dr Umar.Though interrogation is underway to establish how these explosives were to be used, investigators suspect a conspiracy to carry out terror attacks in the hinterland, with Delhi an obvious target given its proximity to Faridabad. ""Idea was to use the cover of being medical professionals to escape suspicion. Given the massive quantity of explosives and other bomb-making material, it seems they were collected over two years,"" an officer connected with the investigation told TOI.","J&K police's investigation into Jaish-e-Muhammed's multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors busted with nine arrests.

Faridabad Terror Plot: Woman Doctor Arrested After AK-47 Recovery, Experts Hint at Pakistan Link

Cops probing if Faridabad univ lab was used for making RDX

GURGAON/SRINAGAR: A Kashmiri medical professor's arrest has triggered one of the largest counterterrorism hauls in recent years, with investigators in J&K, Haryana and UP uncovering nearly 2,900kg of IED-making material, multiple assault rifles, pistols, chemicals, electronics and flammable substances.Police said a transnational module tied to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind had allegedly embedded itself within academic and professional circles, using encrypted channels, charitable fronts and university networks to move funds, radicalise recruits and assemble explosives. The investigation began after threatening JeM posters appeared at several locations in Srinagar's Bunpora Nowgam area on Oct 19.An FIR under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act was filed at Nowgam police station. Tracking the trail led police to what they described as a ""white-collar terror ecosystem"" of radicalised professionals and students allegedly in touch with handlers in Pakistan and other countries.Muzamil Shakeel, 35, a doctor from J&K's Pulwama teaching at Al-Falah University in Faridabad's Dhauj, was arrested October 30 after J&K police linked him to the posters. He managed the university hospital's emergency wing and taught medical students.His questioning led Haryana and J&K police to two rented locations in Dhauj. Searches on Saturday at a room he allegedly took 15 days before his arrest yielded 358kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, a Krinkov assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live cartridges, a pistol, & bomb-making paraphernalia.Searches on Saturday at a room Muzamil Shakeel allegedly took 15 days before his arrest yielded arms, ammunition, explosive material and bomb-making paraphernalia: 12 suitcases and a bucket packed with explosives, 20 timers, batteries, remote controls, 5kg heavy metal, and a walkie-talkie set.Searches expanded Monday to Dehar Colony, also in Dhauj, where police found an additional 2,563kg of explosives and flammable material. Seized weapons include a Chinese pistol, a Beretta pistol, an AK-56 rifle, and a Krinkov rifle - all with ammunition. ""The sheer volume of material points to plans for large-scale terrorist attacks,"" a police officer said.Faridabad police spokesperson Yashpal said teams were working to identify accomplices, trace procurement chains, and determine the weapons' source. ""Raids are being carried out at multiple locations linked to the accused,"" he said.Investigators have detained several people allegedly connected to Muzamil, including a religious scholar from a mosque near the university. Police said they are probing whether laboratory facilities at Al-Falah University were intended for synthesising advanced explosives such as RDX.An AK-47 allegedly linked to Muzamil was found in the Swift Dzire of a woman doctor from the same university. Officers said she has not been arrested and may have loaned her vehicle without knowing its use, but her role remains under scrutiny. She is currently being questioned in J&K.Before Muzamil's arrest, UP's Saharanpur police detained another Pulwama doctor - Adeel Majeed Rather. His interrogation led investigators to Dhauj and uncovered Muzamil's alleged storage facility.Faridabad police commissioner Satender Kumar Gupta said a terrorist module was being designed. ""Though I cannot reveal much as it concerns national security, joint teams of Haryana and J&K police have successfully busted a major terrorist network,"" he said, adding that more arrests were expected.J&K police announced a broader breakthrough, calling it a ""major counterterrorism operation"" that dismantled an inter-state and transnational module linked to JeM and AGuH. Arrests include Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil and Yasir-ul-Ashraf of Nowgam, Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid of Nowgam, Molvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, Zameer Ahmad Ahanger of Ganderbal, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie of Koil in Pulwama, and Dr Rather of Kulgam. Searches were carried out across Srinagar, Anantnag, Ganderbal, and Shopian, along with coordinated operations in Faridabad and Saharanpur.""Financial investigation regarding flow of funds is on and all linkages are being traced and addressed expeditiously,"" police said, adding that the operation reflects determination to dismantle alleged terrorist networks operating across state lines and from foreign soil.","Muzamil Shakeel, 35, a doctor from J&K's Pulwama teaching at Al-Falah University in Faridabad's Dhauj, was arrested October 30. Searches on Saturday at a room he allegedly took 15 days before his arrest yielded arms, ammunition, explosive material and bomb-making paraphernalia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125237175,imgsize-1016421,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-42.jpg"

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

NEW DELHI: As a grey blanket of smog smothered the city and Delhiites struggled to breathe, air pollution data went missing for a major portion of Monday. Since 1 pm, neither hourly air quality index (AQI) updates nor the city's daily average had been released till late evening, even as the air visibly worsened since the afternoon.While hourly AQI data for individual stations was back on the Central Pollution Control Board website around 9pm, there were gaps in readings at several monitors. There was no response from CPCB or the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to TOI's queries on the data outage.As per an independent analysis, the average PM2.5 concentration from 12am to 9pm on Monday was 249 micrograms per cubic metre as compared to 215 micrograms per cubic metre over the same period of the previous day. Based on these readings, the PM2.5 levels were near severe on Monday.Till early afternoon, when the last available readings were published, the city's average PM2.5 levels - the primary pollutant responsible for Delhi's foul air - were nearly identical to those recorded at the same time on Sunday. Yet, the corresponding AQI values were significantly higher, mirroring the palpable deterioration that residents could feel.By evening, visibility had dropped sharply and an acrid stench hung in the air. Roads and flyovers disappeared into a yellow-grey haze as people covered their faces and hurried indoors.""The CPCB has not updated any data since the afternoon and it's not the first time this has happened in the last two years. The data missing from such a crucial website at such a critical time, handicaps citizens, researchers and regulators in taking action to reduce pollution or initiate precautionary measures,"" said Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts.From 1pm onwards, data went missing from the CPCB website but was available on the DPCC portal. This indicated that the monitors were working and the glitch was elsewhere.By around 5.30pm, out of 562 stations across India, only 4 were live.Gurgaon's AQI 'cover story': Trees, walls & missing dataA thick smokescreen hung over the city till late Monday morning. It was much the same in Delhi, Noida and other parts of NCR. But while Delhi's AQI was 345 (very poor) and Noida's 318 (very poor), Gurgaon seemed to be breathing easier with an AQI of 221 (poor). What one saw didn't fit with what the data suggested.It's been like this through this peak pollution season, since Diwali, with Gurgaon's average AQI mostly better than other NCR cities. Since Diwali, Gurgaon has recorded only two very poor AQI days, 16 poor days and three moderate days.Within the same airshed, this can happen sometimes because of wind direction and hyperlocal meteorological factors. But when it sustains over a period of time, one has to look more closely at the data. In fact, place recording the data. That's what we did on Monday. It was revealing.All five continuous air monitoring stations - at Vikas Sadan, Sector 51, Teri Gram, Gwalpahari and Manesar - are close to thick foliage or near walls, violating CPCB rules that require monitors to be installed at least 20-30 metres from trees and 50 metres from major structures, in open and well-ventilated areas. The stations have also not consistently recorded PM2.5 and sulphur dioxide (SO₂) data, lowering the city's AQI averages. Gwalpahari and Teri Gram recorded incomplete indices for several days. LED display boards at all five stations have, meanwhile, been non-functional for weeks.Over the years, vegetation within govt and institutional campuses has grown tall around these stations, trapping air and absorbing a share of pollutants before they reach the sensors. The ambience of the stations, in other words, is very different from the ambience of the road that hits you as you step out. ""Vegetation grew, but the monitors' locations stayed fixed,"" an official said.An analysis of CPCB's real-time data shows the Gwalpahari station failed to record PM2.5 levels for several hours on multiple days this month. Since AQI averages are based on available readings, missing data of PM2.5 - the pollutant most responsible for NCR's poor air - improves the average score. At Teri Gram, SO₂ data was missing for extended periods, which means one key gaseous pollutant wasn't factored in AQI calculations.""The stations are recording partial data and AQI looks better than it should. There are long gaps in data,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Centre for Science and Environment.""There is no live display, but the data is being generated every day. LED screens are unable to show data as they were shut down for several months,"" Krishan Kumar, regional officer, HSPCB, told TOI.","From 1pm onwards, data went missing from the CPCB website but was available on the DPCC portal. By around 5.30pm, out of 562 stations across India, only 4 were live.

Looking back at phase 1



Bihar is all set for the second and final phase of assembly elections on Tuesday, November 11, with the stakes high for both the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc. The electoral fate of 1,302 candidates, including over half a dozen ministers in the Nitish Kumar-led government, will be decided by 3.7 crore voters across 122 constituencies.Security arrangements have been tightened across Bihar, with more than four lakh personnel deployed to ensure smooth polling. Bomb disposal squads and paramilitary forces are on alert, and senior officials have been instructed to personally oversee arrangements on polling day.The final round of voting spans several northern and eastern districts -- West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Supaul, Araria, and Kishanganj -- any of which border Nepal.The Seemanchal belt, stretching across Araria, Kishanganj, and Supaul, is being closely watched for its religious and caste complexities. The Champaran region, on the other hand, will test the BJP’s hold among traditional upper-caste and OBC voters.This region holds a significant Muslim population, making it a decisive battleground for both alliances.For the NDA, which accuses the opposition of “protecting infiltrators,” and for the INDIA bloc, which relies heavily on minority support, the Seemanchal vote could shape the final outcome.Among the most high-profile candidates is Bijendra Prasad Yadav, a veteran JD(U) leader and the state’s senior-most cabinet member, who seeks to retain his Supaul seat for an eighth term.His colleague Prem Kumar (BJP), contesting from Gaya Town, hopes for an eighth straight victory since 1990. Other ministers in the fray include Renu Devi (Bettiah), Neeraj Kumar Singh “Bablu” (Chhatapur), Leshi Singh (Dhamdaha), Sheela Mandal (Phulparas), and Zama Khan (Chainpur).Former deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad of the BJP will test his strength in Katihar, aiming for a fifth consecutive term.For smaller NDA allies like Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), this phase is a litmus test.HAM, which is contesting six seats, including Imamganj (held by Manjhi’s daughter-in-law Dipa), will look to retain its turf.RLM, still new to Bihar politics, has fielded Upendra Kushwaha’s wife Snehlata (Sasaram) and Madhaw Anand (Madhubani), both making their debut.On the INDIA bloc’s side, Congress state president Rajesh Kumar is defending Kutumba, while CPI(ML)’s Mehboob Alam (Balrampur) and Congress’s Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa) aim for hat-trick wins.A fresh face to watch is Chanakya Prakash Ranjan, son of JD(U) MP Giridhari Yadav, who defected to the RJD and is contesting Belhar — a contest that’s stirred interest for its dynastic twist.This phase also features several political turncoats:Voting will take place at 45,399 polling stations, with 40,073 in rural areas. Of the 3.7 crore voters, 1.75 crore are women, and more than half (2.28 crore) are aged between 30 and 60 years.The Hisua seat in Nawada has the largest electorate at 3.67 lakh, while Lauria, Chanpatia, Raxaul, Triveniganj, Sugauli, and Banmakhi each have 22 candidates vying for victory.The first phase of polling, held across 121 constituencies, recorded the highest-ever voter turnout in the state's electoral history, over 65%, setting the stage for a nail-biting finale in phase 2.","Bihar is all set for the second and final phase of assembly elections on Tuesday, November 11. The electoral fate of 1,302 candidates will be decided by 3.7 crore voters across 122 constituencies. Security arrangements have been tightened across Bihar, with more than four lakh personnel deployed to ensure smooth polling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125229036,imgsize-1690166,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Doctor Linked To ISIS-Khorasan Held For Plotting Ricin Mass Attack Across Major Indian Cities

AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old Hyderabad doctor arrested in Gujarat with drone-smuggled weapons from Pakistan and materials to produce the deadly toxin ricin was identified Sunday as the central figure in an IS-sponsored terrorist plot to strike multiple Indian cities.Two other suspects in the conspiracy, a tailor from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli and a student from Lakhimpur Kheri, were traced to Banaskantha.Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash, from which ricin is extracted.He was on the move when investigators intercepted his silver hatchback at Adalaj toll plaza on Ahmedabad-Mehsana Road.Saiyed's call records led to the arrest of UP natives Azad Suleman Sheikh, 20, and Mohammad Suhail Mohammad Saleem Khan, 23. Both had been allegedly supplying firearms and cartridges to the doctor, who has an MBBS from China, officials said.Ricin is a highly toxic poison derived from castor beans after the oil has been extracted. The substance has no known antidote if ingested, inhaled or injected. Castor oil, which is used for skincare and in various commercial products, does not contain the toxin.ATS officers said Saiyed had been in contact with Abu Khadija, an Afghanistan-based operative linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The doctor had been allegedly producing ricin in large quantities, possibly for mass poisoning, he said.The suspect conducted reconnaissance of unspecified security-sensitive sites in Lucknow, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The weapons came from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. Saiyed and the other arrested men told interrogators that their handler used drones from Pakistan to deliver arms across the border.Deputy SP SL Chaudhary led the operation to bust the module based on initial intelligence about Saiyed's movements in Ahmedabad.An FIR was registered at the ATS police station against all three arrested men and Abu Khadija, who is on the run, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act. A local court gave ATS custody of Saiyed until Nov 17. The other two suspects will be produced in court separately. ATS officials said investigations were continuing to identify and arrest other operatives involved in the conspiracy.","Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash.

300-Kg Explosives, Weapons, Timers: J&K Police Stop Deadly Terror Plot Targeting North India In Time

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor from Lucknow was arrested on Monday for her alleged involvement in a terror module operating across Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, officials told news agency PTI. An AK-47 rifle was recovered from her vehicle, they added.The accused, identified as Dr Shaheen, was arrested along with seven others, including Kashmiri doctor Muzammil Ganaie, who was picked up in Faridabad.Dr Shaheen was flown to Srinagar for custodial interrogation.According to officials, the arrests led to the seizure of 2,900 kg of explosives and uncovered what they described as a “white collar” network linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.The operation was carried out jointly by police forces of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, along with central agencies. Officials declined to specify the exact dates of the arrests, citing ongoing investigations.Police in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have recovered a large quantity of explosives and weapons from a rented apartment in Faridabad, following the arrest of a Pulwama-based doctor suspected of links with the Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed group.Officials said around 360 kg of a highly inflammable substance, believed to be ammonium nitrate, was seized along with arms and bomb-making material.The haul included an assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live rounds, a pistol with eight live cartridges, two empty cartridges, two spare magazines, 12 suitcases, a bucket filled with the explosive substance, 20 timers, four batteries, remote controls, five kilograms of heavy metal and a walkie-talkie set.Police believe the materials were meant for large-scale terror attacks.The recovery followed the arrest of Dr Adil Ahmad Rather from Pulwama, who was detained in Saharanpur. His questioning led investigators to Dr Muzammal, an assistant professor at Al-Falah University in Faridabad, who was arrested nearly ten days ago. A search of his rented accommodation resulted in Sunday’s seizure, officials added.","Dr Shaheen arrested along with seven others, including Kashmiri doctor Muzammil Ganaie.

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough against terror networks operating, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in coordination with Haryana Police, on Monday uncovered a large cache of explosives and arms from an apartment in Haryana’s Faridabad. Officials confirmed that 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Two persons — Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, an assistant professor at Al-Falah University, Faridabad, and Dr Adil Ahmad Rather, a doctor from Pulwama — were arrested in connection with the seizure. The operation, which had been under surveillance for over two weeks, is being described as one of the biggest terror-related recoveries in the Delhi-NCR region in recent years.According to Faridabad Commissioner of Police Satender Kumar Gupta, the seizure resulted from a coordinated effort between the Jammu and Kashmir Police and Haryana Police. “It is an ongoing joint operation between Haryana police and J&K police. An accused, Dr Muzammil, was nabbed. 360 kg of inflammable material was recovered yesterday, which is possibly ammonium nitrate. It is not RDX... The operation is still underway,” Gupta told reporters.Officials said the materials recovered from the apartment included a variety of electronic and explosive components, indicating preparation for potential large-scale attacks.“One assault rifle with three magazines and 83 live rounds, one pistol with eight live rounds, two empty cartridges, two additional magazines, eight large suitcases, four small suitcases, and a bucket containing approximately 360 kg of inflammable material have been recovered. It is suspected to be ammonium nitrate,” said Gupta.The police also recovered 20 timers with batteries, 24 remote controls, walkie-talkie sets, 5 kg of heavy metal, electronic wiring, and contraband materials. “It is not RDX... It is not an AK-47; it is an assault rifle. It is like an AK-47 but slightly smaller than it. But it is not AK-47,” Gupta clarified.Sources told The Times of India that the Faridabad raid followed crucial leads developed by Jammu and Kashmir Police during a separate investigation in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Dr Adil Ahmad Rather, arrested earlier in that operation, reportedly confessed to the presence of the explosive cache and identified his associate Dr Muzammil.Gupta confirmed, “Two accused persons have been booked until now, including Dr Muzsammil from Faridabad, and another accused, Aadil Rather, has been arrested from J&K’s Saharanpur.”Police sources said an AK-47 rifle was earlier recovered from Rather’s locker at the Government Medical College in Srinagar. The interrogation of Rather helped investigators trace the Faridabad apartment where the explosives were stored.In a related crackdown, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, as per an official statement, dismantled an inter-state and transnational terror module associated with proscribed organisations Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).According to the police statement, “The operation has led to the arrest of key operatives and the recovery of a massive cache of arms, ammunition, and explosives during coordinated searches in J&K and other states.”The recovered materials included 2,900 kg of IED-making material, consisting of chemicals, reagents, inflammable materials, and electronic components. Searches were conducted across Srinagar, Anantnag, Ganderbal, and Shopian, as well as in Faridabad and Saharanpur in coordination with local police.The statement said, “Financial investigations regarding the flow of funds are ongoing, and all linkages are being traced and addressed expeditiously.”Investigations revealed that the arrested individuals were part of a “white-collar terror ecosystem” that involved radicalised professionals, including doctors and academics, allegedly operating under instructions from foreign handlers in Pakistan.The J&K Police statement read, “The group has been using encrypted channels for indoctrination, coordination, fund movement, and logistics. Funds were raised through professional and academic networks under the guise of social and charitable causes.”The seven individuals arrested by J&K Police include Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, Molvi Irfan Ahmad, Zameer Ahmad Ahanger, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and Dr Adeel of Kulgam.Officials said that the network was working to identify potential recruits for radicalisation, raise funds, and arrange logistics for preparing improvised explosive devices (IEDs).“The accused were involved in identifying persons to radicalize, initiate, and recruit into terrorist ranks, besides raising funds, arranging logistics, and procuring arms, ammunition, and materials for preparing IEDs,” the police said.Investigators are currently tracing the flow of funds and communications to determine the extent of involvement of foreign handlers.The J&K Police confirmed the recovery of one Chinese Star pistol, one Beretta pistol, one AK-56 rifle, and a Krinkov rifle, along with a significant quantity of ammunition. The arms are believed to have been procured through smuggling routes facilitated by operatives based across the border.The police said that these recoveries, coupled with the seizure in Faridabad, “are a testimony to the diligent efforts and unflagging determination of the concerned team.”Former Jammu and Kashmir DGP SP Vaid, speaking to ANI, linked the Faridabad recovery to Pakistan’s “deep state.” He said, “I think they were planning a terror action in the interior of the country. That’s why this huge recovery of explosive material, ammonium nitrate or whatever it is, with an assault rifle in a joint operation by J&K and Faridabad police.”He added, “Pakistan’s deep state is desperate to take some major action in the hinterland. Looks like Pakistan and ISI are planning something big in India.”Warning Islamabad, Vaid remarked, “They should remember that Operation Sindoor is on, and if they undertake something, they will have to bear consequences for the complete annihilation of Pakistan.”Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.), also speaking to ANI, urged the government to adopt a “strong stand” against Pakistan. He said, “On October 27, Hezbollah Mujahideen Jaish-e-Mohammad posters were found in Srinagar. It was found that one Dr Adil Ahmed was the person who had put up those posters... His interrogation led to Dr Muzammil, who was in Faridabad in a rented accommodation. His house was raided. A huge cache of arms and 360 kg of ammonium nitrate was recovered. ”Gaur also warned that terrorism was no longer limited to the uneducated. “Whatever the politicians may say, because of no jobs, no work avenues, persecuted people are becoming terrorists, but these are educated people,” he said, adding that recent arrests in Gujarat also involved a doctor allegedly creating ricin, a deadly poison.He asserted, “India has to now take a very strong stand, as our Prime Minister had already said, that Operation Sindoor is ongoing... If anything happens, there will be repercussions.”Union Minister Giriraj Singh, in a comment to ANI, stirred controversy by linking the case to communal angles. “The Modi government and the State government caught it. However, this was even dangerous than the Mumbai blasts... But, whenever they are caught, it is always a person from one community... a Muslim doctor has been arrested,” Singh said.He criticised Opposition leaders for not reacting. “Be it Rahul Gandhi, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav or Asaduddin Owaisi, they would not issue a statement on this. This is condemnable, and people should worry about it. It is a shocking incident for the nation,” he said.A day before the Faridabad recovery, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested three suspects near the Adalaj Toll Plaza in an alleged conspiracy to execute terror strikes across India.According to a statement by the Gujarat ATS, “They had been on the radar for the past year and were arrested while supplying weapons.” The suspects were identified as Dr Ahmed Mohiuddin Syed, Mohd Suhel, and Azad, all accused of planning attacks in multiple states.The ATS recovered two Glock pistols, one Beretta pistol, 30 live cartridges, and 4 litres of castor oil from them.The agency has also launched a probe into their alleged foreign links. “The operation was conducted based on specific intelligence inputs and coordinated surveillance,” said Gujarat ATS DIG Sunil Joshi.The Jammu and Kashmir Police reiterated that the ongoing crackdown reflects the government’s zero-tolerance approach towards terrorism. “Operations against the terror support network will continue to ensure its complete dismantling,” the force said in an official statement.Central agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Intelligence Bureau (IB), are coordinating with local forces to identify cross-border funding routes, handlers, and logistical support systems used by the module.(With inputs from news agency ANI and PTI)","Jammu and Kashmir Police, in coordination with Haryana Police, on Monday uncovered a large cache of explosives and arms from an apartment in Faridabad. 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.

"Canal near Kartavya Path green with algae, pavements broken",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canal-near-kartavya-path-green-with-algae-pavements-broken/articleshow/125237476.cms,"/

NEW DELHI: Just a few metres away from the redeveloped Kartavya Path (earlier known as Rajpath) - a major component of the Central Vista project - sections of pavements lie broken, a canal that was refurbished has stagnant water, while several vehicles are stationed in a parking lot that has come up unauthorisedly.After the care bestowed upon the canal next to Kartavya Path police post, as part of the Kartavya Path project, which had made it look beautiful, it is now a portrait of bureaucratic apathy, with the water turning thick green with moss and algae due to lack of maintenance for weeks.These neglected patches are not tucked away in some forgotten corner. Every day, hundreds of govt employees, including senior officials from nearby buildings that house ministries, go past the stretch during their post-lunch walk. Yet, few appear to have raised the issue or alerted the agencies to set things right.TOI visited the sites near Kartavya Path on Thursday, only to find that pavement stretches along the Rafi Marg near Krishi Bhawan have remained damaged, posing risks to pedestrians and marring the aesthetics of one of Delhi's most prominent public spaces.The entire area falls under the jurisdiction of the housing and urban affairs ministry.When Kartavya Path was inaugurated, it had announced the installation of 60 aerators in canals to prevent stagnation and ensure clean oxygenated water. These systems were expected to keep the water clear and flowing, eliminating any chance of buildup of moss or algae.When contacted, ministry sources on Monday said 10 refurnished canals adjacent to Kartavya Path are being regularly cleaned by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). They added that CPWD had faced difficulty at only one canal as the cables connecting three aerators needed repairs. ""The aerator cables that are not functioning are likely to be repaired in the next two days. Meanwhile, the canal is being cleaned manually,"" one of them said.Another location between the canal (behind the police post) and Rail Bhawan has become a parking lot for dozens of vehicles. Sources said the area was used for some works during the construction of the new Parliament complex. But more than two years after the completion of the Parliament building, the area is yet to be restored.On the condition of footpaths on Rafi Marg along Krishi Bhawan and Vayu Bhawan, sources said these had to be dismantled to lay new underground electric cables for electric substations, to supply power to new Central Vista buildings. The work has been completed, and restoration of footpaths and the cleaning of debris will be done by Nov 13. The footpaths will be restored on a priority basis by Nov 25, they said.""This is another example of how maintenance gets less attention than new construction and development projects. For months now, the green areas and landscape near Krishi Bhawan have been neglected, and these are spruced up only ahead of Republic Day,"" said an official working at Krishi Bhawan.","A canal that was refurbished has stagnant water, while several vehicles are stationed in a parking lot that has come up unauthorisedly.

Data mismatch on dog bites raises question on health surveillance

NEW DELHI: Contrary to the Union government's claim in Parliament that no human rabies deaths occurred in Delhi between 2022 and 2024, information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act reveals a starkly different reality.According to records shared by Maharshi Valmiki Infectious Diseases (MVID) Hospital - the Capital's only dedicated infectious disease facility under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) - 18 people succumbed to rabies in the city during this three-year period.The RTI data shows six deaths in 2022, 2 in 2023, and 10 in 2024 at MVID Hospital in Kingsway Camp. These figures directly contradict the written reply submitted by minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying S P Singh Baghel in the Lok Sabha earlier this year, which stated that ""zero human rabies deaths"" were recorded in Delhi from January 2022 to January 2025.The Lok Sabha reply, however, did include data on animal bite cases reported in Delhi during this period - 6,691 cases in 2022, 17,874 in 2023, and 25,210 in 2024 - indicating a steady year-on-year rise in dog bite incidents even as human deaths were officially shown as nil.The sharp mismatch between central and local data on rabies deaths in Delhi has raised questions over coordination between health surveillance systems and the accuracy of reporting mechanisms for rabies, a disease that remains 100% preventable yet almost always fatal once symptoms appear.In Parliament, the minister said that under the National Rabies Control Programme, states compile monthly data on dog bites and rabies deaths and upload it to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme portal. This system, he noted, enhanced surveillance of rabies cases and animal bites nationwide. While Baghel was unavailable for comments and did not respond to text messages, his additional PS, Himashu Sharma, said that offhand they cannot comment on the issue of discrepancy in the data, if any, without seeking a proper response from the department.Under the National Action Plan for Dog-Mediated Rabies Elimination by 2030 - jointly launched in September 2021 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying - the National Centre for Disease Control implements the human health component, while the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying oversees the animal health aspect.The plan emphasises mass dog vaccination, sterilisation, and ensuring uninterrupted availability of anti-rabies vaccine and anti-rabies serum/rabies immunoglobulin at govt facilities. These are provided free of cost under the National Free Drug Initiative of the National Health Mission and are part of the essential drug lists of all states.","Data mismatch on dog bites raises question on health surveillance systems.

JLN rebuild could be inspired by Qatar's famed Sports City

NEW DELHI: Delhi's iconic sports venue, Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium, which was originally built for the 1982 Asian Games and later refurbished at a cost of over Rs 900 crore ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, will likely be demolished and undergo a major makeover, according to sports ministry officials.The ministry is considering plans to redevelop the venue into a sprawling sports city in coming years, catering to all major disciplines, including a lodging facility for athletes, officials said on Monday.The Union govt plans to overhaul the 102-acre JLN stadium complex into a state-of-the-art, multi-discipline premier facility equipped with world-class infrastructure for both training purposes and hosting major sporting events.""The planning is in the proposal stage. Other ministries, including the urban development ministry, need to be consulted as well. The timeline for the project and the estimated cost has not yet been worked out. But it's been decided to dismantle and redevelop the JLN stadium into a premier sports city,"" officials said.Officials told TOI that the proposed sports city would be modelled on Qatar's Sports City, also known as Aspire Zone, in the Baaya district of Al Rayyan, which is located near Doha. It was built in 2003 at a cost running into billions of dollars. The facility was central to Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and forms a key part of its ambitions to host the Olympics in 2036. Last week, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya and his team attended the second World Summit for Social Development in Qatar.It has been learnt that the minister visited the Sports City and was left impressed with the facilities. Mandaviya even enquired at length about the project development from the Qatari sports officials.According to ministry sources, a delegation from Qatar would soon visit Delhi to assess the viability of the JLN redevelopment project and prepare a roadmap for Indian authorities. The ministry would also study two other key sports infrastructure for JLN stadium redevelopment - Australia's Docklands stadium in Melbourne that can host cricket, Australian Rules football, rugby, cricket and soccer, and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave closer home in Ahmedabad, which is spread across 650 acres and includes the Narendra Modi stadium and multiple Olympic-standard facilities. The project cost the Gujarat govt Rs 5,050 cr.""All offices inside the stadium, including some of the ministry's departments like Sports Authority of India (SAI), National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada), National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL), and Income Tax department will be relocated as and when the project takes off. Currently, over 100 acres of land that it occupies is not being used to its optimal level. Only 28 percent has been utilised,"" officials said.JLN stadium, with a seating capacity of 60,000, hosted several prestigious international events, including the Delhi CWG 2010 and U17 FIFA World Cup in 2017. It recently received a major renovation for the World Para Athletics Championships, which saw the participation of over 2,200 athletes globally from 104 nations.A new blue-coloured, nine-lane Mondo synthetic track was installed at both the main ground and warm-up area for an approximate cost of Rs 25 cr, while the total stadium refurbishment cost was around Rs 80 crore.The facility is primarily used for athletics events and football matches and has an archery, badminton and table tennis academy."," Delhi's iconic sports venue, Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium, will likely be demolished and undergo a major makeover. The ministry is considering plans to redevelop the venue into a sprawling sports city.

Supreme Court to seek government clarity on census, delimitation process

NEW DELHI: Observing that 33% reservation for women in legislative bodies is meant to bring social, economic and political justice for ""the largest minority of the country"" that is women, Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a plea seeking immediate implementation of quota for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, instead of waiting for delimitation after the next census as required by the 106th Constitutional Amendment Act.Though a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan expressed its reluctance to entertain the petition, it finally agreed to examine it after senior advocate Shobha Gupta pleaded that the court should ask the Centre to brief when it intended to conduct census and thereafter delimitation exercise.Gupta submitted that the constitutional amendment cannot be put on hold for an indefinite period.""The constitutional amendment cannot be put on hold for an uncertain period. In fact, a special session of Parliament was called for implementing the reservation in Parliament as well as in the state legislatures, and both houses passed this bill unanimously and honourable President of India also gave assent and thereafter Act was notified on Sept 28, 2023. But it is not being implemented. There is no reason to wait for the delimitation process and the reservation can be done for women by rotating the reserved seats,"" Gupta said.Hailing the constitutional amendment, Justice Nagaathna said that women constituted the largest minority in the country and it would bring justice to them.The judge also highlighted that women's representation in legislative bodies was decreasing and raised questions on why the political parties were not giving tickets to women candidates.The court was hearing a plea filed by a Congress memmer from Madhya Pradesh, Jaya Thakur.The bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said that it could not ask the Centre to implement the law (immediate implementation of 33% reservation for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies) as it was in the domain of govt but agreed to issue notice to Centre to know when the process of census and delimitation would be done to pave the way for implementation of the law.The petition filed by advocate Varun Thakur said that several constitutional amendments on reservations were implemented immediately without being tied to the completion of any census or delimitation exercise and the same should be applied for women's reservation.It said that the hindrance defeats the objective of ensuring adequate representation of women in the democratic process as women held only 4% of seats in legislative bodies while their population is nearly 50%.",Supreme Court agrees to hear a plea seeking immediate implementation of quota for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.

‘Never Heard Such an Explosion’: Locals Recall Shock and Panic After Delhi Blast

NEW DELHI: A deafening noise, car parts tossed into the air, and several bodies strewn across - eyewitnesses who found themselves near the spot of Monday evening's blast outside Red Fort metro station recalled scenes of complete chaos, destruction and trauma.The force of the explosion was immense, felt far and wide. The window at Gate No. 1 metro station - on the opposite side of the road - was completely shattered. Within seconds, debris was scattered everywhere, and fear and panic set in.""I heard the voice 300 metres away, behind Lala Lajpat Rai Market. We came out and saw people running,"" said Vinod Kumar (40), a coolie in Bhagirath Palace. ""I have never heard such a loud blast ever in my life. I fell three times due to the explosion. It felt as if we were all going to die...,"" recalled a local shopkeeper.At the site, slippers and shoes were seen lying in several places, left by the hundreds who ran for their lives - rushing off in different directions and into the closest lane they could find. Some vehicles passing by near Gate No. 4 metro station were left abandoned mid-road by drivers who feared another explosion.Jamna, a 50-year-old woman, stood crying near the barricade, frantically looking for her son Arjun. Disoriented and trembling, she said, ""He sells flowers in a nearby market... I can't find him now...""Police cordoned off the area and set up barricades. Shopkeepers, who had moments earlier been going about their day, were seen searching for their vehicles or trying to reach their loved ones to make sure they were safe.Akshay (41), a business man whose electronics shop was just 200 metres away, said, ""No one could figure out what happened. Several cars were damaged. It felt like the ground was shaking. People said it was a CNG blast, but it felt like something else...""Amid the chaos, there were also good Samaritans like Chander Prakash and his friend Abhijeet Singh, who sprang into action to help the injured. ""We were near the temple when we heard two loud blasts,"" Prakash recalled, his voice shaking. ""Suddenly, there was mayhem - people screaming, fireballs everywhere and debris flying in all directions. We rushed to assist the injured, lifting them and helping carry them into ambulances. ""Jai (49), a watch shop owner travelling from Lala Lajpat Rai Market towards Kashmere Gate, had a close shave as he was just 10 metres from the spot. ""I parked my scooty some distance away due to the rush and took an e-rickshaw with two others. Within a minute, I heard a noise so loud my ears got blocked. Then I saw car parts flying and scattered body parts,"" Jai said.Maujib (24), who was at a nearby traffic signal, recalled the panic: ""There was a huge crowd, and the moment we heard a loud noise, everyone just scrambled and ran for their lives.""Hours later, the usually crowded area with barely any space to walk stood eerily empty under the flashing lights of police and emergency teams.(With inputs from Kushagra Singh)","Witnesses who found themselves near the spot of Monday evening's blast outside Red Fort metro station recalled scenes of complete chaos, destruction and trauma.

Massive Car Explosion Near Delhi’s Red Fort Hours After Faridabad Terror Plot bust, Many Dead

4 toll plazas in NCR among 10 in country that see most FASTag use

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were killed and 30 others injured following a high-intensity explosion in a car near Red Fort in Old Delhi on Monday evening. The powerful blast also set at least three other vehicles moving alongside ablaze. The impact of the blast was such that human body parts along with parts of vehicles were found flung across a 20-25-metre radius.Massive flames and thick smoke engulfed the area before police and fire teams contained the situation. Apart from the occupants of the car, a Gurgaon number plate i20 hatchback, passersby were also killed in the explosion.A forensic report is awaited on the nature of the blast and the ensuing fire to confirm a terror angle, cops said. If it is indeed terror-related, this would be the first such blast in Delhi in 14 years, the last being in 2011 at the high court.Police commissioner Satish Golcha said it was around 6.52pm that a slow-moving vehicle stopped at the traffic signal. ""An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to it, nearby vehicles were also damaged. Some people died, and some were injured in the incident,"" he said.Late evening, police said the vehicle was registered in the name of a Gurgaon resident, Salman, but it was sold to someone.Cops said the ID of the current owner had the name Tariq, from Pulwama.Home minister Amit Shah also spoke with the Intelligence Bureau chief. The situation is being closely monitored. ""The home minister has also called us, and information is being shared with him from time to time,"" Golcha added.Fire officials said they received an SOS call around 6.55pm about ""some type of blast in a car and vehicle fire"". Seven fire tenders were sent to the spot. Soon, police and special cell also rushed. However, as the casualties and the scale of the blast was confirmed, NSG, NIA and other agencies were also pressed into service.Four toll plazas in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) - Kherki Daula on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Mundka on UER-II, Chhajarsi in Ghaziabad and Bagan in Sonipat - are among the top 10 locations on the National Highways network in the country with the highest use of the FASTag annual pass by private vehicle owners.Sources said that at some plazas, such as Kherki Daula, the share of transactions happening through the annual pass exceeds 50%. This reflects how the FASTag annual pass has become one of the most popular and preferred modes of toll payment, an official said.So far, over 32 lakh private vehicle owners have opted for the annual pass, which is both convenient and economical.Officials said that a similar trend is expected among vehicle owners using the Dwarka Expressway, as many officegoers commuting to Gurugram and Manesar are likely to prefer the tolling mode to cut expenses and save time. For such users, the total toll for a one-way trip through Bijwasan and Kherki Daula will be barely Rs 30.The annual pass, which costs Rs 3,000, allows commuters to cross 200 plazas and can be renewed multiple times a year. ""Since the renewal process through NHAI's Rajyamarg App is seamless, it has become very convenient for vehicle users,"" an official said, adding that the FASTag annual pass has also boosted the popularity of the app - a single-window platform offering information and services related to NHAI-managed highways.He added that greater use of the App by commuters will help NHAI get more insights into commuting patterns and high load stretches for future planning and expansion.",Four toll plazas in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) among 10 in country that see most FASTag use.

Univ stir turns into assertion of identity, administrative claim

CHANDIGARH: The Panjab University Senate issue, believed to have been resolved after the Centre's quick U-turn on its plans to restructure the body, erupted on Monday in a campus turmoil not seen in decades.What was a students' call for a campus shutdown to demand quick senate elections turned into an overwhelming show of strength by thousands of protesters of all hues - farmer organisations, Panthic outfits, social groups and the All-India Sikh Students Federation .They smashed police barricades and two locked gates, clashed with Chandigarh Police and stormed into the campus in organised groups.By afternoon, over 5,000 people were in the university - including a young Nihang atop a horse holding up a sword as he rode past the VC's office. The student demonstration had transformed into a politically driven incursion.This stopped being about the senate today. It became a political mobilisation by external elements. Panjab University should not be used as a platform for such political agendas. This institution cannot be turned into a theatre for power contests from outside. I urge all groups to respect the academic character of this university,"" VC Renu Vig said.PU had declared Monday and Tuesday holidays in view of the shutdown call. PU authorities have already submitted the senate poll schedule to vice-president C P Radhakrishnan, who is chancellor of the university, for approval, but it did nothing to stop the protests.The face-off started around midnight when groups of protesters from outside gathered along with students before the locked gates and raised slogans. A tense face-off with police ensued, and Chandigarh SSP Kanwardeep Kaur intervened to ease tensions.Before daybreak, Chandigarh police started setting up barricades at the entry points to screen vehicles coming from Punjab. But groups of protesters did get through and began massing in front of PU gates where 2,000 cops stood guard.Slogans for PU's autonomy were replaced with ""Panjab University Punjab Di"" and ""Chandigarh Punjab Da (PU and Chandigarh belong to Punjab)"". And speeches increasingly referenced the university's historic link to Punjab and the political debate around Chandigarh's control.The senate-centric protest turned into an assertion of identity and administrative claim. By university estimates, not more than 500 of those inside were PU students.SSP Kanwardeep Kaur was present when police resorted to a brief lathicharge and detained several people.Former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Congress MLA Pargat Singh, Anandpur Sahib AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang, AAP MLA Sukhanand and NSUI Punjab chief Isherpreet Sidhu also joined in the protest.","Thousands of protesters of all hues stormed into the campus in organised groups.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: The 30th session of the annual UN climate conference (COP30) kicked off on Monday in Belem, Brazil, with a focus on climate finance to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035. Discussions on the inaugural day, however, were centred around setting key agenda points, involving five critical issues, for negotiations.The presidencies of this year’s host Brazil and last year’s host Azerbaijan had last week released the ‘Baku to Belém Roadmap’, detailing how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries to help them implement promised climate actions. Though not a formal conference document, the Roadmap set the tone for brainstorming the issue during the upcoming negotiations.With countries gearing up to discuss contentious issues, including climate finance, UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell, while opening the COP30, said, ""Your job here is not to fight one another – your job is to fight this climate crisis, together.""Besides the critical issues of ways and means of mobilising climate finance and the countries’ response to the latest round of climate action pledges (Nationally Determined Contributions) to limit the warming to 1.5 degree Celsius, the setting of agenda on the first day revolved around three more issues, including a request to discuss unilateral trade measures such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the EU-backed proposal on emissions reporting.The CBAM, which is to be implemented from next year, will impose border tax on carbon intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 European Union nations.

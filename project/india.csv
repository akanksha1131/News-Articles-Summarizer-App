NEW DELHI: The Republic Day parade this year will have more cultural elements, though its basic military character will be retained, with the new indigenous Pralay missile being among the wide array of weapon systems to be showcased.“The military and martial character of the parade is being maintained, but we want to make it a broader societal-cultural programme, with wider participation from our society, both in terms of the performers and the invitees,” defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said on Monday.With Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto being the chief guest at the 90-minute parade down the majestic Kartavya Path on Jan 26, a marching contingent and band from the country will also take part in the annual celebration. In all, there will be 18 marching contingents, 15 bands and 31 tableaux.The parade, with the theme “Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas”, will be “heralded” by 300 cultural artistes with Indian musical instruments. It will also witness a performance by 5,000 folk and tribal artistes that will cover the entire Kartavya Path from one end to the other.Around 10,000 “special guests” have been invited to the parade this year to ensure “Jan Bhagidari”, which include “best performers” in various fields and those “who have made the best use” of various govt schemes.India’s two main indigenous aviation showpieces, Tejas fighter jets and Dhruv advanced light helicopters (ALHs), however, will not be part of the Republic Day fly-past this year, as was earlier reported by TOI.“The grounding of the ALH fleet (there are 330 such choppers in the armed forces) is a slight setback. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is currently conducting safety checks, and it will be sorted out soon. However, it is unlikely the fleet will return to action in time for the parade,” Singh said.","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be the chief guest at the 90-minute parade.

No closure: ‘Reclaim the Night’ protesters on RG Kar ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-closure-reclaim-the-night-protesters-on-rg-kar-ruling/articleshow/117410944.cms,"File photo

KOLKATA: How can’t a PGT doctor’s rape and murder inside a hospital be considered a rarest of rare crime, asked the medical fraternity here, which had carried out a movement for almost two months, demanding justice for the RG Kar victim.Doctors said that given the Kolkaka court’s verdict, they already knew convict Sanjay Roy would either be sentenced to death or life imprisonment but what disheartened them was that a crime, which had evoked spontaneous protests across the globe, was termed “not rarest of rare”.“With due respect to the court’s decision, it is disheartening this case has been termed ‘not rarest of rare’. The death penalty can be appealed in a higher court. Even Supreme Court took up the case suo motu. How can’t this case be rarest of rare?” Tapas Pramanick, emergency medical officer of RG Kar Medical College, said.For him, Roy’s conviction brought about “only a partial closure”. “Till the other influential people involved are arrested, we will continue the agitation and keep up the pressure on CBI and the administration,” he said.Meanwhile, many of the protesters who had taken to streets after the crime, said they would not get a closure till the other perpetrators were brought to justice.“We expect the judiciary to keep this case under active supervision to identify every single culprit responsible for the heinous crime. Legal intervention is an important side of redress but not enough. We also need actionable social change, along with policy-level changes, and that is a long-term struggle,” Rimjhim Sinha, the first one who had called for the ‘Reclaim the Night’ movement on Aug 14 last year.","PGT doctor's rape and murder inside a hospital evoked spontaneous protests across the globe.

The court emphasised on ‘reform’ rather than ‘retribution’ in the verdict

KOLKATA: Kolkata court judge Anirban Das’s emphasis on “reform” rather than “retribution” in sentencing RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape-and-murder convict Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment, instead of awarding him death penalty, received support from experts and advocacy groups.“The measure of a civilised society lies not in its ability to exact revenge but in its capacity to reform, rehabilitate, and ultimately to heal,” the judge stated.“We are in agreement with the trial court judgment. Benefit of doubt needs to be given to the accused. In this case, there’s a lot of doubt. We do not want to say that he (Sanjay Roy) is innocent. But capital punishment is of no good,” Ranjit Sur, general secretary of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), said.The belief that the death penalty acts as a greater deterrent than life imprisonment is unfounded, Sur added.Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who was the first counsel to fight the case of the victim’s parents at Calcutta HC, also agreed with the trial court judge’s decision to award life sentence. “He took the right step by not pronouncing death penalty. There should be no death penalty. The judge gave this verdict after examining all the evidence,” Bhattacharya said.Judge Das, referring to the landmark Bachan Singh case which established the guideline for imposing death penalty, stated, “It is evident that this case does not meet the stringent criteria for being classified as ‘rarest of the rare’. Supreme Court has consistently emphasised that death penalty should be used only in exceptional circumstances where the collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it expects the holders of judicial power to inflict the death penalty.”Advocate Phiroze Edulji, who represented the convicts in the 2013 Kamduni gang rape and murder case, said: “I am against death penalty. Which murder is not heinous? It’s all about public perception. Rarest of rare cases where the death penalty is given depends on the judge concerned.”Monday’s judgment also stated: “When considering the imposition of capital punishment, courts must grapple with a complex web of legal, moral, and societal considerations. The principle of proportionality is paramount — the punishment must fit the crime. In cases of extreme brutality and cruelty, where the offence shocks the conscience of society, the argument for the ultimate punishment gains strength. However, this must be balanced against the principles of reformative justice and the sanctity of human life.”","Kolkata court judge Anirban Das’s emphasis on ‘reform’ rather than ‘retribution’ in sentencing rape-and-murder convict Sanjay Roy received support from experts and advocacy groups. “The measure of a civilised society lies not in its ability to exact revenge but in its capacity to reform, rehabilitate, and ultimately to heal,” the judge stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117410932,imgsize-723694,width-400,resizemode-4/117410932.jpg"

KOLKATA: The Sealdah sessions court criticised Kolkata police, particularly officers from Tala police station , for their “mishandling” of the investigation into the rape and murder of a resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College in Aug last year.Judge Anirban Das highlighted Monday in his judgment several lapses and directed the police commissioner to address the “illegal acts” of his officers.“I am of the view that if the officers of Tala PS took proper initiative by applying their intellect at the very first time, the matter would not become so complicated,” the judgment reads, pointing to the failure of police to act promptly and effectively.The court also urged the police commissioner to be “strict” about the “indifferent attitude” of the officers and called for better training to prevent such negligence in the future.SI Subrata Chatterjee at Tala police station was among those hauled up for the way the general diary (GD) was filed. “This evidence of one SI (Chatterjee) is an eye-opener that police stations are treating the cases in a very indifferent manner. I condemn such acts of SI Subrata Chatterjee,” the judgment reads.The court also questioned the delay in allowing the victim’s parents to lodge a complaint, criticising police for keeping them waiting until 6pm although the body was found the morning on Aug 9.ASI Anup Dutta, under whose supervision the civic volunteer Sanjay Roy was working, was reprimanded for his role in the case. Kolkata police arrested Roy on Aug 10, CBI assumed charge of the case three days later, and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday.An additional officer-in-charge (OC) was called out for mishandling crucial evidence, particularly for taking the victim’s mobile from Roy on Aug 9 and leaving it unattended at Tala police station. “Her action… is a very curious one,” the judgment reads.","Sealdah sessions court criticises Kolkata police, particularly officers from Tala police station.

What do we know about the alleged attacker

Shehzad is a 31-year-old native of Jhalokati district, Bangladesh.

He entered India illegally and adopted multiple identities, including ""Vijay Das.""

He worked in Mumbai for five to six months, employed by a housekeeping agency.

Shehzad allegedly planned the theft but was unaware it was Saif Ali Khan’s residence.

Police have seized evidence suggesting his Bangladeshi origin and are verifying his criminal history.

He was nabbed in Thane.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A. No proper investigation has been done,"" he said","Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

On January 29, 2025, we are going to welcome the year of wood snake.

Additionally, snakes are linked to longevity, fertility, prosperity, and good fortune. Snakes are regarded as protectors of holy sites and divine messengers in certain traditions. Snakes are also admired for their capacity to regenerate and shed their skin, which represents metamorphosis and rebirth.People who are strategic, patient, and open to the Snake's knowledge will discover that they can prosper by adjusting to a slower pace in all facets of life. The Year of the Snake is associated with those who are logical, composed, considerate, and devoted to their loved ones.2025 will be a year of gradual advancement for the Rat. Although it will take time to grow in your career, you can make significant progress by concentrating on strategic planning. Patience is essential; prudent money management will pay off in the long run. Since some relationships can feel shaky at times, communication will be crucial to building stronger ties. In terms of health, striking a balance between work and personal obligations is essential to lowering stress and preserving general wellbeing.In 2025, Oxen can anticipate a successful year in which their commitment and diligence will be rewarded with accolades or promotions. This is a period when efforts will be rewarded since the Snake's steady character complements the Ox's methodical approach. Safe investments will help you save more money and safeguard your assets. This year presents more harmonious dynamics in partnerships, with the possibility of creating stronger, more enduring bonds. In terms of health, Oxen will typically feel balanced and powerful, but it's crucial to avoid overworking.2025 might be a difficult year for Tigers, particularly in terms of job advancement. The Snake's more measured energy clashes with the Tiger's impetuous impulses, which could result in setbacks if impatience takes over. Instead of moving too quickly, now is an excellent moment be slow and being cautious. A cautious approach will be most advantageous financially because taking risks could result in unintended losses. Relationships may experience some upheaval this year.The Year of the Snake offers Rabbits the chance to advance in their careers, especially if they are prepared to continue being adaptable and cooperative. Financial prudence is encouraged, though; prioritize security over hazardous endeavors because safer investments eventually generate higher returns. Rabbits will probably see improvements and cultivate deep bonds with the people they love.Dragons have a bright future in the Year of the Snake, but it will need perseverance and proper preparation. Dragons should grow financially, but prudence is encouraged. Steer clear of rash financial decisions; seeking expert advice before making significant investments will guarantee stability. Dragons will look for chances to strengthen emotional bonds in interpersonal relationships.As this is the Snake’s year, those born under this sign are in for a period of empowerment and transformation. Career-wise, 2025 could bring breakthroughs, especially for Snakes, who are diligent and strategic in their approach. Long-term financial prospects appear strong, but it’s wise to avoid high-risk investments in favour of steady, stable gains.For Horses, the Year of the Snake could feel like a time for introspection and reevaluation, especially with relation to professional objectives. Although progress may seem gradual, proper planning and skill development are possible throughout this period. Horses should prioritize stability and steer clear of needless risks in their finances. Setbacks could result from careless spending or speculative investments.In 2025, goats can anticipate a prosperous year for professional growth, with consistent advancement probably coming from cooperation and teamwork. For long-term financial planning, this year is perfect. Close ties with loved ones will grow stronger at this time, thus relationships will probably provide consolation and support.The Year of the Snake could be difficult for monkeys, especially if they are in the middle of their career. Overcoming challenges will require adaptability and innovative problem-solving techniques. Even if there may be challenges in the future, Monkeys can overcome obstacles in their profession by remaining flexible. There may be tense times in relationships, and addressing disagreements will require open communication.If Roosters continue to be organized and thorough in their approach, 2025 will present numerous prospects for career progress. Roosters' innate attention to detail will help them achieve professional goals, and leadership roles may arise. Roosters will have the opportunity to fortify interpersonal bonds in partnerships this year, particularly if they emphasize loyalty and trust.Dogs are advised to exercise caution and thoughtfulness when choosing a career during the Year of the Snake. Careful preparation will pay off in the long run, even though development can be gradual rather than quick. To achieve your goals, you will need to be patient. It's crucial to use prudence when making financial decisions. Stability can be preserved by taking a cautious stance and refraining from making snap decisions.In 2025, pigs can encounter career challenges that call for perseverance and patience. Making quick decisions could result in expensive errors, and career advancement could be slower than intended. Pigs should put budgeting and saving first when it comes to money. It's crucial to exercise caution when spending because of possible financial difficulties.","The Year of the Snake is associated with those who are logical, composed, considerate, and devoted to their loved ones.

NEW DELHI: A legal battle over imposing a ban on manufacture, sale and distribution of food products with halal certification has intensified with the Centre on Monday telling the court that few lakhs of crores of rupees were being collected by giving certification for various products including cement, iron bars, bottles and this pushed prices of products higher.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih that he was shocked to know that ‘Halal’ certification is not confined to food items but it was done for all sorts of products. “So far as Halal meat etc. is concerned, nobody can have any objection. But your Lordships would be shocked, as I was shocked yesterday, even cement used is to be halal-certified! Sariyas (iron bars) used have to be halal-certified...Water bottles which we get are required to be halal-certified...Few lakhs of crores are collected through certification,” the SG said.His plea was opposed by senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for various petitioners including Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind Halal Trust , and told the bench that concept of Halal has been well explained in central govt policy and it is a matter of lifestyle. He said that everything is voluntary and no one is forced to have Halal-certified products.Food Security and Drug Administration of UP govt had in Nov 2023 banned the “manufacture, sale, storage and distribution of halal-certified products with immediate effect”. “In compliance with Section 30(2)(d) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, in exercise of the authority vested in Section 30(2)(a) of the said Act, in view of public health, food with Halal certification is being banned within the limits of Uttar Pradesh ,” the notification said.The solicitor general submitted that the issue has to be adjudicated by the apex court while highlighting that price of product increases due to halal certification and it affected consumers. The court was hearing a plea challenging UP government notification.UP govt in its affidavit said the ‘halal’ certification of food products acts as a parallel system that creates confusion regarding the quality and is completely against the basic intention of the Food Safety and Standards Act.The court posted the hearing to March 25.","The Centre told the court that few lakhs of crores of rupees were being collected by giving certification for various products including cement, iron bars, bottles.

Makes no sense to arrest after filing chargesheet: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/makes-no-sense-to-arrest-after-filing-chargesheet-supreme-court/articleshow/117408296.cms,"Supreme Court

Merely because an arrest can be made because it’s lawful doesn’t mean it should be done: SC said

NEW DELHI: Despite the Supreme Court passing several directives to restrain investigating agencies from arresting an accused in a routine manner, particularly when it’s not needed, they had very little impact on ground. The apex court has now come to know that there is an unusual practice in Uttar Pradesh that the arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed, which the court said ""makes no sense"".A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan stated that there is no point in arresting a person once the investigation in the case is complete.We are of the view that once the investigation is over and a chargesheet is filed, the accused should be asked to appear before the court concerned and granted bail to the satisfaction of the trial court. If the investigating officer wants to interrogate the petitioner, the person can be arrested during the course of the investigation itself. At this stage, there is no point in making a formal arrest,” the bench said while granting bail to an accused who expressed apprehension of being arrested.The court was informed that there is a practice in UP that arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed and the court takes cognizance of the chargesheet. “We do not propose to say anything as regards in this unusual practice except that it makes no sense,” the bench said.The court decried such practice in various orders, including in case of Siddharth vs State of UP. “The trial courts are stated to be insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the chargesheet on record in view of the provisions of Section 170 of the CrPC. We consider such a course misplaced and contrary to the very intent of Section 170 of CrPC... In the present case, when the appellant has joined the investigation, investigation has completed and he has been roped in after seven years of registration of the FIR we can think of no reason why at this stage he must be arrested before the chargesheet is taken on record,” the court had said in its 2021 order.“We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made.“...”If the accused has cooperated with the investigation and there’s no reason to believe they’ll abscond or disobey summons, there should be no compulsion for arrest,” it had said.","There is an unusual practice in Uttar Pradesh that the arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed.

SAMBHAJINAGAR: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday reiterated his party’s commitment to secularism and progressive politics, and issued a stern warning against divisive tactics and corruption. He also urged Ladki Bahin beneficiaries earning an annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh and above to voluntarily opt out of the scheme.“Maharashtra has always been a beacon of progressive thought and social harmony. NCP stands firmly for unity and secularism. We will not allow anyone to spread hatred or indulge in divisive politics,” Pawar said, while speaking at the inauguration of NCP’s district office in Jalna.He urged party workers to ensure transparency while inducting new members, and “avoid admitting individuals with a tainted image”.While claiming that state government had allocated Rs 3,700 crore to WCD department for Ladki Bahin Yojana, fulfilling its poll promise, the deputy CM appealed to the ineligible beneficiaries to voluntarily give up the benefits. “This scheme is meant for economically disadvantaged women. Unfortunately, even women who file income tax are availing themselves of its benefits. I request them to step back so that the aid can reach the people in need,” Pawar said, adding that eligible women would start receiving their monthly Rs 1,500 allowances by Jan 26.Pawar took a swipe at opposition parties for their campaign against EVMs. “When they win elections in other states like Karnataka and West Bengal, they praise EVMs. But when they lose, they blame the same machines,” he said.","Ajit Pawar urged Ladki Bahin beneficiaries earning an annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh and above to voluntarily opt out of the scheme.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Neyyattinkara sessions court sentenced Monday 24-year-old Greeshma SS to death for murdering her boyfriend, Sharon Raj, in Oct 2022. Judge AM Basheer, who termed the crime “rarest of the rare”, also fined her Rs 2 lakh. Greeshma is the second, and youngest, woman in Kerala to be awarded capital punishment, and the 40th convict on death row in the state. She can pproach HC to challenge the sentence.Greeshma was found guilty of luring Sharon, 23, to drink a pesticide-laced ayurvedic concoction that led to multiple organ failure and, eventually, death. Her maternal uncle, Nirmalakumaran Nair (60), was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for his role in the conspiracy. Her mother, Sindhu, was acquitted last week for lack of evidence.According to the verdict, Greeshma meticulously planned the murder after Sharon refused to end their relationship, which she claimed was causing problems in her life. The premeditation, combined with her attempt to mislead investigators, underscored the gravity of the crime. The court said the prosecution relied on circumstantial, digital and scientific evidence in the case. There were 48 pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused.The court sentenced Greeshma to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh under IPC Section 364 (kidnapping in order to murder), five years and a fine of Rs 50,000 under Sec 328 (causing harm using poison), and two years under Sec 203 (destruction of evidence or providing false information to protect an offender from legal punishment).Special public prosecutor Vineeth Kumar said Greeshma wanted to end her relationship with Sharon after her family fixed her marriage to an Army man. She later conspired with her uncle and mother to kill Sharon.","Greeshma SS sentenced to death for murdering her boyfriend, Sharon Raj, in Oct 2022.

BHOPAL: The third batch of 18 cheetahs, scheduled to be relocated from South Africa to Madhya Pradesh in Feb 2025, may take more time. Sources indicate that South Africa is awaiting quarterly progress reports on Project Cheetah, which are supposed to be sent by India’s ministry of environment, forest, and climate change as part of the MoU signed between the two countries.An officer associated with the project, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that the next batch would come once SA govt receives quarterly reports. The MoU, signed Jan 17, 2022, specifies that India’s govt must submit quarterly progress reports on the cheetahs translocated to India from South Africa.The project is also stalled due to pending import permission from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). These cheetahs are expected to be relocated to Kuno National Park in Sheopur and Gandhi Sagar in Mandsaur, but the delay in CITES approval is preventing the next phase of the reintroduction effort. Cheetahs, which were last found in India in the 1950s, are included in CITES Appendix I, which heavily regulates their trade to protect them from illegal international trade and over-exploitation.Once import permission by CITES is granted, South African authorities will need to secure export permission from the body before the translocation can proceed. Authorities have reportedly overlooked the need for CITES consent during the planning stages of the project, further complicating the process.Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with fewer than 7,000 individuals remaining in the wild, primarily in the savannahs of Africa. While southern Africa is considered the species’ stronghold, populations in north and west Africa are critically endangered. In Iran, a small population of Asiatic cheetahs also faces the threat of extinction.In 2019, SC approved the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s proposal to reintroduce African cheetahs to India’s national parks, with Kuno National Park in MP selected as the relocation site. The Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia had pledged to donate cheetahs for the project, with the only funding required being for transportation costs.",The project is also stalled due to pending import permission from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117407771,imgsize-134114,width-400,resizemode-4/117407771.jpg"

PRAYAGRAJ: Model-influencer Harsha Richaria’s participation in the Shahi Snan at Prayagraj Maha Kumbh has become a bone of contention among seers.After Shambhavi Peethadheeshwar Swami Anand Swaroop ’s objections to her participation in the first Amrit Snan on Makar Sankranti, Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Mahant Ravindra Puri has announced that he would take Harsha to Sangam in the chariot of Niranjani Akhara on Jan 29, the second Amrit Snan.“She is our daughter and the pride of Uttarakhand. I told her that she’ll be taking the holy dip on Mauni Amavasya sitting on a chariot in a full royal and grand manner, and she will bathe like a ‘devi’. I requested her to stay back and complete her stay at Kumbh,” said Puri.Not everyone is pleased with the attention being showered on the influencer. Swami Anand Swaroop urged Mahant Puri to reconsider the decision, citing his responsibility to protect Sanatan Dharma as ABAP president. “My view is very simple: a model should not and cannot take part in the Amrit Snan along with other seers just because she has worn bhagwa ( saffron ). It is disrespectful to the seer community, and we will certainly stop this from happening. Ab aar paar ho hi jaaye (Now, it should be settled once and for all),” said Anand Swaroop, chief of Kali Sena , while talking to TOI.Richaria, on her part, told the media: “I have come home to my Maharaj ji. If he is blessing me, I don’t need any other person’s support. If a daughter gets the support of her father, what else does she need? As I said earlier, I am here to learn about Sanatan Dharma to get connected with it, so that I can spread awareness in society.”Richaria grabbed attention at Maha Kumbh as she moved on a chariot on the day of the first Amrit Snan (Jan 14). Her videos and photos went viral on social media platforms, making her an instant sensation, with some followers referring to her as the “most beautiful sadhvi”.However, the kind of attention she has been getting has met with disapproval from a section of ascetics.

KARWAR: In a horrific case of animal cruelty, a pregnant cow was beheaded, its legs cut off and body ripped open and the unborn calf taken out, only to be mutilated, at Salkod village in Honnavar taluk of Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada district Sunday.This comes close on the heels of udders of three cows being severed in Bengaluru and chopping off a cow’s tail at Nanjangud in Mysuru.The cow belonged to one Krishna Achari, who lodged a police complaint saying the animal was killed between Jan 18 and 19 while grazing outside the village. When Krishna went searching for the cow, he found its dismembered head and legs, and the calf’s mutilated body. He said he had owned the cow for 10 years, and considered it a family member.Police registered a case against unknown persons under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act . Cops are probing if the cow was killed for meat or to instigate trouble in the district.Several bovine killings reported in nearby villages in the district have been attributed to leopard attacks. However, the brutality of Sunday’s attack left local residents shocked and shaken.Local BJP MLA Dinakar Shetty called for swift arrest of the perpetrators. BJP state president B Y Vijayendra and other party functionaries, too, condemned the latest attack on cows and targeted the Siddaramaiah govt, accusing it of having “a soft corner” for such elements.State home minister G Parameshwara has ordered an inquiry into the incident. “We have to find a solution to this. This morning, I gave instructions that we have to take this seriously and we have to identify people who have such a mindset,” he said.On the night of Jan 11, the udders of three cows were mutilated in Bengaluru’s Chamarajpet. Police had arrested a migrant worker from Bihar, Sheikh Nasru, and had claimed he attacked the cows under the influence of alcohol, and he appeared to be mentally unstable. Locals had, however, disputed the police claims.","Pregnant cow was beheaded, its legs cut off and body ripped open and the unborn calf taken out, only to be mutilated.

UK Colonial Era: UK's richest 10% took half of India's wealth during colonial era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uks-richest-10-took-half-of-indias-wealth-during-colonial-era-oxfam-report/articleshow/117387937.cms,"Representative image

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

He allegedly rode a motorcycle on January 9, a week before the violent attack, which was captured by citywide CCTV cameras. The footage played a crucial role in the investigation and led to his identification.The Mumbai Police faced initial challenges in locating the assailant. Various teams were formed to comb through hours of CCTV footage from different locations across the city. Eventually, a breakthrough came when Fakir's former employer came forward and confirmed seeing him riding a motorcycle at a crossing in suburban Andheri, a pivotal lead that led to further investigation.With the help of advanced technology, police traced the suspect’s digital footprint. A payment made by Fakir at a food stall near Century Mill in Worli provided crucial evidence, allowing the authorities to narrow down his location to Thane. A search operation was immediately launched in the area, and Fakir was found lying in a dense mangrove area near a labour camp at Hiranandani Estate.On January 14, Saif Ali Khan was brutally stabbed by an intruder inside his upscale apartment at the 'Satguru Sharan' building in Bandra. The attack required immediate surgery, raising concerns about the security of the actor's residence and the motivations behind such a shocking assault.","Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammad Rohilla Amin Fakir, who had changed his name to Vijay Das, was tracked down following an extensive review of CCTV footage.

MUMBAI: Amid reports that he was upset about the Shiv Sena not bagging more posts for guardian ministers, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde left for his native village of Dare in Satara district over the weekend. Shinde refuted the claim that he was miffed with the BJP leadership and said he had come to Satara to review tourism projects. He added though that the issue over appointing guardian ministers would be decisively resolved when the chief minister and the two deputy CMs sit together.“When I come to my village, they start talking about my displeasure. However, I have come to the village for development work here… There is nothing wrong in expecting guardian ministership. Nashik and Raigad's guardian ministership will be resolved soon,” he said. A decision on guardianship of the two districts would come soon, he added. The District Planning and Development Council Funds which are allocated for local works are disbursed on the recommendations of the guardian minister.“Bharat Gogawale has made his displeasure clear, but what is wrong with expecting the guardian minister's post? He has worked in Raigad for the last many years,” Shinde said. Officials said Shinde had called chief minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Sunday and told him to stay appointments for Nashik and Raigad from Davos . Soon afterwards, orders were issued.The rollback in appointments prompted opposition leader and Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray to target the Mahayuti govt. “Late last night, a “stay” order was issued suddenly for the Guardian Ministries of Nashik and Raigad, while the CM was on a foreign tour. It is surprising to see the CM give in to pressure tactics of greedy politicians, who are already ministers but also want guardian ministries,” Aaditya said in a post on X.“Despite having strong numbers, the CM has given into the bullying of the traitor gang. Imagine, the gang burnt tyres and blocked a highway for an additional post for their leaders. This is how the BJP govt is being bullied by some. While citizens in Beed and Parbhani are struggling for justice, govt turns a blind eye and greedy ministers are busy trying to grab more.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday approved the rules & regulations for the Uniform Civil Code, paving the way for its implementation in the next 10 days. With this, Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in the country to adopt UCC since Independence.“We will soon announce the date for implementation. It will be a big change, which will start from Uttarakhand and spread to other states,” chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI. While he did not specify the exact date, sources indicated that the code may be rolled out on Jan 26 or 28. Dhami added that the training of over 2,000 govt employees has already been completed, and the trial run is expected to conclude in the coming days.UCC law includes seven schedules and 392 sections, addressing critical issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. It aims to eliminate practices like polygamy, polyandry, halala, iddat, and talaaq. The code also ensures equal property rights for all children and protects the rights of unborn children. According to the new rules, marriages and divorces conducted since 2010 must be registered within six months of the law’s notification. Similarly, marriages must be recorded within two months to avoid penalties, while live-in relationships and separations must be registered within 30 days.Asked about any changes to the report submitted by the rules and regulations panel in Oct 2024, home secretary Shailesh Bagauli told TOI, “Around 80-90% of the report has been retained, and the law’s essence remains unchanged. At the same time, it needs to be understood that rules are subordinate legislation and only define the procedures for implementing the Act. Rules cannot amend the Act.”","Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday approved the rules & regulations for the Uniform Civil Code.

MUMBAI: Legal experts on Monday asked why Mumbai police had not yet invoked the offence of attempt to murder separately against actor Saif Ali Khan ’s alleged assailant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir alias Bijoy Das.“The police can surely add the section under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) even if it has invoked dacoity with an attempt to kill since, going by the allegations of the six stab injuries on Saif Ali Khan, the offence is prima facie attracted,” senior advocate Pranav Badheka said.The accused was booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 311 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 312 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with a deadly weapon), and 331 (4) (6) (7) (house-trespass).Later on, sections under the Foreigners Order, 1948, under the Foreigners Act, 1946, were also added as the police said Shariful Fakir was a Bangladeshi national.Badheka said Section 109 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita could well be attracted and invoked by Mumbai police. Since the account of the attack, as seen in media reports, shows the grievous injury caused by the persistent stabbing in the neck and spine areas with the weapon left stuck in the spine, it was suggestive of the injury being serious and “major” as the doctors said and ought to have been considered by the police to invoke the attempt to murder offence.Section 109 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita makes it an offence of attempt to murder if anyone “does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with 10 years’ imprisonment, and if the victim is hurt, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life or to 10 years.”Senior advocate Satish Maneshinde said the police ought to invoke the attempt to murder offence in the case, as ordinarily no burglar would stab so many times. The sheer number of stab injuries and major injuries — half a dozen — is indicative or suggestive of an attempt to kill. Both lawyers and even others practising criminal law said there was also a need to add attempt to murder in the case because, if for some reason the charge of robbery is not sustained, the case may fall flat.","Experts ask why Mumbai police had not yet invoked the offence of attempt to murder separately against alleged assailant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir alias Bijoy Das. “The police can surely add the section under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) even if it has invoked dacoity with an attempt to kill since, going by the allegations of the six stab injuries, the offence is prima facie attracted,” senior advocate Pranav Badheka said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117407838,imgsize-55144,width-400,resizemode-4/117407838.jpg"
Saif Ali Khan attack suspect may have criminal record in Bangladesh: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saif-ali-khan-attack-suspect-may-have-criminal-record-in-bangladesh-cops/articleshow/117407776.cms,"Saif Ali Khan and the Mumbai police with the suspect

MUMBAI: The police said on Monday that they would recreate the series of events leading to the knife attack on Saif Ali Khan while taking care that the actor or his family does not have to mentally relive the trauma of last week’s violent experience.“We have to be mindful that the actor and his family are traumatised after everything that they have been through. All precautions will be taken while recreating the sequence of events at the crime scene,” an officer said.A 150-member police team tracked down the suspect, Shariful Fakir , a Bangladeshi national believed to be living illegally here, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation early on Sunday.The police have strong reason to believe that Shariful might have had a prior criminal record in Bangladesh. “He had carried tools used for burglaries such as hammers et cetera, besides the knife. The CCTV footage shows him going up the building without footwear but wearing his shoes on his way downstairs. This indicates he was careful to carry his shoes in his bag on his way up as he had climbed up the pipes,” an officer said.Back in Bangladesh, Shariful has two brothers. His parents also live there. He is not married and has no relatives here. The police have not found any Indian identification documents on him.“A day after the crime, Shariful saw his CCTV images being flashed on television news. He panicked on realising that the police were on his trail. He went into hiding in Thane with plans to board the Geetanjali Express to Howrah and cross the border to Bangladesh,” an officer said.Before Shariful could execute his escape, a police team tracked him down.A team of 75 policemen involved in the case was felicitated on Monday by joint police commissioner (law and order) Satyanarayan.Political attacks over the incident continued, with Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray criticising the Centre and state govt over the Bangladeshi nationality of the suspect in the Khan attack case. Thackeray said that the man turning out to be a Bangladeshi illegal immigrant was concerning.He said the home departments, whether at the Centre or state, were with the BJP for the past decade and the party could not blame anyone else for the illegal immigration problem.“The protection of cross-border illegal immigration is the duty of the union govt, which clearly failed to do so in the past decade,” Thackeray said in a post on X.“Those from any political party, trying to make it a political issue, must actually question the central govt on its failure to curb illegal immigration from Bangladesh. The Centre must release true figures of the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh in our country, and tell us how many they deported in the past 10 years, and what action they’re taking now,” he said.","A 150-member police team tracked down the suspect, Shariful Fakir, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation early on Sunday.

PM Modi wrote on X.Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the US by Chief Justice John Roberts in a ceremony held indoors at the Capitol Rotunda, a rare occurrence only previously seen in 1985 when Ronald Reagan took the oath for his second term. This marked Trump’s return to the presidency, making him the second US president after Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive terms.Trump and outgoing president Joe Biden rode together to the Capitol for the ceremony following a traditional tea gathering at the White House, where they were joined by their wives, Jill Biden and Melania Trump, as well as vice president Kamala Harris and her successor, JD Vance, along with their spouses. Notably, Jill Biden and Melania Trump shared a separate car ride to the Capitol, as did Kamala Harris and JD Vance.The ceremony drew prominent figures, including tech leaders such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla and SpaceX’s Elon Musk, and Google’s Sundar Pichai. Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush, and Barack Obama also attended, along with their spouses, except for Michelle Obama, who was notably absent. This upheld the tradition of former presidents attending, which Trump himself broke in 2021 by skipping Biden’s inauguration.The event also featured Trump’s cabinet nominees, including Marco Rubio, the incoming secretary of state, who is anticipated to be confirmed swiftly. Before the swearing-in, Trump attended a private service at St. John’s Church with Melania Trump, JD Vance, Usha Vance, and several cabinet members.During the White House tea ceremony, Biden reportedly greeted Trump with the words, “Welcome home,” symbolizing the transition of power.","PM Narendra Modi congratulated Donald Trump as he took oath on Monday as the 47th president of the United States.

Their stories are inspiring young women to break free from conventions

‘Villagers mocked me for wearing shorts, said rugby isn’t for girls’

Assistant coach Anisha Khural says the story of these young girls will inspire other women to break free from conventions and join the game

DEHRADUN: Rugby wasn’t meant to find its way to the rugged lanes of rural Uttarakhand, where traditions are deeply rooted and opportunities, particularly for women, often fall through the crevasses. Yet, breaking barriers, young women from modest backgrounds are rewriting their destinies — with the grit needed for a scrum — to make a name for themselves in the hard sport.Shivani Pal, 21, from Roorkee’s Puhana village knows what it’s like to face resistance head-on. As the eldest of six siblings, she watched her dad ferry construction material on a bullock cart, a job that kept the family afloat but spared little to pursue dreams. Then rugby happened — her tryst with the game taking shape five years ago when she stumbled upon a Telugu movie, Sye.That odd pill-shaped ball caught my eye. Later, I saw a friend’s reel and couldn’t help but ask questions. She introduced me to her coach, and soon I was on the state team,” Shivani told TOI.What followed wasn’t a smooth, unhindered trot to the touchline; it was a bruising grapple. “People in my village mocked me for wearing shorts and said rugby was not for girls,” Shivani said. “Some even tried to pressure my family to stop me.” But she held her ground with the fortitude of a dogged forward. Her parents stood by her side, turning a deaf ear to the critics. Over time, she not only played in two national tournaments but also founded her own rugby club, training young girls from nearby villages. “I want these girls to dream bigger,” she said. “This sport has given me purpose, and I want others to experience the same.”In Dehradun, Jasvinder Kaur’s journey to the pitch was more of a sidestep. The daughter of a street hawker, she had a name as a state-level long-jump athlete before rugby entered her life six months ago. “I heard about rugby from a teammate,” she said. “It was unlike anything I’d done before — the sheer physicality and teamwork excited me.” Jasvinder’s athleticism made her a natural fit for the sport, and she quickly secured a spot on the state team. And shone.But like a player in a ruck, she faced her challenges. A collarbone injury during a match four months ago would have sidelined many, but not Jasvinder. “I didn’t let it red-card my ambitions,” she said with a smile. “My parents, with whatever meagre earnings they had, supported me through recovery and urged me to focus on trials for the National Games.” Her perseverance paid off, and now she’s eyeing gold for Uttarakhand.Radhika, a 21-year-old from Roorkee, likens her entry into rugby to an unexpected kick-off. Introduced to the sport by her cousin, she found herself intrigued by its intensity. “At first, it was daunting,” she admitted. “But I couldn’t resist the challenge.”With her mother, an anganwadi worker, cheering from the sidelines, Radhika quickly rose through the ranks, competing in two national tournaments within two years. “Rugby has taught me resilience,” she said. “The criticism from villagers didn’t faze me because my family was a like a solid defence line behind me.”The newest recruit to the state rugby team is 20-year-old Anjali Saini from Haridwar’s Laksar. “I saw a video on social media and was immediately hooked,” she said, her enthusiasm palpable. Anjali’s parents, farmers by trade, supported her wholeheartedly but added a word of caution. “They worry about injuries,” she said.Assistant coach Anisha Khural marvels at their tenacity. “Their stories will inspire women to break free from conventions and join the game.”","Young women from modest backgrounds rewriting their destinies to make a name for themselves in the hard sport.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the trial court proceedings against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in a criminal defamation case filed against him for allegedly making defamatory remarks against home minister Amit Shah during the AICC’s plenary sessions in Jharkhand in 2018.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta issued notice to Jharkhand govt and the complainant seeking their response on Gandhi’s plea for quashing of the criminal proceedings .Abhishek Manu Singhvi , appearing on behalf of Rahul Gandhi, raised a question on how a person, who is not affected by an alleged defamatory statement, could file a complaint. He said the principles regarding this have been settled in at least seven SC judgments. Appearing for the complainant, advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said he was opposing the plea. SC thereafter granted four weeks to Jharkhand govt and complainant Navin Jha to file their responses. “All proceedings shall remain stayed till further orders,” court ordered.Rahul approached SC after his plea for quashing the case was rejected by Jharkhand HC, which said Gandhi’s statement was prima facie defamatory in nature. It noted that Gandhi’s speech had imputed BJP leadership “to be liars drunk with power and that BJP workers will accept a person accused of murder as BJP chief, but people will never accept the same in Congress”.",The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the trial court proceedings against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in a criminal defamation case filed against him for allegedly making defamatory remarks.

AHMEDABAD: Present-day Vallabhipur , 40km from Bhavnagar, is a town in Gujarat with 15,000 people. But between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE, it was the seat of the Maitrakas , one of the region’s early rulers. The town was famed for its university, Valabhi Vidyapith, which was compared with Nalanda in Bihar by Chinese travellers Xuanzang and Yijing in 7th century CE. A recent study has found remains of the town in satellite imagery.The findings, published in the Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, claim to have located the ancient town’s ruling seat, university and monastery.The study, “Ancient Valabhi: A Remote Sensing Perspective”, by Arya Pradeep and M Rajani of National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru, draws parallels with existing structures of similar nature to identify the remains, buried beneath the existing town.Rajani told TOI that it started with a collaborative project with SAC-ISRO on geo-archaeology. The sites selected were those that had undergone geomorphological changes. “Along with Gangetic delta and Krishna-Godavari delta, we selected Valabhi.”Pradeep, an architect and researcher, said Valabhi was a capital and port city at one time. “But we do not have much evidence regarding location or extent. Thus, satellite images were used to find patterns and spectral signatures of the landscape. It revealed important clues about an ancient site and its probable linkages to other significant cultural sites,” she said.The researchers identified two archaeological mounds — named by them as Mound M and Mounds M1 to M6. Mound M is a rough square of 350 x 350 metres and is believed to be the fortified part of the town. Mounds M1 to M6 are in straight line with a length of about 350 metres — the researchers believe these are the monasteries.The study points at a square construction that can be found in Vikramshila in India and Somapura in Bangladesh, whereas a very similar monastery pattern is found in a group of monasteries at Nalanda Mahavira complex.“The information from Maitraka copper plate grants testifies to presence of several monasteries and prominent monastic clusters in ancient Valabhi,” the study says.What next? Rajani said systematic surveys using other non-invasive techniques can help identify specific sites that can be excavated.","Present-day Vallabhipur, 40km from Bhavnagar, is a town in Gujarat with 15,000 people.

KOLKATA: A sessions court in Kolkata Monday sentenced former traffic police volunteer Sanjay Roy (35) to jail for the remainder of his life for raping and murdering a 31-year-old junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year, acknowledging that it resisted “the temptation to bow to public pressure or emotional appeals” and pronounce death as the case couldn’t be categorised as “rarest of rare”, report Rohit Khanna & Srishti Lakhotia.Citing SC guidelines stating that capital punishment should be handed “only in exceptional circumstances where the community’s collective conscience is so shocked that it expects death”, Sealdah additional sessions judge Anirban Das’s 172-page order states, “We must rise above the primitive instinct of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a nail for a nail, or a life for a life.”The order further states, “The court must focus on delivering a verdict that upholds the integrity of the legal system and serves the broader interests of justice...Considering the overall facts and circumstances, we hold this is not a case where the possibility of reformation is completely ruled out. It would be inappropriate to accede to the prosecution’s request for the death penalty. The court’s duty is to pass a sentence that is proportionate, just and in accordance with established legal principles.”Acknowledging “the immense grief and suffering of the victim’s parents, for which no sentence can provide complete solace,” the court asked the state to pay Rs 17 lakh — Rs 7 lakh as compensation for rape and Rs 10 lakh for murder – to the victim’s kin. The junior doctor’s parents, who were present in the courtroom, stood up and told the judge they only wanted justice. The couple had previously turned down the state government’s offer of compensation.Convict Roy, who was fined Rs 1 lakh, pleaded innocence again and claimed to be unaware of the contents of documents he was made to sign in police custody. He was convicted Saturday under sections 64 (rape), 66 (causing injury resulting in death of rape victim), and 103 (1) (murder) of the new penal code Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) after a 66-day trial.Section 103(1) mandates the death penalty or life imprisonment; Section 66 provides for imprisonment of not less than 20 years, which may extend to life; and Section 64 recommends imprisonment of not less than 10 years, which may extend to a jail term spanning the remainder of the convict’s life.“The convict’s act was barbaric and brutal. The gruesome acts were diabolical in conception and cruel in execution,” the verdict states.“Roy attacked the victim and raped and then smothered and throttled her to death. The CCTV footage, Roy’s contradictory statements in court and the DNA reports all indicated he was the only perpetrator...I have no confusion that the seminar room, more particularly the dais, again more precisely the mattress on the dais was the scene of crime.”The crime on campus had sparked spontaneous protests that spread from Kolkata to various parts of the country and even abroad. A 10-week junior doctors’ agitation ended on Oct 21 after meetings with CM Mamata Banerjee, who made a series of administrative changes and promised reforms in the health department to placate the protesters. Monday’s proceedings started at 12.30pm in courtroom number 210, with the CBI counsel pushing for the death penalty.“She (the victim) was a meritorious student. It is not only a loss for the family but for (the entire) society, which has been shattered by the brutality (of the crime). People will lose confidence if Roy is not given death. A lot of girls go for higher education; people will lose confidence if they are not safe,” the prosecution said.The victim’s parents, too, pleaded that the court pronounce capital punishment.Roy, who was given a microphone to speak, declared, “I have been framed. I was tortured in custody. I was made to sign documents about which I have no idea.”The judge stopped Roy at this point and said he wanted his opinion only on the maximum punishment he deserved. “I am here to judge the case based on the evidence placed before me. I feel that the prosecution’s charge is correct and that is why you have been convicted,” Judge Das observed.",A sessions court in Kolkata Monday sentenced former traffic police volunteer Sanjay Roy (35) to jail for the remainder of his life for raping and murdering a 31-year-old junior doctor.

44% of AAP’s income last fiscal came via poll bonds

NEW DELHI: Regional parties received the lion’s share of their donations in 2023-24 via electoral bonds before they were scrapped by Supreme Court on Feb 15, 2024, as per annual audit reports filed by them with Election Commission.Trinamool Congress received Rs 612.4 crore between March 31, 2023 and Feb 15, 2024, followed by BRS with bonds receipts worth Rs 495.5 crore, BJD at Rs 245.5 crore, TDP’s at Rs 174.1 crore, YSR Congress Party’s at Rs 121.5 crore, DMK’s at Rs 60 crore, JMM’s at Rs 11.5 crore, and Sikkim Democratic Front’s at Rs 5.5 crore.While 95% of TMC’s total income was from bonds, it was 72% for BRS, 82% for BJD, 61% for TDP, 64% for YSRCP, 33% for DMK, 73% for JMM.Among the four national parties whose annual audit reports for 2023-24 are available on the Election Commission’s website, only AAP has declared contributions via electoral bonds, albeit under the broader category of receipts through electoral bonds/electoral trusts. However, since AAP’s contribution report for 2023-24 did not declare any donation from electoral trusts, it may be safe to assume that the entire Rs 10.1 crore shown under the ‘donations from bonds/trusts’ head has flown from bonds. This constitutes over 44% of the total income declared by AAP in 2023-24.A comparison of annual audit reports for 2023-24 and 2022-23 shows an 88% jump in TMC’s receipts from electoral bonds, 61% rise for BJD, 133% for YSRCP, 412% for TDP and 858% for JMM. SDF did not declare any donations through bonds in 2022-23.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday witnessed heated exchange of words between solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Colin Gonsalves over the burial of a Christian man from a Scheduled Tribe (ST) community in Chhattisgarh and the court also expressed its pain that a man had to move to top court to bury his father.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma was hearing a plea filed by Ramesh Baghel who moved SC against the Chhattisgarh HC order refusing to allow him to bury his father in his native village.Opposing the plea, the SG said that petitioner’s insistence to bury the man in the burial ground of his family’s native village was an attempt to create unrest between tribal Hindus and Christians. Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioner, countered saying that it was an attempt to kick out tribal Christians.Amidst heated exchange, the court said, “Why should a person who has lived in a particular village be not buried in that village? The body is lying in the morgue since January 7. Sorry to say that a man has to come to the Supreme Court for burial of his father. We are sorry to say that neither the Panchayat, nor the state govt or the high court was able to resolve this problem. We are surprised by the high court’s remark that there will be a law and order problem . We are pained to see that a person is unable to bury his father and has to come to the SC.”Mehta informed the court that there was no burial ground for Christians and the man could be buried in a place 20 kilometres away from the village.Gonsalves, however, said the affidavit submitted by the state showed his family members were also buried in the village. Referring to the affidavit, Gonsalves said the deceased was not being allowed the burial as he was Christian.

BATHINDA: Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) on Monday urged farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal to end his fast to regain his strength to represent the farmers in talks with Central govt. It also sought the relocation of the meeting venue to Delhi, instead of Chandigarh, on an earlier date, instead of the scheduled Feb 14, much to the chagrin of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political).“The model code of conduct reason holds no ground. When the code was in force, the Centre announced the 8th Pay Commission. What is the problem in holding talks in Delhi? If any announcement has to be made, it could be made after Feb 9,” said Sarvan Singh Pandher, a prominent KMM leader. However, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) leader Abhimanyu Kohad insisted on the scheduled location and date for the meeting with Central Govt. Kohad urged KMM to let the first meeting take place in Chandigarh, and next rounds, if needed, can be conducted in Delhi.","Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) on Monday urged farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal to end his fast to regain his strength.

NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

"Telangana assembly passes 2 bills to up backward classes quota to 42%, total reservation to 70%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-assembly-passes-2-bills-to-up-backward-class-quota-to-42-total-reservation-to-70/articleshow/119139009.cms,"T’gana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case



HYDERABAD : An eight-hour reservation debate in the Telangana assembly on Monday culminated in the passage of two landmark bills that aim to extend the quantum of reservation in education , govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%, breaching Supreme Court’s cap on quotas.CM A Revanth Reddy showcased political unanimity in passing the bills – BRS, BJP, AIMIM and CPI backed the move – as a sign that the state’s reservation framework deserved to be enshrined with a constitutional amendment during the ongoing session of Parliament.The first of the proposed laws — Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 — proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs, up from the existing 29% for BCs, 15% for SCs and 6% for STs.Telangana Backward Classes (reservation of seats in rural and urban local bodies) Bill 2025 extends the 42% BC quota to rural and urban local bodies. Before this, BC reservation in local bodies ranged from 18% to 23%, depending on population of each municipality or panchayat.Revanth put his hand up to lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi and other senior MPs to press for the proposed constitutional amendment. He said empirical data from a door-to-door survey by state govt would drive this amendment. The data, which includes information on BCs, SCs, and STs, is being presented as a bulletproof argument for exceeding the 50% cap on reservations, a step Supreme Court had indicated could be considered if the numbers backed it.Speaker Gaddam Prasad Kumar said the initial plan was to earmark 15% for SCs, which was increased to 18% based on a suggestion by AIMIM’s Akbaruddin Owaisi. But the House rejected three amendments proposed by BRS. These called for a 42% quota for BCs in all govt contracts, creation of a BC subplan similar to those for SCs and STs, and a Rs 20,000-crore allocation for BC welfare in the upcoming budget.Revanth, along with deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka and BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar, expressed confidence that a constitutional amendment was a matter of time. Prabhakar urged all political parties to set aside their differences to institutionalise the 42% BC quota, drawing inspiration from Tamil Nadu’s success in securing similar reservation for them through bipartisan support.The assembly also discussed Telangana Scheduled Castes (rationalisation of reservations) Bill, which deals with the sub-classification of SCs. It will be debated on Tuesday before being sent to the governor for approval. Supreme Court has empowered states to sub-classify SCs.Revanth informed the House that the erstwhile BRS govt had sent a proposal to Centre for 37% BC reservation. He said Congress govt would withdraw that proposal and send a new one for 42% reservation as the two proposals couldn’t coexist.","Two landmark bills aim to extend quantum of reservation in education, govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%. Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119139014,imgsize-66918,width-400,resizemode-4/119139014.jpg"
India’s 2nd spaceport in TN will see first SSLV launch in 2027: Isro chief; says Centre has given nod for Chandrayaan-5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-2nd-spaceport-in-tn-will-see-first-sslv-launch-in-2027-isro-chief-says-centre-has-given-nod-for-chandrayaan-5/articleshow/119138195.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Isro’s second spaceport outside Andhra Pradesh’s Sriharikota, which is coming up at Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV within 24 months, space agency chairman V Narayanan said on Monday. The new spaceport will enhance India’s capabilities in space launch services.“All facilities will be commissioned for launch in 24 months. The first launch will take place in two years. Don’t think it will be literally small in size. It will be a 500 kg satellite,” Narayanan said in Chennai after inaugurating a new research centre, ‘S Ramakrishnan Centre of Excellence for Research in Fluid and Thermal Science,' at IIT-Madras.In another big development, the Isro chairman on Sunday said the Centre has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country’s long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. He highlighted the growing scope of India’s lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.He said Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan.During this year, Isro has planned a series of launches, including GSLV, a commercial satellite from the US, and unmanned test mission with humanoid as part of the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said.PM Modi had remotely laid the foundation stone for Kulasekharapattinam spaceport on Feb 28, 2024. The selection of this TN spaceport offers strategic advantages, particularly in enhancing payload capability with its direct southward launch trajectory for small launch vehicles. The new spaceport will house 35 facilities, including a launchpad, rocket integration facilities, ground range and checkout facilities, and a mobile launch structure (MLS) with checkout computers. It will have the capacity to launch 24 satellites every year using a mobile launch structure.Spread over 2,350 acres, the Kulasekharapatnam spaceport will help save fuel for small rocket launches as the port can launch rockets directly south over the Indian Ocean without requiring crossing landmasses.","Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV within 24 months.

"Gujjar brothers’ deaths rock J&K assembly: NC legislators join oppn in protest, demand fair probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujjar-brothers-deaths-rock-jk-assembly-nc-legislators-join-oppn-in-protest-demand-fair-probe/articleshow/119137595.cms,"SRINAGAR: Mysterious deaths of two tribal Gujjar brothers, whose bodies were recovered days apart recently after a month of disappearance, rocked J&K assembly Monday.Opposition legislators and those of governing National Conference (NC), many waving placards, sought an inquiry into the “suspicious deaths”. Unlike in other states, the Omar Abdullah-led NC govt does not control J&K police, who are under the Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha in the Union Territory.The MLAs also pressed for action against cops for allegedly beating up protesting women mourners after the second body was found in a decomposed condition Sunday in a river in J&K’s Kulgam district . The other had been found nearby on March 13.Showkat Ahmad Bajad and brother Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13. There is still no trace of Mukhtar Ahmad Awan village, a relative of the brothers who had accompanied them to a wedding in the Mir Bazar area of the same district the day all three went missing. The three worked in a brick kiln.“It seems part of the pattern,” People’s Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed Parra said on Monday. He alleged several such unexplained deaths in J&K in the past few months within the nomadic Gujjar community. Parra cited another youth’s suicide after alleged police torture in Kathua last month as well as the latest deaths in Kulgam, saying all should probed as they were tied to one specific community.NC MLAs Nazir Gurazi and Qaisar Jamsheed Lone expressed concern over the situation in J&K deteriorating to an extent where people just vanished and their bodies were found days and weeks later. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC pressed for a fair investigation into the Kulgam deaths.On Monday, local authorities did not allow PDP’s Iltija Mufti to visit Kulgam. PDP member Talib Hussain, who was at the site when Showkat’s body was found on Sunday, had accused police of baton-charging mourners when they questioned how investigators had arrived at suicide as the cause of death.Back in the assembly, Sajad Lone, People’s Conference MLA from Handwara, flagged the alleged police atrocities, calling images of a police officer kicking female relatives of the deceased brothers “utterly disdainful”. “The whole action reeks of contempt within the minds of those who are supposed to protect masses. It is almost a daily occurrence,” Lone said. J&K police said they had ordered an inquiry into the officer’s conduct.Investigators said the brothers may have died by suicide. This was based on conclusions of a forensic expert, Dr Azia Manzoor Bhat, that Riyaz’s body indicated he had drowned and the case “doesn’t look homicidal in nature”.On Feb 6, a week before the Kulgam brothers went missing, 25-year-old tribal Makhan Din died by suicide alleging torture by police in Kathua district. He recorded a video before his death claiming cops were forcing him into confessing links with militants.",Showkat Ahmad Bajad and brother Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13.

NAGPUR: Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad spiralled into chaos, leaving dozens wounded and causing widespread destruction.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen suffered serious wounds in the unrest, while a constable remains in critical condition in hospital. Mobs torched two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces struggled to contain the violence. Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs. DCPs Archit Chandak and Niketan Kadam were wounded while attempting to control the crowds. Firefighters were also caught in the crossfire as they tried to extinguish burning vehicles. Several neighbourhoods remained tense as sporadic violence continued.Also read: Nagpur violence: Fresh violence erupts in Hansapuri; section 144 imposed, situation under control Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal deployed more than 1,000 officers and imposed prohibitory orders in Mahal, Chitnis Park Chowk and Bhaldarpura, restricting movement in the most sensitive areas.

'Independence of CAG inbuilt': Supreme Court on petition for new appointment method,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/independence-of-cag-inbuilt-supreme-court-on-petition-for-new-appointment-method/articleshow/119137051.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought govt's response to a PIL seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of CAG on the lines of the one the court had devised for CVC, but not before asking, ""When Constitution provides for unbridled power to executive to appoint CAG, should we rewrite that provision?""""Constitution says once appointed as CAG, the person enjoys constitutional protection from arbitrary removal by executive as he/she can be removed only through a removal motion in Parliament,"" Justice Surya Kant said. ""The provisions have ensured CAG's independence,"" the bench also comprising Justice N Kotiswar Singh said.Prolific PIL litigant ' Centre for Public Interest Litigation ', through advocate Prashant Bhushan, told SC that though CAG was considered independent and impartial in the past, it had lost its stature because of the drop in number of audits it conducted of Centre and states governed by the party in office at Centre.Justice Kant, however, did not seem to fully agree with the contention about erosion of the federal auditor's autonomy. ""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years. A similar mechanism was laid down for appointment of ED director.In 2023, SC had detected a vacuum in the law for appointment of CEC and ruled that CEC and ECs would be selected by a panel comprising PM, CJI and LoP. However, it also said it was for Parliament to decide the constitution of the collegium.","Supreme Court seeks govt's response to a PIL seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of CAG.

Devotees worship Lord Ganesha on this day to seek his blessings for the removal of difficulties and to bring success, prosperity, and well-being. The specific term Bhalachandra Sankashti Chaturthi refers to a particular occasion when the Chaturthi of the waning moon falls on the day dedicated to Lord Ganesha. The name Bhalachandra is associated with Lord Ganesha’s form, where he is depicted with a radiant or glowing moon on his forehead, symbolizing purity, auspiciousness, and divine grace. The day is considered very auspicious for the worship of Lord Ganesha, with special importance placed on fasting, prayers, and performing rituals to remove obstacles in life and to seek divine blessings for peace, prosperity, and success.Lord Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles (Vighnaharta). Devotees worship him on Bhalachandra Sankashti Chaturthi to seek his divine intervention in overcoming any challenges or difficulties they may be facing.

Fasting and performing prayers on this day are believed to help devotees spiritually cleanse themselves and gain a sense of peace and enlightenment. It is a time to reflect on personal growth, seek wisdom, and make positive changes in life. According to Hindu astrology, the waning moon is associated with the removal of negativity and past karma. As Bhalachandra Sankashti Chaturthi coincides with the day of the waning moon, it is considered an ideal time to invoke divine blessings and purify one’s soul.The fast is typically observed from sunrise until the moonrise, and devotees break their fast after sighting the moon. The fast is believed to cleanse the mind and body, and it is a way of showing devotion and seeking blessings from Lord Ganesha. A special Ganesh puja is performed during the day, where offerings of sweets, fruits, and coconut are made to Lord Ganesha. Modaks, which are considered Lord Ganesha’s favorite sweet, are offered in particular. Devotees recite prayers, including the famous Ganesh mantra, “Om Gan Ganapataye Namah,” to invoke his blessings. Devotees often spend the day in spiritual reflection, meditation, and chanting. Some choose to visit temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha, while others perform the rituals at home. The day is considered ideal for seeking forgiveness for past mistakes, purifying one’s thoughts, and focusing on spiritual growth.","Bhalachandra Sankashti Chaturthi is an important Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Ganesha.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his debut on Truth Social on Monday and was quick to respond to US President Donald Trump, who had shared a link to Modi’s recent podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman.In his reply, PM Modi thanked Trump and highlighted the broad themes he covered in the podcast, including his personal journey, India’s civilisational outlook, and global issues.“Thank you, my friend, President Trump. I’ve covered a wide range of topics, including my life journey, India’s civilisational outlook, global issues, and more,” PM Modi wrote on Truth Social.Trump had earlier posted a YouTube link to PM Modi’s extensive conversation with Fridman, which lasted nearly three hours.In the podcast, the Prime Minister Modi spoke at length about his experiences with Trump, their close working relationship, and his admiration for Trump’s leadership style. He recalled key moments such as the grand ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston in 2019 and shared how Trump had personally taken him on a guided tour of the White House, detailing historical facts without notes.PM Modi also commended Trump’s resilience after the recent assassination attempt, stating that his unwavering commitment to America reminded him of his own “Nation First” principle.PM Modi’s arrival on Truth Social is significant, as the platform is primarily associated with Trump’s supporters and conservative voices in the US. His first post read, “Delighted to be on Truth Social! Looking forward to interacting with all the passionate voices here and engaging in meaningful conversations in the times to come.”Trump has often praised PM Modi, calling him a “tough and better negotiator,” a remark the Indian leader addressed in the podcast, saying that while he appreciated the compliment, his focus has always been on India’s interests in any negotiations. PM Modi also noted that Trump appeared more prepared for his second presidential term, suggesting that he had a clearer roadmap and well-defined goals.The exchange between the two leaders comes at a crucial time, as India and the US are engaged in negotiations over trade tariffs.Trump has previously criticised India’s high tariff rates, while the Indian government has assured a parliamentary panel that no firm commitments have been made yet, with discussions ongoing.","US President Donald Trump had shared a link to PM Modi’s recent podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman.

2025 assembly elections: Is Nitish Kumar preparing for 'son'rise in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-assembly-elections-is-nitish-kumar-preparing-for-sonrise-in-bihar/articleshow/119122438.cms,"In January this year, Nitish made a public appearance with his son at a political function. At this function, Nishant made his first political remark as he sought votes for his father in the upcoming assembly elections. Nishant also highlighted why JD(U)needed more seats to ensure that Nitish Kumar's leadership continues for the progress and development of the state.

Holi festivities at Nitish Kumar's residence this year saw Nishant participating actively and engaging with senior JD(U) leaders.

Then appeared a large hoarding outside the Janata Dal (United) office in Patna featuring son Nishant alongside his father. The poster, which prominently displayed Nishant Kumar next to Nitish Kumar, read, "" Bihar ki maang, sun liye Nishant, bahut bahut dhanyawaad "" (Nishant, thank you very much for listening to the demands of Bihar).

JD(U) at crossroads? Why Nitish needs Nishant

NEW DELHI: Is Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has been a very strong critic of political dynasts, preparing ground for his son Nishant Kumar 's plunge into politics? For years, dynasty politics has been one of the strongest weapons used by Nitish to attack his rival Lalu Prasad, who promoted his wife, sons and daughters in politics.But now, there are very strong indications that Nitish may lose that poll plank in the year-end assembly elections. Nishant, who has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades, may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father, who has been under opposition fire over health issues.Here's a look at some of the recent developments that have led to these speculations ...Clearly, more than the demand of Bihar, it is the demand of a section of JD(U) leaders who are perhaps worried over the consistent opposition attacks questioning the health of Nitish Kumar. They believe Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward Nitish Kumar's political legacy.Neither Nishant nor the JD(U) has made any official statement on this. However, in January, when Nishant was asked about his possible political plunge, this is what he said: ""The public will decide what happens next. Let them judge who is capable.""A clever statement that was not just politically correct but also open ended to ensure the chatter around his poltiical plunge continues.Nitish Kumar's present ally - the BJP, which has used dynasty politics as one of its most potent weapons to attack the opposition, was guarded in its response to the possibility of a new 'son'rise in the state. Bihar deputy chief minister and BJP leader Samrat Choudhary has already said that his party will back whatever decision JD(U) takes on Nitish Kumar's son. The other allies of JD(U) have also been guarded in their response while welcoming Nishant if he decided to join politics.Interestingly, it was opposition RJD's Tejashwi who perhaps made the strongest call to Nishant to join politics.""He is our brother. I want him to join politics as soon as possible; otherwise, the BJP will finish the JD(U)--the party formed by Sharad Yadav. He should join politics soon. If he joins politics, then there would be the possibility that JD(U) will survive. It will depend on how Nishant works for the party. We joined politics not because our parents asked us to do it but because the people of Bihar and our party workers needed that,"" Tejashwi had said reacting to rumours of Nishant joining politics.It is natural for Tejashwi, who has been at the receiving end of relentless dynast attacks - both from Nitish and the BJP, to welcome the development.With Tejashwi and Chirag, son of late Ram Vilas Paswan, already in active politics, if and when Nishant decides to take the plunge, it would complete the troika of three second generation leaders in Bihar politics - following into the footsteps of their fathers.The JD(U), which has been dominant in state politics for nearly 20 decades, faced perhaps its biggest challenge in the last assembly elections when the party was reduced to being the junior partner in the NDA for the first time.Nitish could manage to win just 45 seats compared to BJP's 74. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise of forming a government under Nitish Kumar's leadership and the JD(U) chief was back as chief minister despite reduced numerical strength.Nitish Kumar did salvage some pride when JD(U) won 14 seats, same as the BJP, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The number enough to make a hero out of Nitish Kumar for providing valuable support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA-3 government.However, as the assembly elections approach once again, Nitish would be worried about his party's political fortunes. With Nishant to assist him in managing the party, Nitish would be more focussed on trying to restore the lost political glory of JD(U).For over two decades, JD(U) has literally been a one-man show, both at the state and at the national level. Till now, keeping the family away from the party was the USP of Nitish, but with the party's declining fortunes and his advancing age, the Bihar chief minister perhaps may not have that option anymore.While Nitish is yet to open up on the issue, he has not stopped his ministers and party leaders from raising the pitch for Nishant. Perhaps, the Bihar chief minister is testing the waters for now.","Nishant Kumar has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades. He may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father, who has been under opposition fire over health issues. Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward Nitish Kumar's political legacy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119123325,imgsize-107442,width-400,resizemode-4/119123325.jpg"
In 7 charts: Indian-Americans concerned about India-US ties under Trump 2.0; bullish on India's trajectory under PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-7-charts-indian-americans-concerned-about-india-us-ties-under-trump-2-0-bullish-on-indias-trajectory-under-pm-modi/articleshow/118973218.cms,"On India's trajectory

BJP, PM Modi's popularity



Although Indian-Americans shifted to the right politically ahead of the 2024 US election, many remain concerned about what the future holds for US-India ties under a second Trump administration, as per the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS).Donald Trump's economic policies, particularly his protectionist stance and focus on ""reciprocal taxes"", have put India-US trade relations under strain. Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly criticised India's high import duties, which he has said are ""unfair"" to American exporters.His proposed tariffs on Indian exports could severely impact sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, which rely heavily on the US market.Additionally, his administration's stricter immigration policies, such as tightening H-1B visa requirements, could further affect India's tech workforce in the US, thus further straining ties.As per the IAAS report — conducted before the US presidential election results — many Indian-Americans are concerned about bilateral relations under the Trump administration. In fact, Indian-Americans rate the Joe Biden administration 's record on India slightly better than the first Trump administration.Thirty-four percent of respondents identified Biden as doing a better job, and 28 percent said Trump handled bilateral relations better during his first term. Roughly the same proportion, 26 percent, felt the presidents' performances were generally the same.In addition, respondents said bilateral relationship would have been more likely to prosper under a putative Kamala Harris administration compared to a second Trump administration.The survey also asked respondents which American political party does a better job managing US-India relations .A total of 41 percent of respondents said the Democratic Party while 24 percent named the Republican Party. One-quarter of all respondents perceived no difference between the two parties.As the 2024 IAAS was fielded before the US election, it also asked two questions about the prospects for US-India ties under a putative Kamala Harris or second Trump administration. A total of 53 percent of respondents said US-India ties would become stronger if Harris had been elected, 15 per cent state they would get worse, and 32 percent reported they would not change.Respondents were somewhat less bullish on prospects under a second Trump presidency. Forty percent reported ties would improve, 26 percent felt they would worsen, and 34 percent opined they would be unchanged.Compared to 2020, Indian-Americans are more bullish on India’s trajectory, said the IAAS report. Forty-seven percent of Indian-Americans believed that India is headed in the right direction, a 10 percentage point increase from four years ago.The same share approved of Modi's prime ministerial performance. Four in ten respondents said that India’s 2024 election made the country more democratic.Forty-seven percent of respondents felt India is politically on the right track, 32 percent felt it is on the wrong track, and 21 percent cannot say.These numbers represent a significant shift from the 2020 IAAS. Four years ago, respondents’ assessments were markedly more pessimistic, with 36 percent believing India was on the right track and 39 percent reporting it was on the wrong track.The survey also asked about Indian-Americans’ views of India’s current policy direction.Forty-six percent of respondents report that they are either strongly or somewhat supportive of the present government’s policies.Thirty-six percent report they are somewhat or strongly critical of the government’s policies. Eighteen percent express no opinion. These numbers are broadly in line with respondents’ “right track/wrong track” assessments.As per the report, one possible explanation for the relatively more bullish assessment of India in 2024 is that respondents were heartened by the results of the 2024 election, which resulted in a more evenly divided Parliament and greater dispersion of political power. Indeed, some observers interpreted the result of India’s 2024 general election as giving a fillip to democracy since the outcome produced a coalition government and more robust opposition in Parliament.Four in ten members of the Indian American diaspora agree with this sentiment. Forty-one percent of respondents said the 2024 election made India much or somewhat more democratic. On the other hand, 28 percent took the opposite view — that India is much or somewhat less democratic in the aftermath of the general election. Fourteen percent of all respondents did not view the 2024 election as changing India’s democratic character in either direction.The BJP remains the most popular party among Indian-Americans, with 28 percent of respondents identifying with the party.Twenty percent identified with the Congress party, and just 1 percent identified with a third party. In the 2020 IAAS, 32 percent of respondents supported the BJP, 12 percent supported the Congress, and 11 percent identified with a third party.The data suggest that the BJP remains the diaspora’s favored party, but the gap with the Congress, has narrowed compared to 2020.The survey further found that 47 percent of respondents approve of PM Modi’s job in office (36 percent strongly approve and 11 percent approve), while 34 percent disapprove (23 percent strongly disapprove and 11 percent disapprove). An additional 19 percent express no opinion either way.PM Modi’s approval ratings among the diaspora have not budged much in four years. In 2020, 50 percent approved of the job PM Modi was doing (35 percent strongly approved and 15 percent approved) and 31 percent disapproved (22 percent strongly disapproved and 9 percent disapproved).",The 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) was conducted before the US presidential election results. Indian-Americans rate the Joe Biden administration's record on India slightly better than the first Trump administration. Four in ten respondents said that India’s 2024 election made the country more democratic.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119111358,imgsize-1653899,width-400,resizemode-4/119111358.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave, which is located in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Fadnavis's remark came amid growing demand from a certain section to remove the Mughal emperor's grave.""It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra Fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave.

Background of the case

NEW DELHI: The bail plea of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who is currently in judicial custody over her alleged involvement in a high-profile gold smuggling case , has been adjourned to March 19.The Sessions Court, which was set to hear her petition on March 17, has directed the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to file its objections by the next hearing. Further proceedings will continue once the objections are submitted.Ranya Rao had earlier filed a bail application before the Special Court for Economic Offences, which was rejected due to the serious nature of the allegations against her.Following this, her legal team moved to the Sessions Court in an attempt to secure her release.The case has attracted widespread attention due to its scale and the alleged involvement of influential individuals.Ranya Rao was arrested on March 3, 2025, at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport after DRI officials intercepted her carrying gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore . Investigations revealed that she had travelled to Dubai 27 times since January 2025. A subsequent search at her residence led to the discovery of additional gold jewellery valued at Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash.The case took a dramatic turn when it emerged that Ranya allegedly used a State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security checks at the airport. She is the stepdaughter of Karnataka Director General of Police (DGP) Ramchandra Rao, raising concerns over potential police involvement.However, the DGP has distanced himself from the controversy, stating that he had no knowledge of her alleged activities and had been estranged from her since her marriage.Ranya has claimed that she was assaulted and forced to sign documents by DRI officials, allegations that have intensified the legal battle. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal has alleged the involvement of state ministers in the smuggling network, promising to expose them in the Karnataka Assembly.Adding to the complexity, the Karnataka High Court has extended its interim order preventing the DRI from taking immediate action against Ranya's husband, Jatin Vijaykumar Hukkeri, who has also been detained in connection with the case.The court has granted the DRI additional time to file its objections.","Ranya Rao was arrested on March 3, 2025, at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport.

Newly appointed US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday revealed the profound impact of the Bhagavad Gita on her life and career. Gabbard, who has been a long-time admirer of the ancient Hindu text, emphasised how Lord Krishna's teachings to Arjuna have been a source of strength and guidance for her, whether in the midst of war zones or facing the complex challenges of her current role.In an interview with ANI, Gabbard said: ""Whether serving in war zones in different parts of the world or the challenges that we face now, it is (Lord) Krishna's teachings to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that I turn to in the best of times and the worst of times.""Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has often talked about her deep connection with the Bhagavad Gita.In 2020, she urged Hindu students to explore the concepts of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga as outlined in the Gita, emphasiding the importance of service to society as a path to true success. Her daily practice includes meditation, yoga, and reading the Gita.Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation trip, also emphasised the importance of direct dialogue between India and the United States on tariff issues.Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the think-tank Observer Research Foundation's annual Raisina Dialogues in Delhi, she highlighted opportunities to strengthen economic ties between the two nations.Gabbard noted that conversations with Indian officials revealed optimism about enhancing economic relations.""There is significant potential for strengthening our economic partnership. It’s encouraging to see a more positive outlook on this issue rather than focusing solely on tariffs,"" she said, acknowledging that both PM Narendra Modi and President Trump are prioritising their respective nations' economic interests but are also working towards mutually beneficial solutions.""What I have heard from the Indian government officials that I've spoken to over the last few days, there is an opportunity here to see. There is more potential for strengthening of our economic relationship and I'm glad to see that they're looking at it in a more positive light than just one that is focused in a negative way, when we look at tariffs. Obviously Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interest of India's economy and the opportunities available for the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the United States, our economic interests and the interests of the American people "" she added.Gabbar also praised the leadership of PM Modi and Trump, describing them as pragmatic leaders seeking effective solutions. Gabbard pointed out that high-level dialogues, along with discussions among cabinet members and secretaries, are crucial for charting a forward path. She also expressed excitement about the private sector's keen interest in fostering bilateral economic engagement.""What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders who have common sense and who are looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is happening at the very top in both of our countries, but also at the different secretaries and the cabinet members is going to be key to lay down what that path forward really looks like. And I personally am excited because there's keen interest in the private sector here in India and in the United States,"" she said.Additionally, Gabbard highlighted the strong personal rapport between PM Modi and Trump as a solid foundation for deepening the US-India partnership. She referred to PM Modi's earlier visit to the White House as instrumental in setting a collaborative tone for future engagements.Reflecting on her meetings with Indian officials, Gabbard underscored the broad scope of cooperation, spanning intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She concluded by expressing optimism about the immense opportunities available for advancing the US-India relationship across multiple domains.""The tone and the relationship with our new administration under President Trump and Prime Minister Modi was set during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House. As you know, they are already good friends. It was a very great opportunity for them to share their joint vision for the US-India partnership and the opportunity for us to continue to strengthen that partnership,"" she said.""The meetings that I've had here with different Indian government officials and intelligence officials really is set on that foundation of how we can continue to integrate, how we can continue to strengthen our relationship, not only of course in my area of intelligence, but we're looking at commerce and trade and defense and education. There's nothing but opportunity that I see here in the US-India partnership,"" she added.","Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has often talked about her deep connection with the Bhagavad Gita.

Denying bail in less serious offences unfortunate: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/denying-bail-in-less-serious-offences-unfortunate-supreme-court/articleshow/119135920.cms,"Twenty years ago, bail cases did not even reach HCs: Supreme Court



NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over courts denying bail in not very serious cases despite probe being completed, Supreme Court on Monday said it is unfortunate that relief is not being granted in such cases and the apex court has to intervene.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that 20 years ago, bail plea in such cases did not even reach HCs. It is shocking that the apex court is adjudicating such cases and it is flooded with such petitions, it said.SC has repeatedly flagged the issue and appealed to trial courts and HCs to be liberal in granting bail, particularly in not serious and petty offences. It had earlier expressed anguish over ""intellectual dishonesty"" by lower courts & HCs in continuously denying bail to accused in cases involving ordinary infractions, despite its various orders exhorting them to be liberal in granting bail when custody is not needed.While granting bail to an accused who had been in custody for over two years in a cheating case, the bench said, ""It is unfortunate that bail matters in cases triable by magistrate come to SC for bail... We are sorry to say that people are not getting bail... It is unfortunate"". SC noted that the bail plea of the accused was rejected by a trial court and Gujarat HC, despite probe in the case completed and a chargesheet filed.Flagging the issue of SC being flooded by bail petitions as accused were coming to it for the relief, the bench said, ""It is shocking that SC has to deal with such cases. Twenty years ago, such cases did not come to HCs but now it is SC, which is deciding such cases.""Observing that in a democracy there was no place for a police state where probe agencies can arrest people unnecessarily and in a mechanical way, SC in 2022 put a curb on agencies from arresting people in cognisable offences punishable up to 7 years' jail term, where custody is not needed, & had asked criminal courts to protect the liberty of people and be liberal in granting bail.It held that the accused, who was not arrested during probe and had cooperated in the investigation, should not be taken into custody after chargesheet had been filed. It had also appealed to Centre to frame a new law to streamline the process of granting bail, saying there was ""pressing need"" for it, and ruled that regular bail application of an accused had to be decided normally within two weeks and anticipatory bail within six weeks.""Courts tend to think that the possibility of a conviction being nearer to rarity, bail applications will have to be decided strictly, contrary to legal principles,"" court had said.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that 20 years ago, bail plea in such cases did not even reach HCs.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

""During TMC chief Banerjee's tenure, there were 395 accidents and derailments, and when Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge was railway minister, the number of accidents and derailments were 38,"" he said.""Where there was once an average of one accident per day, today the number has been reduced to just 30 accidents per year.

Though Lalu Prasad had announced setting up of the factory, it remained ""inactive"" and work began only after PM Narendra Modi came to office, the railway minister said.'Made in Bihar' locomotives will soon be reaching destinations across the world, he said. Reading out the list of countries importing trains and locomotives from India, he said while metro coaches are being exported to Australia, train bogies are being shipped to UK, Saudi Arabia, France and Australia.

Telangana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-banks-on-door-to-door-survey-data-to-build-quota-case/articleshow/119135043.cms,"T'gana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case





HYDERABAD: An eight-hour reservation debate in the Telangana assembly on Monday culminated in the passage of two landmark bills that aim to extend the quantum of reservation in education , govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%, breaching Supreme Court's cap on quotas.CM A Revanth Reddy showcased political unanimity in passing the bills - BRS, BJP, AIMIM and CPI backed the move - as a sign that the state's reservation framework deserved to be enshrined with a constitutional amendment during the ongoing session of Parliament.The first of the proposed laws - Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 - proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs, up from the existing 29% for BCs, 15% for SCs and 6% for STs.Telangana Backward Classes (reservation of seats in rural and urban local bodies) Bill 2025 extends the 42% BC quota to rural and urban local bodies. Before this, BC reservation in local bodies ranged from 18% to 23%, depending on population of each municipality or panchayat.Revanth put his hand up to lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi and other senior MPs to press for the proposed constitutional amendment. He said empirical data from a door-to-door survey by state govt would drive this amendment. The data, which includes information on BCs, SCs, and STs, is being presented as a bulletproof argument for exceeding the 50% cap on reservations, a step Supreme Court had indicated could be considered if the numbers backed it.Speaker Gaddam Prasad Kumar said the initial plan was to earmark 15% for SCs, which was increased to 18% based on a suggestion by AIMIM's Akbaruddin Owaisi. But the House rejected three amendments proposed by BRS. These called for a 42% quota for BCs in all govt contracts, creation of a BC sub-plan similar to those for SCs and STs, and a Rs 20,000-crore allocation for BC welfare in the upcoming budget.Revanth, along with deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka and BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar, expressed confidence that a constitutional amendment was a matter of time. Prabhakar urged all political parties to set aside their differences to institutionalise the 42% BC quota, drawing inspiration from Tamil Nadu's success in securing similar reservation for them through bipartisan support.The assembly also discussed Telangana Scheduled Castes (rationalisation of reservations) Bill, which deals with the sub-classification of SCs. It will be debated on Tuesday before being sent to the governor for approval. Supreme Court has empowered states to sub-classify SCs.Revanth informed the House that the erstwhile BRS govt had sent a proposal to Centre for 37% BC reservation. He said Congress govt would withdraw that proposal and send a new one for 42% reservation as the two proposals couldn't coexist.","Two landmark bills aim to extend quantum of reservation in education, govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%.

In addition to joint exercises, training and port visits, a roadmap for bilateral defence industry collaboration will be developed, he said.With an eye on China, the PM also said in his media statement after the meeting that India believed in the policy of development and not expansionism. Presence of Khalistani separatists in the Five Eyes, English-speaking countries that share an intelligence alliance, and their efforts to hurt Indian interests remain a major concern for India. After raising that issue, Modi took Luxon to Rakabganj Gurdwara for a tour of the Sikh shrine.PM Modi said both sides would continue to cooperate in combating terrorist, separatist and extremist elements. He said India had shared its concerns about anti-India activities by certain illegal elements in New Zealand. ""We're confident that we will continue to receive full cooperation of New Zealand govt against such illegal elements,"" he said. ""We stand united against terrorism. Whether it is Christchurch terrorist attack of March 15, 2019, or Mumbai attack of Nov 26, 2008, terrorism in any form is unacceptable.

""Mutual cooperation and investment shall be encouraged in fields such as dairy, food processing and pharma. We have given priority to mutual cooperation in the areas of renewable energy and critical minerals,"" the PM said. ""Indian community living in New Zealand is making a valuable contribution to the country's social and economic development.

New Zealand joined India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative. Luxon strongly reiterated New Zealand's support for a permanent seat for India in a reformed UN Security Council both in the meeting with Modi, and also while speaking as the guest of honour at the Raisina Dialogue.Both endorsed increasing defence engagements, including through participation in military exercises, staff college exchanges, regular port calls by naval ships, and exchange of high-level defence delegations.

""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates ,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years. A similar mechanism was laid down for appointment of ED director.In 2023, SC had detected a vacuum in the law for appointment of CEC and ruled that CEC and ECs would be selected by a panel comprising PM, CJI and LoP.

NAGPUR: Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad spiralled into chaos, leaving dozens wounded and causing widespread destruction.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen suffered serious wounds in the unrest, while a constable remains in critical condition in hospital. Mobs torched two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces struggled to contain the violence. Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs. DCPs Archit Chandak and Niketan Kadam were wounded while attempting to control the crowds. Firefighters were also caught in the crossfire as they tried to extinguish burning vehicles. Several neighbourhoods remained tense as sporadic violence continued.Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal deployed more than 1,000 officers and imposed prohibitory orders in Mahal, Chitnis Park Chowk and Bhaldarpura, restricting movement in the most sensitive areas. Key roads were sealed off. Reinforcements and intelligence teams worked to prevent further escalation. However, sporadic stone-throwing continued into the night.Police deployed surveillance teams with CCTV-equipped vehicles and public address systems to monitor the situation and issue warnings. Authorities also activated local peace committees, urging community leaders to intervene and defuse tensions.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari appealed for calm. ""Nagpur has always been a peaceful city where people coexist in harmony. I urge citizens not to believe rumours and cooperate with law enforcement,"" Fadnavis said. Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule visited the affected areas.Central Nagpur MLA Pravin Datke alleged that ""outsiders"" were brought in to incite violence. ""We have instructed police to identify and take strict action against those responsible,"" he said in Mumbai. In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, where Aurangzeb's tomb is located, VHP and Bajrang Dal staged protests. Protesters warned of the tomb's demolition if govt failed to act.VHP hinted at escalating their agitation across Marathwada and other districts if demands are not met.","Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb.

"Ajit Pawar admits Ladki funds went to well-off too, vows to 'fix' it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajit-pawar-admits-ladki-funds-went-to-well-off-too-vows-to-fix-it/articleshow/119134047.cms,"Ajit Pawar (File photo)

MUMBAI: Indicating a tighter scrutiny of Mahayuti government's flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana , deputy CM Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, on Monday admitted in the state assembly that beneficiaries who were financially well-off also received the stipend, and now the scheme will be ""corrected"" to only cover poor women.""In hurry and confusion, some sisters with a good economic condition got included in the list. The scheme is meant only for women from poor families,"" said Ajit. ""Sometimes, once a scheme is introduced, it needs corrections. We will be making corrections. But we will not take back the money from those who received it.""He pointed out that even PM Narendra Modi appealed to the public to exit central schemes if they no longer fit the criteria. He emphasised that the scheme would not be shut down. ""We will provide enough funds for the scheme & poor women will 100% receive the money,"" he added.He also confirmed reports that a portion of over 40% hike in the annual plan for SCs and STs outlay in the annual plan would be used for Ladki Bahin scheme. Social justice minister Sanjay Shirsat alleged that nearly Rs 10,000 crore from the social justice and tribal welfare department was diverted to Ladki Bahin scheme. ""In the annual plan, allocation for SC component has risen 42% and tribal component by 40%. Even after excluding Ladki Bahin outlay, the rise is 18% and 19%,"" Ajit told the assembly.He further said Ladki Bahin scheme could be linked to loan programmes given the enormous quantum of Rs 45,000 crore that it placed in the hands of women.""The Mumbai bank, led by BJP MLC Pravin Darekar, has already announced that those who open their Ladki Bahin accounts there will be eligible for a loan of Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000,"" the deputy CM said.He defended government's Rs 9.3 lakh crore debt and revenue deficit of Rs 45,892 crore, by saying this was within the fiscal limit. ""Only Maharashtra, Odisha, and Gujarat have managed to keep these parameters within the fiscal limit,"" he said. He said the fiscal deficit was less than 3% of GSDP and the loan was less than 25% of GSDP. RBI's risk analysis concluded that Maharashtra had healthy fiscal indicators, he added.He further said government focused on infrastructure schemes, like Wadhawan port project where it was considering building an airport. ""Some countries have built an airport in the sea. Such ideas are worth considering if it does not impact the environment.""","Deputy CM Ajit Pawar admitted in the state assembly that beneficiaries who were financially well-off also received the stipend.

ISI under fire after IED blast kills cleric known for criticism of Pakistani state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isi-under-fire-after-ied-blast-kills-cleric-known-for-criticism-of-pakistani-state/articleshow/119133650.cms,"New militant group puts Pak forces on notice, identifies them as primary target



NEW DELHI: The ISI has come under fire after firebrand cleric Mufti Munir Shakir , a known critic of the Pak state was killed in an IED attack in Peshawar two days ago. At his funeral, Mufti's son directly blamed Pakistani intelligence for his death and thousands chanted slogans against the military and the Pak army, accusing them of targeting Pashtuns .A video of the funeral surfaced on X on Monday showing the funeral ground echoing with slogans like ""Yeh Col, General...dehshatgard...Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai iske piche vardi hai... (These Colonels, Generals are terrorists; uniforms are backing this terrorism) ""A statement from the Peshawar police spokesperson had earlier said that Shakir was injured on his left foot in a blast that took place in the vicinity of Urmur Police Station on March 15. A case was registered at the Counter Terrorism Department police station against 'unknown militants'.Sources said that an improvised explosive device (IED), containing approximately 600 grams of explosives, was planted near the gate of a mosque and detonated as Mufti Shakir entered the premises.Video footage at the time of the explosion shows he was accompanied by two others at the time of the blast.Known for using FM radio to propagate his thoughts, Mufti Munir Shakir had in the past often called out the Pakistani establishment for misusing Islam for their own gains.Shakir had founded a rebel outfit named Lashkar-e-Islam in 2004, in Bara, Khyber district and had ties to the Deobandi sub-sect Panjpiri besides being associated with an organisation ""Ishaat-e-Tauheed"".In what could worsen Pakistan's internal security challenge, a new militant group, Harqat Inqilab Islami Pakistan (IIP), announced its presence in Pakistan on Monday with group's leader, Ghazi Shahabuddin, releasing a eight-minute video, surrounded by dozens of masked and armed militants, identifying Pakistani security forces as their primary target, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Shahabuddin declared that it would focus its operations in Pakistan and was open to collaborating with other militant groups in the region. Sources here said that the outfit is likely an al-Qaida offshoot which has been on an offensive against Pakistan. The move comes weeks after another new militant group, Jaish-e-Umari, emerged in north Waziristan claiming to have the backing of over 1,000 fighters.","Firebrand cleric Mufti Munir Shakir was killed in an IED attack in Peshawar.

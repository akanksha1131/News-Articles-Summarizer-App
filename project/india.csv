'Business-like approach unlikely to succeed': India cautions UNGA over Afghanistan; abstains on draft resolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-cautions-against-business-like-approach-for-afghanistan-abstains-in-unga-draft-resolution-passed/articleshow/122309439.cms,"India's UN envoy P Harish (File Photo)

India on Monday abstained in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on a draft resolution on Afghanistan, with its envoy to the UN noting that a “business as usual” approach is unlikely to deliver outcomes which the global community envisions for the Afghan people.The UNGA adopted the Germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the Asian nation. It was passed with 116 votes in favour; two against and 12 abstentions, including India.Explaining the decision, the country's UN Permanent Representative P Harish said, ""Any coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must combine a mix of policy instruments – incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions. A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people. ""The diplomat added that no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since August 2021, when the Taliban again took over the reins in Kabul.“An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed.The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts,” Harish asserted.Further, he stressed that New Delhi is ""closely monitoring"" the security situation in Afghanistan, and underscored that the international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities - a veiled reference to Pakistan.Reiterating India’s historic ties with the people of Afghanistan and its enduring commitment to meeting their humanitarian and developmental needs, he stated that while New Delhi remains committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly supports the international community’s efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, “India has decided to abstain on this resolution. ”","The UNGA adopted the Germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the Asian nation.

Defense manufacturing can drive India's rise as global power: Ram Madhav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defense-manufacturing-can-drive-indias-rise-as-global-power-ram-madhav/articleshow/122309558.cms,"Ram Madhav (File photo)

In your new book, 'The New World: 21st Century Global Order and Bharat', you speak about a global churn. What is the biggest priority for India in this new world order?

Ram Madhav:

What will drive national growth in this new environment?

Madhav:

What about defense manufacturing?

Madhav:

You spoke of building “Brand Bharat.” What does that entail?

Madhav:

You’ve also used the term ‘dharmocracy’. Can you explain that?

Madhav:

Can foreign universities in India help promote Brand Bharat?

Madhav:

RSS is entering its 100th year. What is the vision going forward?

Madhav:

You have worked extensively in the Northeast. What explains the political shift there?

Madhav:

And RSS's role there?

Madhav:

In a wide-ranging conversation with the Times of India, Ram Madhav , senior RSS member, outlines the strategic reorientation India must undertake to navigate a changing global order. From foreign policy to technology, economic growth to ideological values, and the Northeast to dharmocracy, Madhav, who also heads the think tank India Foundation, reflects on India's opportunities and challenges in the coming decades.There is a big churn happening globally. The world is heading towards a completely different order after seven decades of a certain kind of geopolitical atmosphere. When you're confronted with a new order, you must shed some of the old habits and practices. I often cite Mao's infamous Cultural Revolution — not to endorse it, but as a metaphor. You need to think afresh.Historically, Indians have been very comfortable looking West — towards Europe and America. We do have strong ties with them. But a shift began with Narasimha Rao and taken further by Vajpayee through the Look East policy, which Modi upgraded to Act East. However, we still remain predominantly westward-facing. Meanwhile, the entire Eurasian region is in turmoil — the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Gaza-Israel tensions, and the Iran-Israel-US confrontation. These conflicts may end, but their impact will last for decades. In such a scenario, India must turn to its immediate and extended neighbourhood — Southeast Asia, ASEAN, and then the Global South, including Africa and Latin America.In the past, trade — especially in goods — powered national growth. Now, it will be technology. Prime Minister Modi has rightly focused on this with initiatives like the National Research Foundation and an emphasis on areas like quantum technology. But we still have a lot of ground to cover. Domestically, we must prioritise the economy over the next 20 years — something like what Bill Clinton famously said: “It’s the economy, stupid. ”Take China — between 1980 and 2000, it focused solely on economic growth. Deng Xiaoping even put communism on hold to prioritise economic development. India must aim for sustained 9–10% growth. The current 8% is good, but we must aspire for more.That’s a massive opportunity. Everyone talks about India's weakness in manufacturing, and it's true. But manufacturing has saturated globally, defense manufacturing has huge potential. India itself is a major consumer of defense equipment. Given the current global war-like environment, every nation is ramping up its defense. This is a golden opportunity not just for ‘Make in India’ but ‘Make for the World’. That’s where we can become a manufacturing powerhouse.In the outgoing world order — post-World War II — Western powers created institutions aligned with their interests and were able to set their agenda. But today, the West is no longer in a position to dictate the global agenda. If India doesn’t take a proactive role, others like China will. India must assert itself not just as an economic and technological power, but also ideologically.Democracy is one such idea. The Chinese model offers economic freedom but not political freedom. Ours is different — full freedoms, rooted in pluralism, respect for sovereignty, patriotism, and sustainability. These are values India must articulate. Take yoga — that’s one idea we gave to the world. The last profound political idea from India was Gandhi’s non-violence. We must now think of the next idea. That’s what I mean by Brand Bharat.Democracy, in its Western sense, often equates to majoritarianism — majority wins, period. In a dharmocracy, the majority may form a government, but governance must be through consensus. Gandhi’s idea of Ram Rajya was not a theocracy — it was a model where the weakest had as much power as the strongest. Deendayal Upadhyaya also said that elections are majoritarian, but governance must be consensus-driven. That’s the Indian model — dharmocracy.Absolutely. Earlier, foreign dignitaries visiting India were taken to Qutub Minar or Red Fort — symbols of our subjugation. Today, they also visit temples, attend Ganga Aarti. That’s our civilizational identity. But we can build up on that. With nearly 100 foreign institutions now allowed to open campuses in India, they will engage with India from the inside. However, they will mostly teach Indian students. So our education system must consciously integrate Brand Bharat thinking.Formal centenary celebrations begin in October. The Sarsanghchalak will share the vision then. But as someone associated with RSS for decades, I can say this: it’s a unique organisation. In 100 years, there has been no split, no dissidence, no weakening — only growth. It's entirely voluntary. No one is paid. It’s run by those who see it as a duty.Its openness, adaptability, and relevance in every era are its strengths. Whether during the 1962 war, the Emergency, or the Ram Janmabhoomi movement — RSS remained central to India’s national life. It is an organisation that deserves academic study in itself.I don’t believe in right-left binaries. But yes, the rise of BJP and nationalist sentiments in the Northeast, especially in the last 10 years, has brought emotional integration with the rest of India. Earlier, people there felt Delhi was another country. That has changed. Under PM Modi, every week a minister visited some state. This continuous engagement built a sense of belonging.When we contested in Nagaland in 2017, even in remote villages, BJP flags were seen. We won 12 out of 20 seats we contested. Such change signals, besides representing BJP’s appeal, a deep emotional integration.RSS has worked there under extremely difficult conditions. Cadres were kidnapped, tortured, even killed. Yet they went from across India — from Kerala, Maharashtra — to serve those areas, often with no knowledge of local languages or familiarity of food habits. Organisations like Vivekananda Kendra and Ramakrishna Mission played vital roles in tribal education and cultural pride.Today, Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, communicates in Hindi. That wasn’t imposed — it evolved naturally due to years of engagement. That silent foundational work held the region together in its most fragile times.","Senior RSS member Ram Madhav outlines the strategic reorientation India must undertake to navigate a changing global order.

Voter roll revision: What is special intensive revision of Bihar voter list and what's the controversy - Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voter-roll-revision-what-is-special-intensive-revision-of-bihar-voter-list-and-whats-the-controversy-explained/articleshow/122308956.cms,"Representative image

Why the revision?

Migrants need not panic

Why not Aadhaar, MGNREGA or ration cards?

Documents accepted eligible voters may submit any of the following

Govt-issued pension order Pre1987 official document from any govt or PSU Birth certificate Passport matriculation orother school certificates Permanent residence certificate Forest rights certificate Caste certificate NRC (where available) Family register from local authorities Land or house allotment certificate from govt agencies

Oppn demands & concerns

EC response

A special revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls has triggered political friction before this year’s assembly elections, with opposition parties questioning the document requirements and timing. Supreme Court will hear petitions on July 10 challenging EC’s decision to carry out the exercise in the poll-bound state .EC says the special intensive revision (SIR) aims to eliminate duplicate and bogus voters, especially those listed both at permanent and current addresses. EC insists that only residents currently living in an area should be on its voter rolls, in accordance with constitutional norms ensuring that only Indian citizens can vote. The exercise, last conducted in 2003, targets updated enrolment and removal of ineligible entries. Bihar currently has around 7.9 crore registered voters.Millions of Bihar residents have migrated elsewhere for work or education but remain enrolled in their native constituencies. EC clarifies that names already in the 2003 electoral rolls — available at https:// voters.eci.gov.in — or of their descendants need no documentary proof of ancestry when submitting the fresh enumeration forms being distributed by boothlevel officers.EC excludes Aadhaar, ration, and MGNREGA cards from valid proof, citing concerns that illegal immigrants, especially from Bangladesh, may have obtained these documents. Govt fears such entries in border regions like Seemanchal, near Bengal and Nepal. Aadhaar-based documents are seen as vulnerable to misuse and suspected foreigners flagged by officials can be referred under Citizenship Act.Opposition parties argue that most accepted documents require Aadhaar-based verification. They also cite the 2011 socio-economic census showing that 65.58% of rural households in Bihar own no land - making land-linked documents inaccessible to many . Critics say the short deadline - less than a month - is insufficient, especially for those lacking birth or school certificates.CEC Gyanesh Kumar said the process would ensure inclusion of all eligible voters. EC clarified that if documents are found lacking after the draft rolls are published on Aug 1, voters will have another opportunity to submit them during the scrutiny phase.","EC excludes Aadhar, ration, and MGNREGA cards from valid proof.

ICAI CA May 2025 Results: An overview

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has announced the CA May 2025 results for Foundation, Intermediate, and Final exams today, July 6. This year, Rajan Kabra from Mumbai has emerged as the CA Final topper with an AIR 1, and an impressive score of 516 out of 600.At a time when test prep culture often celebrates rote learning and relentless grind, Rajan Kabra’s story stands out for its clarity, curiosity, and quiet confidence. But behind the score is a journey shaped by questions, not just answers, but by interests that range from balance sheets to, and a mindset that values the process as much as the prize.This isn’t Rajan’s first moment in the spotlight. He topped the CA Intermediate exams in May 2022 with AIR 1 and had earlier scored 378 out of 400 in CA Foundation (July 2021). Each stage of his journey has reflected discipline, focused preparation, and a calm, grounded mindset.Also See: ICAI CA May 2025 Toppers check list of top scorers in CA Foundation, Inter, and Final exams here Rather than being driven purely by competition, Rajan’s consistent performance has stemmed from a genuine sense of curiosity and a steady approach, even under the intense pressure of the CA course.Rajan has taken on a role as an industrial trainee at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), where he is developing his strategic thinking abilities through real-world business experience.His learning approach emphasizes practical, hands-on experience rather than purely theoretical studies. The position at BCG provides him with direct exposure to business challenges in an industry setting.Beyond his academic and professional pursuits, Rajan identifies as a cheerful and curious individual with a deep love for fiction, especially the Harry Potter series. He has also been an active participant in debates, quizzes, extempores, and elocutions throughout his school and college years, showcasing his confidence and communication skills.In recent years, Rajan has developed a strong interest in geopolitics and global finance - fields that bridge the gap between numbers, policies, and real-world impact. He views these subjects as essential to understanding the broader context of financial decision-making. For him, learning is not limited to achieving ranks or results; it is a continuous process rooted in growth, awareness, and intellectual curiosity.The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has announced the CA May 2025 results for Foundation, Intermediate, and Final exams. Rajan Kabra secured AIR 1 in the CA Final with 516/600 marks, followed by Nishtha Bothra and Manav Rakesh Shah.

NEW DELHI: Several areas of Delhi experienced rainfall on Monday morning, bringing much-needed relief from the hot and humid weather that had gripped the city over the past few days.The rain began early, with low-hanging clouds blanketing the skies across the capital. The showers helped lower temperatures and ease the lingering humidity.However, the persistent rain also led to waterlogging in some parts of the city, including the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Vehicles were seen navigating through the flooded streets, causing traffic disruptions in affected areas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.The advisory covers north, north-east, north-west, south, south-west, south-east, and west Delhi, where storm activity is expected today.As of now, no weather alerts have been issued for the coming days.In a press statement released on July 6, IMD Delhi said, “Generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain with thunderstorm/lightning likely in the next 48 hours.”Earlier on Sunday morning, parts of Delhi experienced rainfall.The IMD also noted that the monsoon trough at mean sea level currently stretches from Suratgarh, Sirsa, Delhi, Lucknow, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Bankura, Digha, and extends southeastward to the northeast Bay of Bengal. Additionally, an upper-air cyclonic circulation has formed over Himachal Pradesh and adjoining Punjab at approximately 1.5 km above sea level.In light of the weather conditions, Delhi airport issued a passenger advisory at 06:51 hours, urging travelers to use the metro or other public transport options to reach the airport.Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh continues to reel under a severe monsoon spell, with the cumulative death toll reaching 75. This includes 45 fatalities directly linked to rain and 30 accidental deaths caused by road mishaps, electrocution, and even a gas cylinder blast, as per data from the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC).","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.

Holidays offer both fun and learning opportunities

As schools across India reopen after the long summer break, students step into the new academic session in July 2025 with excitement, fresh books, new classrooms, and a sense of renewed enthusiasm. Along with the resumption of the school routine, July also brings a series of upcoming holidays and celebrations. It’s a month filled with opportunities—not just to study, but also to enjoy breaks, explore new interests, learn new skills, and spend quality time with family and friends.Questions are emerging about whether July 7, 2025, will be declared a holiday due to its coincidence with Muharram, a significant Islamic festival celebrated across various parts of the country. The month's calendar already includes regular Sunday breaks and various regional holidays, potentially affecting school schedules. The timing of these observances, which include both national and international events, could have implications for academic calendars and educational planning. .According to the school calendar for July 2025, Muharram is expected to fall on Monday, July 7, 2025.On this day, many schools across different Indian states are likely to remain closed. However, the final declaration of holiday may vary from state to state depending on local government guidelines.In addition to Muharram, some regions may also observe monsoon or rain-related holidays between July 10 and 15, particularly in areas that are prone to heavy rainfall. These local closures are typically declared by district administrations to ensure student safety during adverse weather conditions. Students will also benefit from four regular Sunday holidays this month.Apart from school holidays, several important national and international observances fall within this month. These include:• July 1 – National Doctor’s Day• July 6 – World Zoonoses Day• July 10 – Bakrid / Eid-ul-Azha• July 11 – World Population Day• July 15 – World Youth Skills Day• July 18 – Nelson Mandela International Day• July 22 – Chandrayaan-2 Launch Day (commemoration)• July 26 – Kargil Vijay Diwas• July 28 – World Hepatitis Day• July 29 – International Tiger DayWhile holidays are a welcome break from academics, they also provide a chance for students to pursue new skills. This year, children are showing interest in short-term courses like storytelling, painting, robotics, and coding. The monsoon, fresh beginnings, and the joy of learning make July a truly memorable month for school children.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

PUNE: Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said on Sunday that a fake narrative about the city's ""collapsing law and order"" situation was being built based on an ""entirely false and misleading complaint of a very serious nature"" authorities had received recently.Kumar did not specify the nature of the complaint while speaking at the inauguration of a new police chowkey under the Sinhagad Road police station. However, his observation came against the backdrop of a 22-year-old woman's complaint that an unidentified delivery agent entered her 11th-floor flat in Pune last Wednesday, sprayed some chemical to render her unconscious, and raped her. She had also alleged that the man used her cellphone to take a selfie and keyed in a threat message, ‘I will come back'.Also read: Top cop says 22-year-old woman filed false complaint; tried to portray city as unsafe ""However, our teams busted the same within 24 hours by establishing that the complaint given by the woman was entirely false and misleading and tended to hide information from police,"" Kumar told TOI later.He added: ""There is a part of consent in the case, and this consent we have already established.

This was also after she and her friend were made to sit in front of each other and questioned. She has also been referred to counselling. Referring to these events as ""a very serious complaint"" received by the authorities, Kumar noted that a fake narrative was being constructed, one alleging that Pune's law and order systems were ""collapsing"".Officials from Kondhwa police on Saturday also recorded the statement of a woman professor with a private engineering college who was in touch with the woman before the registration of the rape complaint, they said.""The professor is the complainant's friend and guide and was in touch with the complainant on Wednesday.

BENGALURU: The Indo-Russian joint venture (JV) to manufacture 200 Kamov helicopters in India has remained in limbo as the Ukraine war, Western sanctions on Russia, and post-Covid supply chain disruptions have hampered its progress.India and Russia signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement in 2015.

"Plane on runway, incoming SWISS flight safely executes last-minute go-around at IGIA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plane-on-runway-incoming-swiss-flight-safely-executes-last-minute-go-around-at-igia/articleshow/122305066.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The alertness of Delhi air traffic control (ATC) and pilots operating a SWISS flight to IGIA late Sunday (July 6) saved the day when another aircraft ahead of the European airliner first slowed down in air and then didn't vacate the runway from the first available rapid exit taxiway. As a result, the spacing between the two arriving aircraft in air reduced from the four nautical miles that was being maintained by ATC at that time and then the other plane was on the runway for 25-30 seconds longer than it should have. The ATC asked pilots of the SWISS Airbus A330 to go around when it was at an altitude of about 1,400 feet and it then landed safely in the second attempt.This happened after 11.40 pm on Sunday when SWISS LX 146 was flying in from Zurich and an Indian carrier’s A320 from Phuket was ahead of it in the sequence of landing. According to senior ATC officials, the aircraft flying in from Phuket was “four nautical miles (NM) from touchdown on runway 11R and LX 146 behind it was about eight NM from touchdown. The other aircraft reduced speed on final approach. Subsequently, Swiss was also asked to reduce speed to minimum speed by the approach controller. ”ATC asked the SWISS flight to “continue approach” because even this slightly reduced horizontal separation would have been enough for it to land had the other plane landed and vacated runway 11R using the first rapid exit taxiway.Made at 120 degrees to the runway, this alignment of the Y1 rapid exit taxiway would have made it possible for the aircraft to vacate the runway on landing roll itself and then LX 146 touching down.“After landing, tower controller (ATC) asked pilot of the other plane to vacate the runway via rapid exit taxiway Y1. But the pilot informed that the aircraft will vacate the runway by Y2, which is further down the runway and farther away from Y1. This resulted in increased runway occupancy time by 25-30 seconds,” said the official.Since this flight could not vacate the runway in time, the tower controller asked the SWISS flight to “go around” or carry out a missed approach for “safety reasons.” Flight tracking sites show the Lufthansa group airliner did so when it was at an altitude of 1,400 feet. It landed safely in its second attempt at 11.51 pm, as per flight tracking sites.At that time, Delhi was witnessing easterly winds — which is a common during monsoon. IGIA’s main runway 10/28 has been closed for repairs since June 15. With three operational runways (minus 10/28) and easterly winds, Delhi can handle a maximum of up to 32 arrivals in an hour. While learning from the fiasco earlier this summer, number of flights has been cut at Delhi. Still ATC and pilots have to be extra careful to operate in circumstances to maximise aircraft movement.“We are operating amid a shortage of experienced manpower. Whether it is Delhi or Mumbai, the crunch situation leaves low margin for error. An aircraft slowing down or taking longer than anticipated to vacate the runway, means quick decisions in real time to ensure safety,” said multiple air traffic controllers.","The alertness of Delhi air traffic control (ATC) and pilots operating a SWISS flight to IGIA late Sunday (July 6) saved the day.

Opposition united in SC on SIR: 'Will snatch votes of lakhs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-united-in-sc-on-sir-will-snatch-votes-of-lakhs/articleshow/122305802.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear challenges by Congress and and 10 other opposition parties, including DMK and NCP (Sharad Pawar), to the Election Commission 's decision for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.Appearing before a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Gopal Sankarnarayanan pleaded to the court to grant an urgent hearing as the revision process had already started and lakhs would be disenfranchised if the exercise was not stayed. They said the squeezed timeline fixed by the EC was impractical and it was impossible to complete the process in such a short span of time. After a brief hearing, the apex court agreed to examine their plea and posted it for Thursday (July 10). Bihar elections are likely to be held in November.The petitions have been filed on behalf of Congress, NCP (Sharad Pawar), CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), DMK, SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), JMM and RJD. Besides, TMC MP Mahua Moitra, NGOs - Association for Democratic Reforms and People's Union for Civil Liberties - and a few residents of Bihar have also filed petitions against the EC's drive.The petitioners took the identical stand that the timeline fixed by EC was not practical and would lead to disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, particularly migrant workers and people from marginalised communities who do not have requisite documents and may not be able to procure it within the short span fixed by EC.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal posted on X: “It (SIR) has wreaked havoc across villages and towns of Bihar — giving crores of voters anxiety about whether their right to vote will be stolen. This is mass-scale rigging and mischief being carried out by EC, under instructions from ruling regime.”RJD MP Manoj Jha sought direction to EC to conduct the forthcoming polls in Bihar on the basis of the existing electoral rolls. Though at present SIR is confined to Bihar, parties apprehend that it could be replicated in other states too. Moitra urged SC to restrain EC for undertaking such an exercise.“The impugned order is discriminatory, unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary and violates Articles 14, 21, 325 and 326. The order is a tool of institutionalised disenfranchisement. It is submitted that it is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor migrant communities, as such, they are not random patterns but it is engineered exclusions. The present SIR process is not only hasty and ill-timed, but has the effect of disenfranchising crores of voters, thereby robbing them of their constitutional right to vote. Moreover, this exercise has been launched during monsoon season in Bihar, when many districts are affected by floods and local population is displaced, thereby making it difficult and almost impossible for a large section of population to meaningfully participate in the process,” Jha said in his plea.Seeking the court’s direction to set aside the EC’s order, Moitra in her petition, filed through advocate Neha Rathi, submitted that the order unlawfully shifted the burden of proving eligibility from the state to the individual elector and arbitrarily excludes commonly accepted identity documents such as Aadhaar and ration cards.PUCL, in its petition through advocate Talha Abdul Rahman, questioned EC’s timing, alleging Bihar’s massive migrant population faces systematic exclusion as workers lacking local address proofs struggle with complex procedures from distant locations, possibly missing compressed timelines due to work commitments.","The Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges by Congress and and 10 other opposition parties, including DMK and NCP (Sharad Pawar), to the Election Commission's decision for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Monday triggered a fierce political row in Maharashtra after warning opponents that “tumko patak patak ke marenge” (we’ll thrash you thoroughly) while responding to MNS chief Raj Thackeray ’s call to target Hindi speakers.Speaking in Guwahati, Dubey told ANI, “You people are surviving on our money. What kind of industries do you have?... If you are courageous enough and beat those who speak Hindi, then you should beat all those who speak Urdu, Tamil, and Telugu. If you are such a big 'boss', come out of Maharashtra, come to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu - 'tumko patak patak ke maarenge'.”""We all respect Marathi and the people of Maharashtra, who fought for India's independence. The BMC election is due, and hence, Raj and Uddhav are doing cheap politics. If they have courage - they should go to Mahim and beat any Hindi or Urdu speaking people in front of Mahim dargah,"" the BJP MP further added.Leading the response was Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray, who accused the BJP of attempting to fracture Maharashtra through divisive rhetoric. “This is exactly the BJP’s mentality, which is anti-Maharashtra,” he told reporters.“We have asked everyone not to react to such crazy and dirty minds because they want to create fear and instability in Maharashtra… This mentality of the BJP’s MP represents the entire BJP; this does not represent North India.”Thackeray stressed that the issue was not between languages but an orchestrated effort by the BJP to inflame tensions for electoral benefit. “People from all over the country come to Maharashtra with dreams and hopes… Our fight is against the government, not against any language,” he said.Criticising Dubey’s remarks as “shameless,” Aaditya added: “Dubey is not the face of North Indians. He represents the BJP… These remarks were made with a political intent to divide Marathi and Hindi-speaking people.”Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe Patil dismissed Dubey’s intervention as ignorant. “He is foolish. This controversy is not about language,” Patil said. “It is about whether two other languages, besides their mother tongue, should be taught to students of Std 1 to 4. The child can get confused… Congress respects all languages but is against diverting from ‘Balmanasshastra’ and confusing children.”NCP-SCP MLA Rohit Pawar accused Dubey of importing poll strategies from Bihar to stir unrest in Maharashtra. “I request Nishikant Dubey ji not to try and implement election strategies specific to Bihar in Maharashtra. While he is thinking of the West Bengal and Bihar elections, he is disturbing the sense of equality in Maharashtra,” he said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also demanded accountability from the state leadership. “Earlier, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar compared Marathi Hindus with Pahalgam terrorists, and now Nishikant Dubey has made a statement. I want to ask the CM, why does he go quiet when it comes to standing for the state?”The row comes amid a larger political campaign by MNS and Shiv Sena factions, who have joined forces to oppose what they call the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra’s schools.

Whether it’s undermining India’s armed forces or amplifying enemy models, Rahul Gandhi has a knack for ending up on the wrong side of the patriotic discourse,"" he added.Earlier on Monday, Malviya criticised Rahul Gandhi again for spreading fear and incorrect information about the stock market, highlighting that it has generated wealth for numerous retail investors through mutual funds and IPOs.Following SEBI's action against hedge fund Jane Street for alleged index manipulation, Gandhi posted on X, ""I clearly stated in 2024 -- the F&O market has become a playground for 'big players', and small investors' pockets are continuously being drained. Now, SEBI itself is admitting that Jane Street manipulated thousands of crores. Why did SEBI remain silent for so long?""BJP IT department head countered that SEBI's ban on a global entity demonstrates robust regulatory measures to protect small investors.He noted that the investigation itself disproves Gandhi's claims of SEBI's silence.Malviya emphasised that the Modi government's reforms have strengthened SEBI's transparency and independence. He pointed out that major financial scandals occurred during Congress rule, citing Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, and the UTI incident.The BJP representative highlighted India's stock market growth, noting a USD 1 trillion increase in market capitalisation since March 2025. He detailed the mutual fund industry's 576 per cent growth over a decade, with AUM rising from Rs 8 lakh crore to Rs 54 lakh crore.Referring to Gandhi as ""Balakbudhhi"", Malviya criticised him for spreading market misinformation whilst maintaining his own investment portfolio. He cited increased SIP contributions and successful IPO launches, benefiting ordinary investors.Malviya concluded by questioning Gandhi's understanding of market operations, suggesting that the Congress party's credibility was diminishing while India's markets continued to provide opportunities for millions of new investors under the Modi government's leadership.","BJP IT chief Amit Malviya claims that in 2021, Rahul Gandhi questioned why Indian forces did not use Chinese-style surveillance drones.

"Centre plans 'battery passport' to boost EV safety, quality & exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-battery-passport-to-boost-ev-safety-quality-exports/articleshow/122308453.cms,"A battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product

NEW DELHI: In a move that will help owners of electric vehicles (EVs) get precise details of the batteries being used, India will soon have its own ""Battery Passport"" regime. Under the system, the specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code. Niti Aayog has started deliberations with ministries and govt departments on the proposed framework, sources said. Officials highlighted that a battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product.The initiative will not only improve safety and quality standards but also accelerate export of EVs from India. Significantly, India is offering incentives to global EV players to set up plants and export their vehicles from India. It will also be crucial when govt rolls out a battery swapping policy for vehicles, allowing owners to access details of batteries by scanning the QR code printed on them.The need for such a regime was first felt after a series of fire incidents involving electric two-wheelers and cars. Industry insiders said there had been instances of companies importing battery cells of different vintages and using them as part of the same modules.""When cells made in different years are joined together, there is more load on new cells, as the older ones are closer to their expiry date. Such a module impacts performance and can be a safety hazard,"" said a source.Officials privy to govt's plan said once the battery passport system is implemented, it will be possible to ensure that cells in any battery are manufactured in the same year. Through it, users will get to know about the lifecycle and performance of batteries, which is key considering they account for nearly 40% of the costs of EVs, an official said.A source said, ""This move will help achieve three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality"".The European Union in 2023 enacted the Battery Regulation making it mandatory for every industrial or EV battery in EU with a capacity of over 2 kWh to have a battery passport. It will come into force on Feb 1, 2027. The battery passports will require inputs from mining and refining companies, cell and battery producers, vehicle brands, and battery servicing, refurbishing, and recycling companies.The EU rules specify that the battery passport must contain all information, including unique identifier, basic characteristics of the battery including type and model, updated statistics on performance and durability, and carbon footprint specific to the manufacturing site and batch of batteries. This information will need to be selectively shared with three groups: the general public, regulatory bodies, and battery service and end-of-life processors.","The specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code.

NEW DELHI: India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy, teacher training and financing, even as it shows consistent gains in gender parity, school completion rates and digital infrastructure. As per the 2025 Unesco SDG 4 scorecard, the country remains off-track in upper secondary and tertiary participation, lags behind global spending benchmarks, and has significant shortfalls in training qualified pre-primary teachers, though it has nearly universalised primary and lower secondary education and is improving internet connectivity in schools.India's performance on foundational learning is a key area of concern, with the report saying that countries, including India, are ""off track by 11 percentage points"" from the benchmark for achieving minimum reading proficiency by the end of primary education. India's benchmark for this indicator is 56%, but the actual achievement is substantially lower.In contrast, high-income countries reported reading proficiency levels nearing 99%, while South Asia's regional average stood at 49%. ""The large gap...is likely result of limited experience in setting realistic targets on learning outcomes, which reflects low data availability,"" it said.Gender parity is one area where India has made notable progress.The report classifies India among countries that have shown ""fast progress"" in narrowing the gender gap in upper secondary completion. India's 2025 benchmark reflects a gap of 2.3 percentage points, compared to a regional average of 3.4. ""Countries which started with a disadvantage at the expense of girls are moving towards parity,"" the report said, adding that India is aligned with this trend.Upper secondary and tertiary participation remains a serious concern. India's 2025 benchmark for upper secondary completion is 67%, but the projected out-of-school rate for youth in the 15-17 age group is still 21%. South Asia performs slightly better with a projected 13% out-of-school rate, while high-income countries have nearly achieved universal participation with rates under 2%. The report observed that ""already by 2025, it is projected that countries were off track by. ..six percentage points for upper secondary school age youth"".India's public expenditure on education was 3.1% of GDP in 2023, below the SDG benchmark of 4% and far from the National Education Policy's aspirational target of 6%. This places India below the South Asian average of 3.4% and significantly behind high-income countries, which spend between 4.8% and 5.5% of GDP. The scorecard showed, ""Countries are moving backwards in terms of public education spending, which was further away from the twin thresholds of 4% of GDP and 15% of total public expenditure in 2023 than in 2015. ""India has also not met its target for trained pre-primary teachers. The 2025 benchmark is set at 88%, but progress is slow and data limited. The report said, ""Countries are furthest behind from their 2025 national targets in training pre-primary school teachers"", with a global shortfall of seven percentage points.However, India's primary and lower secondary completion rates remain strong. The 2025 benchmarks for completion are 92% and 84%, respectively, placing India above the South Asia average of 91% for primary and 88% for lower secondary, though trailing high-income countries where completion is near-universal.While many low- and lower-middle-income countries struggle with data and implementation, India has submitted benchmarks for net connectivity in schools and is moving forward through programmes aligned with NEP. As 2030 SDG deadline approaches, the report urged countries to accelerate action.","India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy.

Data shows that there has been a more than five-fold increase in booking by drivers in June compared to the April-May period.While there were 3,348 bookings in April-May or 55 per day during the two months, this surged to 16,559 bookings or 552 per day in June. Govt expects that as the number offacilities increase, there will be a further rise in the number of bookings. The scheme was launched to address the hardship faced by drivers who often slept in trucks or at dhahas due to lack of good and affordable places along highways.Officials said over 65,000 drivers have downloaded the Apna Ghar mobile app and registered on it. To attract more users, a scheme offering free dormitory stays was introduced in June 2025 with the condition that drivers have to buy 50 litres of high-speed diesel from Apna Ghar sites. The promotional scheme will run for three months, they said.As of June, 368 Apna Ghar have been set up by oil marketing companies (OMCs) including four on the under-construction Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The entire expressway have 30 such facilities.Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri on X said, ""Most of the accidents on highways are caused by drivers not taking rest and not getting enough sleep. Air-conditioned Apna Ghars on highways has emerged as a big solution to this problem. Here, there is complete arrangement for food, cooking space, cold/hot water, bathroom, parking and bed etc. for drivers.""Drivers can book the facilities through the mobile app or directly by reaching the resting places. The govt also aims at creating trucker's wayside amenities at 1,000 large format fuel outlets on NHs by March 2027.

Shortage of surgeons & retrieval centres hinders organ transplants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shortage-of-surgeons-retrieval-centres-hinders-organ-transplants/articleshow/122308355.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: India requires to perform at least one lakh kidney transplants in a year. However, data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024, meaning that the rest of individuals in need continued to suffer with kidney dysfunction or, in some cases, succumbed due to complications. Similarly, patients suffering from end-stage failure of other organ systems face the same crisis. Recently, govt held a review meeting to assess what ails the organ transplant process in the country.A government report, accessed by TOI, is based on a recent review of organ transplantation activities in government hospitals by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). It suggests mandating govt medical colleges and associated hospitals, including trauma centres, to establish organ retrieval facilities even if they do not perform transplants themselves.Also, it has been strongly recommended that liver and heart transplants, including the lifelong costs of immunosuppressants for transplant recipients, be comprehensively included under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.The review meeting was chaired by NOTTO head Dr Anil Kumar. More than 130 medical superintendents, nodal officers for transplant centres and transplant surgeons, among others, participated.Govt hospitals, with their extensive infrastructure and high patient volumes, particularly in trauma and critical care units, are in a position to expand the national deceased organ donation programme. However, it was noted at the meeting many govt institutions that have been granted licences for organ transplants were not performing them in adequate numbers, with number of deceased donations being either nil or very low.For example, while govt institutions like IKDRC Ahmedabad (508 total organ transplants in 2024, including 195 cadaveric transplants), PGIMER Chandigarh (320 total organ transplants in 2024, including 55 cadaveric transplants) performed adequately well, institutions like GB Pant Hospital in New Delhi did not carry out any transplant despite having the physical infrastructure and licence.It is important that before considering financial support for establishing new transplant/retrieval centres, the status of existing transplant/retrieval centres and the factors which impede their performance are ascertained, the NOTTO meeting concluded.Some centres reported inadequate funds to initiate or restart specialised transplant programmes such as lung transplantation, which requires expensive equipment and preservatives. The issue of high cost of immunosuppressant drugs, which patients must take for life, was also raised at the meeting.The national organ transplant body has suggested the introduction of a system of financial incentives for key organ donation and transplant team members (surgeons, coordinators, etc.) for each successful transplant and/or organ retrieval case.","Data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024.

NEW DELHI: Hailing the armed forces for the valour they displayed during Operation Sindoor post the Pahalgam terror attack , defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that “peace time is an illusion and India must remain prepared for any uncertainty”.The defence minister praised the armed forces for Operation Sindoor but said the larger geopolitical situation leaves no scope for complacency in the effort to enhance preparedness. “A single delay or error in financial processes can directly affect operational preparedness,” said the minister while addressing the Controllers Conference of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD).Talking about rising demand for desi weapons of late, Rajnath said, “The world is looking at our defence sector with new respect. Operation Sindoor has boosted global demand for our indigenous armaments. Most of the equipment we once imported is now being made in India. Our reforms are succeeding because of the clarity of vision and commitment at the highest level. Sudden developments can force a complete shift in our financial and operational posture. ” The minister spoke in the presence of Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K.Tripathi, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh and defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh at the conference.The govt has over the past few years allowed the armed forces to procure arms and ammunition through the “emergency” route. Post-Operation Sindoor, it cleared a range of acquisitions for the armed forces.The armed forces have consistently complained, often publicly, about acquisitions being delayed because of the rigid approach of the bureaucracy and auditors. Rajnath called on DAD to evolve from a “controller” to a “facilitator” in sync with increasing participation of the private sector in defence. He praised DAD’s new motto “Alert, Agile, Adaptive” and noted that these are not mere words, but a reflection of the work culture required in today's rapidly evolving defence environment. “Whether it’s stepping up equipment production or adapting financial processes, we must be ready with innovative techniques and responsive systems at all times,” the minister said.Citing the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, which said global military expenditure reached $2.7 trillion in 2024, Rajnath said, “This opens up tremendous opportunities for India's indigenous defence industries.”The minister also said that gone were the days when expenditure in the defence sector was only considered necessary and never viewed as an economic catalyst. “Now, it is being seen as a spending which has a multiplier impact on the economy,” he said. “Earlier, there was no assessment of the economic impact of expenditure on security but things have changed now when investment in re-armament is rising exponentially. We need to pay special attention to defence economics,” he said.Singh said India, along with the rest of the world, is entering a new phase of re-armament, marked by capital-intensive investments in the defence sector. He called upon DAD to incorporate defence economics in their planning and assessments, including social impact analysis of R&D projects and dual-use technologies.Highlighting the increasing strategic and economic significance of the defence sector, Rajnath called for a shift in perception from defence spending as mere expenditure to an economic investment with multiplier impact. “Until recently, defence budgets were not seen as part of the national economy. Today, they are growth drivers,” he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that “peace time is an illusion and India must remain prepared for any uncertainty’ He was addressing the Controllers Conference of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD) “A single delay or error in financial processes can directly affect operational preparedness,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122307770,imgsize-1846138,width-400,resizemode-4/122307770.jpg"

AHMEDABAD: Around 21 years after the death of private firm employee, Sureshchandra, his wife Varsha Shukla and their son Vikrant will receive his Provident Fund (PF), following a 15-year-long legal battle.Sureshchandra's other wife, Hinarani, and daughter Vilaspati had objected to Varsha's PF claim. Last week, city civil court granted a succession certificate to Varsha and Vikrant, stating the deceased employee's PF amount of over Rs 10 lakh should be handed over to them.Sureshchandra died in May 2004 without a will. In Jan 2009, Varsha received a letter from the commissioner of EPFO, informing her that Hinarani had claimed Sureshchandra's PF amount as his widow. When Varsha objected, EPFO insisted she obtain a succession certificate. In 2010, a city civil court ordered issuance of the certificate in their names.Hirarani and Vilaspati then moved Gujarat HC in 2016, claiming they were Sureshchandra's legitimate heirs. They argued that Varsha and Vikrant had suppressed details about pending litigation in UP, and wrongfully obtained the succession certificate. In 2017, HC quashed the succession certificate and directed the city civil court to decide the issue afresh after hearing both parties.Over time, Vilaspati remained the only objector to Varsha and Vikrant's claim. In 2022, the court was told Vilaspati had died and she had no heir. The court then allowed Varsha and Vikrant's application, ordering that they be paid the PF amount along with accrued interest.","Sureshchandra died in May 2004 without a will.

KOLKATA: Candidates specified as tainted in the 2016 Bengal's School Service Commission (SSC) panel (hirings) will not be allowed to participate in a fresh school recruitment process for 35,726 vacancies, Calcutta high court held Monday and directed SSC to cancel applications by such candidates. SSC had earlier submitted a list of 'tainted candidates' before the Supreme Court.The HC bench of Justice Saugata Bhattacharyya also refused to interfere with issues of marks allotment and age relaxation in the fresh recruitment process as that would disrupt the timeline set by the apex court. The SC had directed that a fresh recruitment notification be issued by May 31 and the recruitment process completed by Dec 31.Multiple writ petitions were filed before the HC after the SSC issued the recruitment notification on May 30. While some of the petitioners claimed tainted candidates were being allowed to participate in the process others challenged extra marks for previous teaching experience and age relaxation for untainted candidates.Representing SSC, senior lawyer and TMC MP Kalyan Bandopadhyay, said the fresh recruitment process was open to all - tainted, untainted, and unsuccessful.""Can there be double punishment? Refund of salary has been directed, and service has been terminated with no age benefit. Then can they not sit for the examination? How many times will these people be penalised?"" he argued.The senior advocate said the only difference between tainted and untainted candidates in the new process was in terms of relaxation - untainted candidates were allowed an age relaxation but tainted candidates were not.Bandopadhyay argued that if tainted candidates were barred, then unsuccessful candidates should also be barred.Representing the state, advocate-general Kishore Datta argued that the ""SC judgment does not say tainted candidates will not be allowed to participate"".Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that according to an high court division bench order, upheld by the apex court, SSC was supposed to recruit afresh according to the 2016 rules. Bhattacharya specified that only two categories were allowed age relaxation, untainted candidates and disabled candidates.Justice Bhattacharyya made it clear that the court will not interfere in allotment of marks because it's a policy decision. ""What is troubling the court is whether tainted will be permitted to apply. Keeping the selection process alive in terms of the time schedule fixed by the Supreme Court, the court can debar the tainted candidates from participating.""","Bengal's School Service Commission (SSC) panel (hirings) will not be allowed to participate in fresh school recruitment process for 35,726 vacancies.

'Judicial Activism Must Not Become' Chief Justice BR Gavai's Powerful Message Against Overreach

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India B R Gavai lamented that in the recent past, the principle of ""bail is the rule, and jail is the exception"" has been forgotten. Though judicial pronouncements over the decades have integrated this norm, it has not been implemented in true spirit in recent years, he said.Delivering the Justice V R Krishna Iyer Memorial Law Lecture in Kochi on Sunday, the CJI said he tried to reestablish the principle while granting bail in various cases, paving the way for high courts and lower courts to follow suit.""I am happy to state that I had the opportunity in the last year, 2024, to reiterate this legal principle in the cases of Prabir Purkayastha, Manish Sisodia, and Kavita vs ED,"" Justice Gavai said.Justice Iyer's contribution was immense in protecting the rights of marginalised communities, he said.The SC in recent years passed a series of orders to protect the rights of undertrial prisoners and held that delay in trial and long incarceration were grounds to grant bail even in serious offences under the PMLA and the UAPA, A, despite stringent bail conditions under the special laws. It opened the gate for bail to accused in money launder- ing and unlawful activities cases.The CJI also recalled Justice Iyer’s strong opposition to undertrials being kept in jail for long periods without trial. In an important ruling in Aug last year, SC had held that the conventional idea of “bail is the rule, jail is an exception” should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also to other offences for which special statutes have been enacted, such as UAPA, if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.SC in its various orders had appealed to HCs and lower courts to be liberal in granting bail and asked them not to hesitate in granting the relief in serious offences also if a case is made out for bail.","Chief Justice of India B R Gavai lamented that in the recent past, the principle of ""bail is the rule, and jail is the exception"" has been forgotten.

Delhi HC nixes Celebi's plea against Centre's curbs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-nixes-celebis-plea-against-centres-curbs/articleshow/122305899.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: There are ""compelling national security considerations"" that led the Centre to revoke security clearances of a Turkish-owned entity for handling airport-related operations, Delhi high court said on Monday, upholding the move.It dismissed Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd's plea challenging the aviation watchdog BCAS's decision to revoke its security clearance, noting that ""once national security considerations are found to exist, it was not for the court to 'second guess' the same"".Bureau of Civil Aviation Safety (BCAS) on May 15 revoked the security clearance, days after Turkey backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. Justice Sachin Datta also pointed out that ""ground handling services at airports offer deep access to airside operations, aircraft, cargo, passenger information systems, and security zones. Such unbridled access to vital installations and infrastructure naturally elevates the need for strict security vetting for operators and their foreign affiliations. This is particularly true in the wake of contemporary challenges faced by the country in the security domain, and the escalations/incidents witnessed in the recent past, with geopolitical factors at play"".While the firm argued it was not even heard and the move was arbitrary, the HC found ""compelling national security considerations involved"" after the govt furnished material in a sealed cover for the court.""While it would not be appropriate for this court to make a verbatim reference to the relevant information/inputs, suffice it to say, that there is a necessity to eliminate the possibility of espionage and/or dual use of logistics capabilities which would be highly detrimental to the security of the country, especially in the event of an external conflict,"" the HC noted.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India Pvt Ltd oversee ground handling and cargo terminal functions at various airports in the country. HC rejected the contention of the petitioners on the denial of principles of natural justice. “No doubt, the principles of natural justice are sacrosanct; however, it is a compelling constitutional truth that security of the realm is the pre-condition for enjoyment of all other rights,” the court said in its 94-page verdict. It said the authorities are justified in taking prompt and definitive action to completely obviate the possibility of the country’s civil aviation and national security being compromised. The HC said it was also “acutely conscious” that the state must not be allowed to invoke national security as a ruse to deny procedural due process.“Any action taken by the Director General of the Bureau of Civil Aviation for the purpose of revocation of any security clearance on the basis of inputs received from the law enforcement/intelligence agency cannot be considered to be an act inconsistent with the Aircraft Rules 2023, contrary to what has been contended on behalf of the petitioners,” it said. Celebi said the Centre's move was against the principles of natural justice and in violation of the procedure under the Aircraft Security Rules. Celebi, operating in the Indian aviation sector for over 15 years and employing over 10,000 people, offers its services at nine airports.","Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd challenged the aviation watchdog's decision to revoke its security clearance.

Drug regulator issues list of 17 drugs which should be flushed down if unused or expired,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drug-regulator-issues-list-of-17-drugs-which-should-be-flushed-down-if-unused-or-expired/articleshow/122305871.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India's top drug regulatory body, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), has released a list of 17 drugs which, it says, should be flushed down the sink if lying unused or expired at home.This includes fentanyl, Tramadol and several other painkiller drugs and Diazepam which is an anti-anxiety medication.According to the CDSCO, these drugs may be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose if they are used by someone other than the person for whom the medicine was prescribed. If these drugs are kept unwanted, unused or expired, the drug regulatory body says, they should be flushed down the sink or toilet to prevent danger to people and pets in the home. However, for most other medications used commonly by people, the drug regulatory body in its latest guidelines on disposal of unused/expired drugs recommends that scientific disposal is needed to prevent environmental pollution.For that, it suggests the initiation of 'drug take back' initiative that could be led by either the state drug control department or local chemists initially but eventually, the CDSCO recommends, the state govt in coordination with local bodies needs to establish the methodology and facility for the collection of and disposal of unused or expired drugs as per the provision of Biomedical Waste Management Rules.""Initially, state drugs control departments and concerned chemists and druggists' associations may jointly launch 'drug take back' site programme at designated locations, where people can drop expired or unused drugs from their homes and that can be disposed finally by such associations under intimation to concerned state drug licencing authority with the help of registered/licenced external agencies.The CDSCO guideline follows multiple reports and studies that show how unscientific disposal of unused or unexpired drugs is causing environmental pollution, eventually affecting human life.A study by led by Dr T Velpandian of AIIMS' ocular pharmacology division that analysed water samples from seven places in Yamuna river, including the entry and exit points, 35 bore wells in Delhi NCR and the water percolating from waste at Ghazipur landfill site in 2018 showed drugs thrown in the waste bins end up in the environment and contribute to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens.The study showed presence of antibiotics and other drugs in the surface water of river Yamuna and in areas adjacent to the Ghazipur landfill. “The govt move to formulate a guideline on disposal of unused or expired drugs is commendable indeed. We also plan to develop a pamphlet on how to dispose of drugs that will be given to all patients while being discharged from the hospital to create more awareness on the subject,” Devarati Majumdar, director and chief of pharmacy at Max healthcare said. She added that the drugs mentioned by the CDSCO in the ‘flush list’ contain mostly the narcotic drugs that are addictive and vulnerable for misuse and that’s why the govt may have suggested they be flushed down.","India's top drug regulatory body has released a list of 17 drugs which, it says, should be flushed down the sink if lying unused or expired at home.

"Bar council not an employer, no need for POSH panel: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bar-council-not-an-employer-no-need-for-posh-panel-hc/articleshow/122305852.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Bombay high court said on Monday that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 will not apply to complaints by advocates to bar councils as there is no employer-employee relationship between them. Hearing a petition seeking direction to bar councils to set up committees to address sexual harassment complaints against advocates, a bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne said POSH Act will apply to cases where there is an employer-employee relationship, and bar councils cannot be said to be ""employer of advocates"".The petition also sought the implementation of the POSH Act and a committee of lawyers, NGOs, and retired women judges to review and look into lacunas in the Act. The bench were hearing a petition by UNS Women Association seeking direction to the Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa to constitute a permanent grievance redressal committee of female advocates in all state bar council offices and bar associations to address sexual harassment complaints against advocates as per Supreme Court's Oct 2012 directions in Medha Kotwal Lele's case. The petition also sought the implementation of POSH Act and a committee of lawyers, NGOs, and retired female judges to review and look into lacunas in the Act.Senior advocate Milind Sathe, for BCMG, and advocate Shekhar Jagtap, for BCI, submitted that there is no employer-employee relationship between advocates and bar councils. Hence, the establishment of an internal complaints committee is not applicable as per POSH Act. They said there is a provision for local committees headed by the district collector to receive complaints of sexual harassment for a workplace having fewer than 10 employees. However, neither ICC nor the local committees can be invoked by female advocates. Sathe said under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961, there is remedy for professional and other misconduct.The judges referred to sections of the POSH Act relating to the constitution of ICC and local committees and also considered the definition of employer. In the order, they said it is evident that these provisions will apply to a case where there is a relationship of employer and employee. Therefore, neither BCI nor BCMG “can be said to be employer of advocates” and “therefore the 2013 Act will not apply to advocates”, they added. However, POSH Act will be applicable to employees of BCI and BCMG.Sathe and Jagtap said BCMG and BCI have constituted ICCs to address grievances of their employees. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan said local committees have also been established. The judges noted that as far as the grievance of female advocates is concerned, there is a forum available under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, which provides for lodging complaints tantamount to professional and other misconduct."," Bombay high court said Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 will not apply to complaints by advocates to bar councils.

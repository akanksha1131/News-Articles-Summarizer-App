"Handling automatic rifles, self-defence: Army trains Village Defence Guards in J&K - watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/handling-automatic-rifles-self-defence-army-trains-village-defence-guards-in-jk-watch/articleshow/126264068.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army has launched a training programme for the Villager Defence Guards (VDG) in Jammu and Kashmir amid the ongoing counter-terrorism operation in the higher reaches of Chenab valley.According to the Army, around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, they said.Officials told news agency PTI that the raining is being conducted at Shingini panchayat of Balassa, around 90 km from the Doda district headquarters. It aims to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as a first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas.The move complements the ongoing operation by the Army, police and paramilitary forces in the higher reaches to track down and neutralise the terrorists who had managed to infiltrate into Chenab valley, especially Doda and Kishtwar districts, a couple of years back, officials added.The VDGs welcomed the training and the recent upgradation of their weaponry. They expressed gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for providing self-loading rifles (SLRs), replacing the older .303 rifles, which they said, has significantly boosted their confidence.""This is a major programme bringing together members from 17 Village Defence Groups. We are being trained in weapon handling, bunker construction and self-defence. Receiving such training at our doorstep is highly appreciable,"" Surinder Singh, a VDG member from Shingani, said.He requested the government to provide more automatic weapons to the members, recalling the frequent terror attacks in the region during the early 1990s.Another VDG member, Rajesh Kumar Thakur from Gauala village, said the training by the Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police has instilled a sense of confidence.""Earlier, we only had .303 rifles. After receiving automatic weapons, our confidence has increased, and we now feel capable of defending our villages,"" he said.This comes as he Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.Meanwhile, the Army and security forces have also adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.","Around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shama Mohamed has raised concerns over the law and order situation following the death of Angel Chakma, a student from Tripura in Dehradun.Referring to a video circulating online, she alleged rising threats against minorities and questioned the Prime Minister's silence, urging the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter.Speaking to ANI, Mohamed said, ""Such an incident can happen with anyone. I have seen a video today, in which a group of Hindu men said they would kill all Muslims in the country. They are warning the Muslims and why is our Prime Minister silent? The Supreme Court should take suo motto cognisance... There is a complete breakdown of law and order...""Meanwhile, People in Agartala organised a candle march to seek justice for Anjel Chakma, a resident of Nandanagar in Tripura, who was attacked in Uttarakhand's Dehradun in December and later died in hospital during treatment.A large number of people participated in the march, urging the authorities to take strict action against those responsible for the incident. Protesters demanded the harshest punishment for the accused.Speaking to ANI, Samir Chakma, chairman of the Chakma Committee, said that thousands had gathered to demand justice for Anjel Chakma. He stated that the march was organised to condemn the brutal killing and to press for stringent punishment for the perpetrators.""Today we have gathered here in a crowd of nearly thousands, and everyone who has come is here to demand justice for Anjel Chakma. Today we are holding a candle march here. First of all, we demand that those responsible for the brutal killing of Anjel Chakma must face the strictest possible action and be punished. We will demand that punishment--meaning the death penalty--be given to those people,"" Samir Chakma, chairman of the Chakma committee, told ANI.Chakma, an MBA student, was attacked by a group of miscreants with knives and other blunt objects in Dehradun on December 9 and later died while undergoing treatment at a hospital.The brutal killing of Anjel Chakma, a student from Tripura, in Dehradun has sparked widespread outrage across the political fraternity, with leaders condemning the incident and demanding swift justice.Five of the accused have already been arrested, including two minors sent to a juvenile reform home, while the sixth accused, a Nepalese national, remains at large with a reward of Rs 25,000 announced for his capture.The Uttarakhand government has assured that all possible measures are being taken to ensure the perpetrators face the harshest possible punishment and to ensure the safety of northeast students across the country.SSP Singh mentioned that a preliminary investigation was conducted, during which additional sections were added to the case, including sections related to attempted murder.""Along with that, a supplementary report was taken, in which the sections were increased. Sections of the attempt to murder (109) were added, on the basis of statements. In the meantime, a separate team was formed, and five people were arrested. The sixth accused was of Nepali origin. He left the place the next day after the incident. For this, a dedicated team has been set up. According to the information so far, the accused may be hiding in nearby bordering areas,"" he said.","Congress leader Shama Mohamed has raised concerns over the law and order situation following the death of Angel Chakma.

"'To build peace that lasts': Now, China claims credit for mediating India-Pakistan conflict; takes leaf out of Trump's book",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-build-peace-that-lasts-now-china-claims-credit-for-mediating-india-pakistan-conflict-takes-leaf-out-of-trumps-book/articleshow/126262494.cms,"""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has claimed that Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking at the Symposium on the International Situation and China’s Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Wang said Beijing had taken an “objective and just stance” to build peace and focused on addressing “both symptoms and root causes”.“This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII. Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread,” Wang said at the symposium in Beijing.“To build peace that lasts, we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes. Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.The statement comes despite Beijing’s role during the May 7–10 Operation Sindoor conflict between India and Pakistan coming under serious scrutiny and criticism, particularly over alleged military assistance provided by China to Islamabad.After the conflict flared up, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt General Rahul R Singh had said Beijing used the confrontation as a “live lab”, while declining to directly elaborate on the charge.Gen Singh said China’s strategy during Operation Sindoor was based on its ancient military doctrine of the “36 stratagems”, accusing Beijing of seeking to hurt India by “killing with a borrowed knife” — a reference to alleged Chinese support to Pakistan.Meanwhile, the Indian Army on Tuesday hailed Operation Sindoor, underlining ten major milestones achieved by the force in 2025.“Nine terrorist camps across the border were destroyed. The Indian Army neutralised seven camps, while the remaining two were destroyed by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan attempted to target military and civilian assets using drones, but Indian Army air defence units successfully neutralised all threats, preventing damage and casualties. More than a dozen terror launch pads along the Line of Control were destroyed using Indian Army ground-based weapons,” the Army said.“The director general of military operations of the Indian Army was approached by his Pakistani counterpart with a request for a ceasefire. An understanding was reached to stop firing and military action,” it added.India and Pakistan were locked in a brief but intense military confrontation in May, triggered by a terror attack in the Pahalgam valley of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives.India responded with Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.India has consistently dismissed claims of any third-party mediation, maintaining that the four-day confrontation was resolved through direct military-to-military communication.New Delhi has maintained that after sustaining heavy damage, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart, and both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect from May 10.","Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claims Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May.

bail clause not right to favourable outcome: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, failing which the bail would be deemed legally unsustainable.Interpreting Section 15A(5) of the SC/ST (POA) Act, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard while considering a bail application and bail can be cancelled on the ground of violation of this section.The bench clarified that the provision guarantees an opportunity to be heard, not a right to a favourable outcome or to a detailed adjudication of every objection raised by the victim. ""Once the victim has been notified, permitted to participate, and allowed to place objections on record, the statutory mandate stands satisfied,"" it said.""It is beyond cavil that section 15A(5) incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) for victims under the SC/ST (POA) Act. Where such a right is conferred, the court must provide the victim or their dependent an opportunity of audience, either personally or through counsel, including the special public prosecutor.The statutory right to be heard presupposes that the victim is made aware of the proceedings and is not excluded therefrom,"" the bench said.Referring to earlier verdicts of SC, the bench said, ""The court approved the view taken by Gujarat HC in Hemal Ashwin Jain case which categorically held that failure to provide the victim an opportunity of being heard in bail proceedings constitutes a failure of justice, rendering the order legally unsustainable. This court concluded that the victim or dependent is an active stakeholder in proceedings under the SC/ ST (POA) Act and that compliance with Sections 15A(3) and 15A(5) is mandatory"".The court passed the order on a plea seeking cancellation of bail of an accused. Though the bench said that there was no violation of Section 15A(5) as the victim was given hearing, it, however, quashed the bail order of Madras HC on the ground that the criminal antecedent of the accused was not considered by HC.The top court said the high court order suffers from fatal infirmities as it ignored that the bail for the accused in another case was cancelled after the death of a material witness when he was out on bail. The criminal antecedents of the accused were expressly placed before HC and were recorded in the impugned judgment but HC failed to draw any conclusion from them, it said.",Supreme Court said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126261732,imgsize-1478930,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

DEHRADUN: The family of Anjel Chakma, the young Tripura native killed in Dehradun earlier this month, pushed back sharply against the city police chief's public dismissal of racial slurs as a motive behind the murder - a claim central to the family's version of events and backed, they say, by the firsthand account of Anjel's brother, Michael, who witnessed the attack.Momen Chakma, Anjel's uncle and among the first relatives to arrive in the city after the assault, said the police were choosing to ignore the words of the only eyewitness. ""Michael is not just a family member, he's the complainant in the case. He was there when it happened. The incident lasted minutes - how do you expect anyone to stop and film something like that?"" he told TOI Tuesday. ""Instead of listening to the person who saw it unfold, they are issuing public statements without even completing the investigation. ""Faced with mounting questions, Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh clarified Tuesday that Michael's complaint only mentioned ""casteist slurs"". He said, ""The family stayed in Dehradun until Dec 27 but did not mention racial slurs to the police...If they want to share additional information, we are open to including it in the probe.""If the family of Tripura native Anjel Chakma is saying this (racial slurs motive behind the murder) now, we are not aware of it.However, the case is still under investigation,"" Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said. Police were gathering all possible evidence to build a strong case before filing the chargesheet, he added. Dehradun police, citing ethnic background of some of the accused, had said they found no indication of racial provocation in the case. The family, still grieving, called this ""premature and deeply dismissive"".Anjel, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour. According to Michael and other family members, the attackers shouted racial slurs - words like ""chinki"", ""Chinese"", and ""momo"" - before turning violent. Michael sustained injuries, and Anjel later died of his wounds. ""It's not just about one word or one insult,"" Momen said. ""It's about whether our voices are even considered valid when we speak.""SSP Singh had on Monday pointed out that two of the six accused were from Manipur and Nepal, which, he said, made a racial motive unlikely. That reasoning has since triggered public criticism, particularly from members of North-East civil society and activists familiar with the region's complex ethnic and linguistic diversity.","Anjel Chakma, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour.

Chicken’s Neck Threat Sparks Sharp Reply As Nagaland Minister Warns Bangladesh Radicals Boldly

GUWAHATI: Assam police busted a module of Imam Mahmuder Kafila (IMK) with the arrest of 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018. Investigators said IMK expanded its base in the state after Bangladesh's Aug 2024 regime change that led to the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Of the 11 people held by Assam police's Special Task Force (STF), 10 were picked up from Assam and one from Tripura in operations since late Monday night. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma acknowledged the threat from such modules. ""Fundamentalists are definitely active in Assam. The issue will remain for long as Bangladesh is Assam's neighbouring country,"" Sarma said.STF chief and Guwahati police commissioner Partha Sarathi Mahanta said IMK used encrypted social media groups to radicalise and recruit youths in Assam and nearby states, spread propaganda, raise funds through hawala and UPI channels, and facilitate cross-border travel for training.""Probe revealed that following the regime change in Bangladesh in Aug 2024, top leaders of JMB, Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued directions to IMK leadership to activate and expand its Indian modules.Bangladeshi nationals Umar and Khalid were assigned to coordinate Assam-based activities. The head of the Assam cell is one Nasim Uddin alias Tamim of Barpeta Road in Barpeta district in Assam,"" Mahanta said.Nasim Uddin was among those 11 arrested. Multiple charges under BNS, 2023 and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 were slapped on the suspects.Mahanta said IMK, banned in India, was formed by Jewel Mahmud alias Imam Mahmud Habibullah alias Sohail, described as a former JMB member who claims to be the amir (leader) of IMK and propagates the ideology of ""Ghazwatul Hind (Battle against India)"".Mahanta said IMK propagated an ideology aligned with proscribed transnational jihadi organisations and operated through secure social media platforms. ""One such social media group is 'Purva Akash', which functions as a principal communication and recruitment platform. People from Assam, Bengal and Tripura were being radicalised, recruited, financially mobilised. IMK disseminates extremist propaganda advocating violent jihad and the armed conquest of India. ""Investigators found that some Assam-based IMK operatives had travelled to Bangladesh earlier this year on valid passports and visas for training and coordination, Mahanta further said.",Assam police arrest 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018.

‘Worst Is Behind Us’: IndiGo CEO Says Airline Back on Track After Operational Crisis

NEW DELHI: Flight travel across India remained disrupted for another day on Monday with several flights cancelled and many cancellations set for Tuesday as well.As per the IndiGo's cancelled flight data, 59 flights, scheduled for December 30 have now been cancelled. 116 flights were cancelled on Monday, majorly due to bad weather while 5 were due to operational reasons.Earlier in the day, ministry of civil aviation had also issued an advisory warning of possible delays. ""Due to fog conditions across parts of Northern India, flight operations at select airports may be impacted, leading to possible delays. Passengers are advised to stay updated through official airline communication channels, allow additional time for airport arrival and check-in procedures, and plan their travel accordingly,"" it had said.Air India also issued its advisory during the day saying, ""Weather forecast continues to indicate dense fog for tomorrow morning with significantly reduced visibility at Delhi and parts of northern India. This will affect flight schedules to and from Delhi with cascading effects likely across our network. We are closely monitoring the situation and have taken proactive steps to minimise disruptions . In the event of unexpected delays, diversions or cancellations resulting from fog, please rest assured that our ground teams are available at key touchpoints in the airports to extend assistance to you.We understand how frustrating such disruption to travel plans can be and are making every possible effort to minimise the inconvenience,"" it said, while explaining its ""FogCare initiate"" to help the passengers.Under DGCA fog operations (CAT-IIIB) norms, airlines are required to mandatorily roster pilots trained for low-visibility operations and deploy aircraft that are compliant with CAT-IIIB standards.Category-III refers to an advanced instrument landing system that enables aircraft to operate in foggy conditions. Category-III-A is a precision approach and landing system that allows operations with a runway visual range (RVR) of up to 200 metres, while Category-III-B permits landings when the RVR drops below 50 metres.","116 flights were cancelled on Monday, majorly due to bad weather while 5 were due to operational reasons. 59 flights, scheduled for December 30 have now been cancelled.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

.

Leaders worldwide offers condolences after the death of former PM





Former Bangladesh prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia died early Tuesday at the age of 80, party officials confirmed. She had been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. According to her party, Zia died around 6.00 am, shortly after Fajr prayers, after remaining in critical condition for months.A dominant figure in Bangladesh’s politics for decades, Khaleda Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister and the long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia. Zia had been under intensive medical care since November.Her death comes just days after her elder son and BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman returned to Bangladesh from London, ending 17 years of self-imposed exile as the country moves toward crucial national elections.Khaleda Zia was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri and grew up in Dinajpur. She married Ziaur Rahman in 1960, who later became Bangladesh’s president after seizing power as a military chief in 1977.Following his assassination in a military coup in 1981, Khaleda, who had never been involved in politics, entered public life and took charge of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1984.She emerged as a key leader in the mass movement against military ruler HM Ershad, earning a reputation as an uncompromising figure in the struggle to restore democracy. In 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, introducing the parliamentary system of government and later playing a role in establishing the caretaker government system for elections.Khaleda Zia served as prime minister two times from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. Her political career was defined by a fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, a contestant who shaped Bangladesh’s politics for more than three decades.In later years, Zia faced multiple corruption cases, which her party described as politically motivated. She was jailed in 2018 and remained largely confined due to illness after being granted temporary release in 2020. In January 2025, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case against her, effectively clearing her name.Following Hasina’s ouster in a mass uprising in 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus allowed Zia to travel abroad for advanced treatment. She returned from London in May but remained seriously ill and withdrew from active politics, though she continued as BNP chairperson until her death.Khaleda Zia is survived by her elder son Tarique Rahman, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko died in 2015. Despite years of illness and imprisonment, she remains one of the most influential and polarising figures in Bangladesh’s political history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his 'sincere condolences' after the death of Khaleda Zia and recalled his meeting with former PM in Dhaka in 2015.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Deeply saddened to learn about the passing away of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka. Our sincerest condolences to her family and all the people of Bangladesh. May the Almighty grant her family the fortitude to bear this tragic loss. """"As the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, her important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered. I recall my warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015. We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership. May her soul rest in peace,"" PM Modi further wrote.Muhammad Yunus also expressed his profound grief over the death of former BNP chief and described her as a ""great guardian"" of the nation and a towering figure in Bangladesh's democratic history.""Begum Khaleda Zia was not merely the leader of a political party; she represented an important chapter in the history of Bangladesh,"" Yunus wrote in his message. The BNP has declared seven days of official mourning following her death.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80. Zia was the country's first woman prime minister and long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126242736,imgsize-347459,width-400,resizemode-4/khaleda-zia.jpg"

Message to Congress leadership or attacking coterie? Why Digvijaya Singh’s 'power of organisation' post is intriguing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-congress-leadership-or-attacking-coterie-why-digvijaya-singhs-power-of-organisation-post-is-intriguing/articleshow/126253556.cms,"Shashi Tharoor Responds To Digvijaya Singh, Says Congress Needs Discipline, Not Lessons From RSS

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is no stranger to controversies. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who is known to speak out his mind, has triggered several political storms with his remarks. The veteran Congress leader, who has been one of the strongest critics of the BJP and the RSS , has often been accused of insulting the Hindu community to appease the minorities. In fact, such has been some of his remarks in the past that even the Congress was forced to distance itself from them. It is in this context that his latest social media post citing RSS and BJP to highlight the “power of organisation” seems intriguing.The Congress Rajya Sabha member on Saturday shared a 1996 photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with L K Advani and praised the BJP and the RSS for promoting ground workers – alluding to PM Modi – to posts like chief minister and Prime Minister. ""I found this picture on the Quora site. It is very impactful. In the way the grassroots swayamsevaks (workers) of RSS and the workers of Jan Sangh @BJP4India sit on the floor at the feet of leaders and become the Chief Minister of the state and the Prime Minister of the country. This is the power of the organization. Jai Siya Ram,"" Singh said on X.As expected, the post created a flutter. The fact that it coincided with the Congress Working Committee meeting and was tagged not just to the party's top leadership but also to Prime Minister Modi added to the intrigue.Also, the use of ""Jai Siya Ram"" at the end seemed strange for a leader, who was once in the centre of a storm for using “Osamaji” for Osama bin Laden. Under all round fire then, Digvijaya had clarified that it was a slip of tongue.So, what was the objective of Digvijaya’s post? Was he actually trying to please the BJP and the RSS? Or was he dropping hints about his future plans and sending a message to the top leadership? Or was he targeting leaders within the Congress who are close to the top leadership?While nothing is impossible in politics, it is difficult to believe that Digvijaya would have had a sudden change of heart vis-a-vis the RSS and BJP and would try to please them.So, was the Congress veteran sending across a message to the top leadership? Well, Digvijaya’s Rajya Sabha term ends in July 2026 and the big question is will the Congress nominate him again? If not, how would he react? After all, we have seen another party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad turn from a loyalist to a rebel and quit the party in 2021 after he was denied a Rajya Sabha ticket. Will Digvijaya follow suit if ignored? Well, we do not know for now.So, that brings us to the third possible reason for Digvijaya’s post. Was the senior Congress leader targeting the top office-bearers in his party responsible for running the organisation and who are very close to the leadership? The fact that many leaders came out in his support on the need to strengthen the organization gives some credence to this possibility.Most Congress leaders, as expected, unleashed a broadside against Digvijaya’s post and rejected the idea of learning anything from the RSS. Congress leader Pawan Khera said, ""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?""Congress MP Manickam Tagore asserted that the Congress had nothing to learn from what he described as a hate-driven organisation. “The RSS is an organisation of hatred. It spreads hatred, breeds hatred and carries out propaganda based on hate. There is nothing to learn from the RSS,” he said.However, many others defended Digvijaya and argued that the focus should not be on the example he had cited but on his message for strength and unity in an organization. They cited his commitment to the Congress and also his strong anti-RSS stand in the past.""Look, it is important to pay attention to whose words are being used, what they mean, and in what context they are spoken. No one can even remotely think that whatever Digvijaya Singh says would not be in the interest of the Congress party or that he would speak in a way that goes against the party's ideology. He is a pillar of the Congress party, and if he has used any particular language, it is necessary to understand what his context was and what his target was what he was trying to do,"" Salman Khurshid told ANI.Congress leader TS Singh Deo defended Digvijaya Singh's remarks and said: ""Digvijaya Singh is much senior to me; I cannot comment on his statement. He will be able to explain it better, but as far as strengthening the organisation is concerned, it is a continuous process...In any organisation, whether it is the BJP, RSS, or any other, everyone's work is reviewed. The BJP certainly reviews the Congress and other parties. .. So, Digvijaya Singh's intention was not to imitate anyone, but he spoke about what we can do to strengthen the organisation.""Congress MP Imran Masood said Digvijaya Singh has consistently opposed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Digvijay Singh is a staunch opponent of the RSS. That's all I know; there's no need to create so much controversy over this,"" he said. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla also defended the former MP CM and said that the matter was being ""unnecessarily amplified"".Party leader Udit Raj openly backed Digvijaya’s message and admitted that the grand old party was grappling with serious organisational weaknesses and widespread factionalism. ""There is definitely organisational weakness. Is there any doubt about that? For 10 years, we couldn't even appoint district presidents. Whenever someone was appointed, another group would block it. Factionalism is rampant,"" Udit Raj told news agency IANS. ""Discussion is part of Congress tradition; we don't run a dictatorship like the BJP. It is in our tradition to introspect. If there were no organisational weaknesses, would we keep losing elections repeatedly? The positive thing is that we are working to overcome our shortcomings. There is nothing wrong with it,"" he added.Candid confession that to some extent justifies Digvijaya’s strong post.However, with his remarks putting the Congress on the backfoot, Digvijaya first issued clarification and then sent out a unity message slamming the BJP. ""I am a supporter of the organisation, but an opponent of the RSS and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. I have only praised the organisational strength of the RSS. I have always opposed the policies of the BJP and the RSS,"" he said as his post raised a storm. Later, he targeted the BJP and said ""There is no difference in ideology. We (Congress) are all united, and this Nehru-Gandhi family is a family in which two people have been martyred. I strongly condemn the BJP's attempts to sow discord within this family."" "" Rahul Gandhi has started this initiative (strengthening the organisation) from the district level and below. The process for that is underway. It will be completed soon,"" the Rajya Sabha member added.While this clarification helps the Congress counter the BJP attacks, it does little to solve the mystery behind his cryptic message: Was Digvijaya dropping hints about his future plans or was he targeting Congress leadership and the coterie in the party?",Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is no stranger to controversies. His latest social media post citing RSS and BJP to highlight the “power of organisation” seems intriguing. Was he actually trying to please the BJP and the RSS? Or was he dropping hints about his future plans?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126255265,imgsize-771097,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The contract highlights the synergy between the govt and private sector, which will further give impetus to the Make-in-India initiative,” it added.The Rs 1,896 crore contract for the procurement and integration of 48 “Black Shark” heavyweight torpedoes, along with associated equipment, for the Navy’s six Kalvari-class or Scorpene submarines, in turn, was signed with WASS Submarine Systems S.R.L.,Italy.The diesel-electric Scorpene submarines have been constructed by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore. The first submarine INS Kalvari was commissioned into the Navy in Dec 2017, while the sixth INS Vagsheer in Jan this year.“The delivery of the 48 torpedoes will begin from April 2028 and be completed by early-2030.The torpedoes, which have significant operational capabilities and advanced technological features, will enhance the combat capability of the six Kalvari-class submarines,” the MoD said.","The Rs 2,770 crore deal for the CQB carbines, along with accessories, was inked with Bharat Forge Ltd and PLR Systems (a joint venture between Adani Defence and Israel Weapon Industries) The delivery of the 48 torpedoes will begin from April 2028 and be completed by early-2030.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126252551,imgsize-754124,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

SRINAGAR: For decades, scholars had tried to translate the Constitution of India into Kashmiri. That wait has now ended. The translation is now available on the Union law ministry’s website.President Droupadi Murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with Chinar leaves and traditional Kashmiri decorative art. Prof. Aejaz Mohammad Sheikh of University of Kashmir, who led a 11-member translation panel that worked on the project for over two years, described the work as a “watershed moment” for Kashmiri language.“You now have the Bible of law in Kashmiri. This is not just a transfer of knowledge. It enriches the language itself. It gives Kashmiri the legal and intellectual vocabulary needed to translate science, law and modern knowledge,” Sheikh said.Many experts believe that while Kashmiri language possesses a rich body of translated works, including classics from world literature, the translation of a foundational legal document like the Constitution marks a historic first.“A common Kashmiri can now read the Constitution in their own language.When students see that Kashmiri language can carry the language of law, not just poetry, it changes how they see their mother tongue. It proves that Kashmiri language has the grammar, lexicon and strength to express the most complex ideas. This translation has the ability to move Kashmiri language out of a confined literary circle, allowing it to reach the common masses,” said Sheikh, who is dean of School of Arts, Languages and Literature at the university.A govt official echoed the view. “By incorporating constitutional, legal and administrative terminology, the translation strengthens Kashmiri’s capacity to function as a language of governance and law.” Linguistic experts believe the text should be introduced in schools and made available through voice-based software so it can reach the wider public.Basher Bashir, another member of the translation panel, said the exactness and authenticity had been maintained in the legal text of the Constitution.The project began in Aug 2023 when National Translation Mission (NTM) of Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysuru, approached Sheikh. Fluent in Kashmiri, Urdu and Hindi, and proficient in Sanskrit, the professor agreed to do it. He put together a multidisciplinary team of linguists, academics and legal experts from his university, Satish Vimal of All India Radio (Srinagar), and education department officials.Team members first worked individually, then met to compare and refine their drafts. This was followed by a series of intensive seven-day workshops. The first was held in Mysuru, where legal experts read the Constitution in English while linguists compared it with their Kashmiri translation.. Every term was debated, every phrase tested. Where differences arose, they were discussed until a consensus was reached before moving forward.After the fifth workshop, Sheikh carried out a final, detailed review and submitted the draft. The manuscript was placed online for public feedback for three months by the Union law ministry before the President formally released the final version on Nov 27. The translation uses the standard Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script, adopting a simpler, more accessible style.On Sept 2, 2020, the Union Cabinet had approved Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020, recognising five official languages in the UT -- Urdu, Hindi, Kashmiri, Dogri and English. Before the revocation of Article 370, Urdu was the sole official language of the erstwhile J&K state.","President Droupadi Murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with Chinar leaves and traditional Kashmiri decorative art.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: Security forces Tuesday launched cordon-and-search operations in the upper reaches of Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch districts in J&K after reported sightings of terror suspects. Official sources said two groups of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, each consisting of two to three ultras, were believed to be moving in the region, which has witnessed encounters in the past.“Acting on inputs about the presence of suspected terrorists in Doda-Kishtwar forests, security forces launched an anti-terror operation in Keshwan-Chatroo valley. Drones were roped in for aerial surveillance,” an official source said.Official sources said Army personnel carried out search operations at Khanetar Top along the Line of Control in Poonch and adjoining areas on Tuesday after suspicious movements were reported. The troops were equipped with aerial surveillance support and sniffer dogs.On Nov 5, a fierce gun battle broke out between troops and terrorists in Kalaban forests, Chatroo (Kishtwar). The district has seen as many as six encounters in the past seven months, even as troops continued their hunt for Pakistan-based ultras hiding in Chatroo and adjoining hilly areas. On Dec 15, an SOG jawan was killed in a gunfight in Udhampur district’s Sohan village.","Security forces launch cordon-and-search operations in upper reaches of Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch districts.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: A court in north Kashmir’s Kupwara granted Tuesday bail to eight policemen, including a DSP, accused of illegally holding and torturing a fellow J&K constable for six days in Feb 2023. The order came after CBI dropped attempt-to-murder charge against the accused.The case stems from a CBI FIR registered on July 26 this year on directions of the Supreme Court, which took cognizance of allegations that constable Khursheed Ahmed Chowhan was unlawfully held at the joint interrogation centre in Kupwara from Feb 20 to Feb 26 and subjected to severe abuse “on the pretext of investigating narcotics-related offences”.Chowhan’s wife Rubeena Akhter had moved the top court after J&K high court declined to order registration of a case. Her petition alleged her husband was beaten with iron rods and wooden sticks, given electric shocks and left critically wounded, with claims of mutilation, grievous harm to private parts, insertion of iron rods and chili powder allegedly forced into his rectum.Acting on the Supreme Court’s July 21 order, CBI filed a chargesheet on Oct 22 this year.On Tuesday, the principal district and sessions judge of Kupwara directed the superintendent of Humhama subsidiary jail in Srinagar to release the accused after they furnish bail and surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each.Advocate Ahrar Dar, appearing for the accused, said the home department had not granted mandatory sanction to prosecute at the time of filing the chargesheet. He said a “crucial and material change of circumstance” occurred after investigators dropped the most serious counts — IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (grievous hurt by dangerous weapons).“The legal impediment of section 307, which was the cornerstone of the previous bail rejection, no longer exists,” Dar said, adding that the case now rests on less severe charges within the court’s bail jurisdiction. He said CBI opposed bail but the court granted relief after hearing arguments.","A court in north Kashmir’s Kupwara granted Tuesday bail to eight policemen, including a DSP.

Proof needed, not promises

NEW DELHI: When questions are raised about the safety of any food article, India's food regulator will now ask for proof, not promises. From what a product contains and how much Indians actually eat to whether it's safe over time, every claim will have to be backed by data to assess its safety.From Jan 1, 2026, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has made it mandatory for all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards to follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence. The move comes after the regulator found that many past requests lacked basic data or a uniform structure, making proper risk assessment difficult.The new rule does not trigger an automatic re-examination of all foods already in the market. It applies only when a stakeholder approaches FSSAI seeking a scientific risk assessment - either for introducing a new product or reviewing an existing one. In such cases, the burden of proving safety will rest with the applicant.Under the new format, submissions must spell out nutritional information, how much Indians consume the product, results of toxicological studies, and evidence on safe intake limits, along with allergy risks and supporting scientific studies.The data will be reviewed by FSSAI's Science and Standards Division and assessed by expert panels, which will decide whether a product can be cleared, continued, restricted or subjected to tighter limits.Officials say the sharper focus on Indian eating habits is crucial as packaged foods become more common and overseas data may not reflect real exposure.""This is an important step to protect public health. Earlier, many foods were approved using limited or incomplete information. Since Indian food habits, portion sizes and sensitivities are very different from those in other countries, asking for proper proof about long-term safety, how much people eat and possible allergy risks helps make food rules more practical, science-based and safer for Indian consumers,"" said Anjali Bhola, dietician at National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.FSSAI has also assured stakeholders that data submitted for risk assessment will be treated as confidential and used only for scientific evaluation and policy decisions. For consumers, the message is simple: when food safety is questioned, evidence will now decide what stays on the plate.","From Jan 1, 2026, all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards must follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence.

January 22: Jalgaon train tragedy

The train made an unscheduled halt around 5 pm after someone pulled the emergency chain, prompting frightened passengers to jump onto the tracks.

Unaware of an oncoming train on the adjacent line, several were struck by the Karnataka Express approaching from the opposite direction.

The incident occurred between Maheji and Pardhade stations near Pachora, more than 400 km from Mumbai, turning panic and confusion into a deadly accident.

January 29: Maha Kumbh stampede

The month-long Prayagraj Maha Kumbh Mela saw tens of millions of pilgrims arrive, with authorities estimating that nearly 10 crore devotees turned up on Mauni Amavasya alone.

saw tens of millions of pilgrims arrive, with authorities estimating that nearly 10 crore devotees turned up on Mauni Amavasya alone. In the early hours of January 29, at around 1 am, a crush broke out near the Sangam nose area, close to a main bathing ghat. As devotees moved through narrow and crowded paths ahead of the Amrit Snan, panic spread, and a stampede followed.

Ambulances rushed the injured to the central hospital inside the Mela grounds, where nearly 30 people died, and several others were injured.

February 15: New Delhi railway station stampede

On the night of February 15, a massive rush of passengers waited to board trains to Prayagraj, where the Maha Kumbh was underway.

As several trains were delayed, the already overcrowded platforms 14 and 15 turned chaotic within a few minutes, as people rushed forward, resulting in multiple casualties.

The government later told the Lok Sabha that 49,000 general or unreserved tickets were sold at the New Delhi Railway Station counter at around 13,000 more than the usual daily figure.

March 28: Myanmar - Thailand earthquake

Myanmar’s military government said at least 1,002 people were killed and over 2,300 were injured. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a high-rise building under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing.

Centred near Mandalay, the quake was followed by a strong aftershock and damaged roads, a bridge and a dam, hampering rescue efforts in Myanmar, which is already grappling with civil war and a humanitarian crisis.

Tremors were felt in China’s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where houses were damaged, and people were injured near the Myanmar border.

April 1: Gujarat firecracker factory explosion

Most of those killed were migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh who had arrived only two days earlier and were staying with their families inside the premises.

Survivors and local sources said children as young as six were made to work with explosives for very low wages. They were assigned risky tasks such as tying fuses, packing gunpowder and assembling fireworks, often because their small hands were considered suitable for the work.

Many of those killed in Deesa had survived a similar firecracker factory explosion in Harda, Madhya Pradesh, in February 2024, highlighting how the same workers were exposed to deadly risks more than once.

April 22: Pahalgam terror attack

Around 3 PM, terrorists descended from the mountains of Baisaran Valley and opened fire on tourists in the area, known as 'mini Switzerland' for its scenic meadows. Panicked women were seen weeping and searching for their loved ones amid pools of blood as cries for help echoed across the valley.

The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Following the attack, the government suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, shut the Attari-Wagah border and halted visas.

India launched Operation Sindoor on May 6–7 in retaliation, targeting terror hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Indian officials later said over 100 terrorists were killed during the operation.

June 4: RCB’s victory celebrations turn tragic

The police had deployed a large contingent, but managing the crowd proved extremely difficult. The stadium had a capacity of holding 35,000 people, yet around 2 to 3 lakh fans showed up, far exceeding expectations.

Thousands of fans thronged the stadium and surrounding areas, overwhelming security personnel. Many attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to get a view of the players.

At Vidhana Soudha , Karnataka police used mild cane charges to disperse surging fans during the felicitation program. Panic spread quickly as crowds surged, with people scrambling to climb fences and trees in desperation.

June 12: Ahmedabad Air India crash

Both pilots, senior captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kunder, were fully cleared for duty, and the aircraft’s initial climb seemed normal.

and co-pilot Clive Kunder, were fully cleared for duty, and the aircraft’s initial climb seemed normal. However, within moments, a sudden loss of engine power triggered a series of events that the crew were unable to control.

The flight was carrying 242 people, including 229 passengers and 12 crew members, along with 19 people on the ground who were killed in the impact. The disaster left only one survivor, Indian-origin British national Vishwash Kumar Ramesh.

July 9: Texas Hill country flash flood

The disaster resulted in over 135 confirmed fatalities and estimated economic losses of approximately $1 billion.

Remnants of a tropical storm system stalled over the region, dumping record rainfall in short durations that overwhelmed the Colorado River basin.

The disaster exposed severe vulnerabilities in local drainage infrastructure, prompting a state-wide ""Flood Zone Reassessment"" by the Texas government.

August-September: Monsoon battered the subcontinent

Uttarakhand was hit by flash floods beginning August 5, a disaster that left over 70 people dead or missing, including 11 Indian Army soldiers. Cloudbursts in the Himalayas triggered massive landslides in Kishtwar and Chamoli.

In Punjab and Haryana, the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers overflowed, submerging hundreds of acres of paddy fields just before harvest. From mid to late August, Punjab grappled with the ""Great Punjab Flood"", the worst flood crisis since 1988. Over 1,400 villages were inundated, and the death toll in Punjab alone stood at 57, with over 3.5 million residents affected and 4.8 lakh acres of crops destroyed. The effect was seen in Pakistan too, where over 2 million people were displaced.

In late August, 138 people were killed in the Jammu division due to torrential downpours. Udhampur recorded a historic 629.4 mm of rain in 24 hours on August 27, shattering a record.

September 27: Karur stampede

During a rally for actor-turned-politician Vijay's party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures.

(TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures. The venue, which anticipated 15,000–30,000 attendees, saw a massive influx of over 50,000 people. The chaos was exacerbated by the leader's 7-hour delay, a failure of the sound system/microphones, and inadequate barricading along the Karur-Erode highway.

Rescue operations were severely hampered as the massive convoy of vehicles and the dense crowd blocked the entry of ambulances. Reports indicated that several attendees had already begun fainting from dehydration and heat exhaustion hours before the crush began.

October 21-October 31: Hurricane Melissa (Category 5)

The storm made a catastrophic landfall in Jamaica at New Hope on October 28, making it the most devastating landfall in history. with wind speeds exceeding 250 km/h, effectively shutting down the island's power grid for weeks. The slow-moving storm caused at least 45 deaths there and more than $130M in infrastructure damage, while over 90,000 people were displaced.

After devastating Jamaica, the storm battered Cuba and the Bahamas, and even though Melissa weakened before reaching here, Haiti suffered severely with 23 confirmed deaths and thousands displaced due to mudslides. The southern islands faced ""salt spray burn,"" where hurricane-force winds coated agricultural land in salt, destroying 80% of the local crop yield for the 2026 harvest season.

Insured losses were estimated at nearly $8 billion. The Caribbean tourism industry faced a complete seasonal shutdown, with cancellations extending well into 2026.

November 3: Northern Afghanistan earthquake

A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck near the border of Samangan and Balkh provinces at a depth of 28km, catching residents asleep in the early hours.

Reports confirmed over 20 fatalities and 300+ injuries, with the number rising as rescuers reached remote mountain villages cut off by landslides.

Significant damage was reported to historical infrastructure in Mazar-i-Sharif, including structural cracks in the outer walls of the Blue Mosque complex.

November 10: Red Fort car bomb blast

At 6:52 pm, a high-intensity vehicle-borne IED exploded in a white i20 car near Gate No. 1 of the Lal Qila Metro Station, just outside the historic Red Fort complex.

The powerful blast killed 15 people, mostly tourists and security personnel, injured dozens more, shattered windowpanes of buildings up to 500 metres away, and burned nearly a dozen nearby vehicles, including e-rickshaws and autos.

Intelligence agencies linked the attack to a ""doctor's module"" terror cell and utilised high-grade explosives, indicating sophisticated logistical support. Afterwards, the National Capital Region (NCR) was placed under a high-security grid. New checkpoints and facial recognition surveillance were permanently installed around all UNESCO heritage sites in Delhi.

November 26-December 2: Cyclone Ditwah

The storm stalled over the island nation of Sri Lanka, causing 410+ deaths and displacing nearly 230,000 people. The economic damage was estimated at $4.1 billion (approx. 4% of GDP).

In India, Chennai's IT corridor faced severe inundation, disrupting operations for global tech firms for 4 days. Reservoirs in coastal Andhra Pradesh breached, flooding the delta farmlands.

The receding waters triggered outbreaks of waterborne diseases in both countries, overwhelming local healthcare systems already strained by the monsoon.

December 14: Bondi Beach mass shooting

Two gunmen, a father and son, opened fire at the crowded beachfront event, resulting in 16 deaths, including one perpetrator, and creating mass panic among holidaymakers.

Authorities classified it as an ISIS-linked terror attack. Police recovered pipe bombs, other explosives and an ISIS flag from the truck belonging to the attackers at the scene that, fortunately, failed to fully detonate.

Australia declared a National Day of Reflection. The incident led to an immediate bipartisan review of hate-group designations and stricter monitoring of online radicalisation hubs.

December 2-December 15: Indigo airline operational collapse

December 3 marked the ""initial meltdown"" phase, where the airline was forced to cancel roughly 200 flights in a single day, signalling the start of a week-long systemic failure. 2 days later, the cancellation number rose to over 1000 flights.

IndiGo's size, high night-flight dependence, and razor-thin utilisation margins made recovery slower than expected. When one pilot timed out, it triggered a 'domino effect.' As IndiGo was packed with passengers but no pilots, fares for other aviation giants also went up.

Major airports saw queues of passengers lined up, as some waited for over 12 hours. The crisis struck many major cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. However, operations normalised later following the government's introduction of a price cap and DGCA’s probe.

December 6: Goa nightclub fire

The fire broke out at approximately 11:45 PM on a Saturday night during a crowded dance party. While initially thought to be a gas cylinder explosion, investigators later confirmed the fire was triggered by the improper use of indoor electrical firecrackers and spread within seconds due to dried palm leaves.

The tragedy was particularly lethal because the building lacked emergency exits, and the main entrance was a narrow lane that prevented fire trucks from getting closer than 400 meters. 23 of the 25 victims died of smoke inhalation/suffocation rather than burns.

The Magisterial Inquiry revealed the club's trade license had expired in March 2024. Meanwhile, the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, flew to Phuket, Thailand, but were arrested after an Interpol Blue Corner Notice.

Murphy’s law worked hard in 2025.A year full of “what else can go wrong”, and then the wrong proceeds to make its way in, perfectly settling down, even stretching through months. A year that felt like a series of hypnic jerks, rather than just dates or headlines changing.Not to sound pessimistic, but 2025, ultimately, became a collision of the good, the bad and the devastating. India celebrated moments of pride — sporting triumphs, economic reforms, scientific milestones — even as it grappled with stampedes, terror attacks, aviation disasters and climate-fuelled catastrophes at home and abroad.At least 12 people were killed in a tragic railway accident in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district on January 22 after panic spread over a rumour of fire onboard the Lucknow–Mumbai Pushpak Express.Maha Kumbh, the event that literally drew people from across India and the world to Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. Politicians, business leaders, film stars and millions of devotees gathered along the riverbanks, hoping for a calm and spiritual start to the year.The tragedy does not end here. Days later, another stampede claimed lives, this time at New Delhi Railway Station, where at least 18 people, including 14 women and three children, were killed and several others were left injured.On March 28, Myanmar and Thailand were shaken by a 7.7-magnitude earthquake, causing widespread damage to buildings and key infrastructure.A powerful explosion at a firecracker factory and godown in Deesa, north Gujarat, on April 1 claimed 21 lives, with the impact so severe that body parts were found up to 300 metres away.A pleasant vacation in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam turned tragic when 26 people, including one Nepali citizen, died in a terror attack. Terrorists opened fire in Baisaran Valley on April 22, marking one of the deadliest attacks in the Kashmir Valley since the Pulwama carnage in 2019.What was meant to be a celebration turned deadly when a stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on June 4 killed 11 people and injured more than 30 during RCB’s first-ever IPL title celebrations.A tragic crash of Air India Flight AI 171 on June 12 claimed 260 lives when the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plunged seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad on its way to London. The aircraft struck the hostel of Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College, where young doctors were having their lunch.On July 9, parts of Texas were submerged under rapid floodwaters, after an intense storm system, marking an ominous start to the second half of the year.From August through September, the Indian subcontinent was brought to a standstill by a devastatingly erratic monsoon season. Torrential rains, landslides and cloudbursts wrecked havoc in northern India and other regions.A political rally, a superstar and a huge turnout of people. A scene unfolded on September 27, with a thought: what could have possibly gone wrong? Except that a lot of it did. It only needs a special infrastructure to manage a massive crowd stretched over 2km. 39 people, including many women and children, never made it out alive. Multiple injuries and trauma for many more affected.The Caribbean region saw devastation in the form of one of the most powerful storms of the decade. Rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm, Melissa began its trail from October 21 as a tropical storm, gradually upgrading into a Category 1 storm in four days. However, within two days, the storm rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm, causing historical devastation.Deep within the Hindu Kush’s tectonic fault lines, a seismic jolt shook the northern Afghanistan region. This crisis triggered massive landslides, severing vital transit corridors and cutting power across provinces. Settlements crumbled during the late-night tremor, and international monitoring agencies issued orange alert through the PAGER system.A busy evening on November 10 turned out to be a day that would shake the entire nation. A terror incident in the heart of New Delhi that shattered the nation's capital. An attack that later went on to uncover a far more disturbing truth, a “white coat nexus”.

One that stood in a direction opposite to the safety and security of the people they were meant to serve.From November 26 to December 2, 2025, a weak but hydrologically catastrophic tropical storm unleashed unprecedented rainfall on Sri Lanka and Southern India.A happy gathering for “Chanukah by the sea” at one of the most popular beaches in Sydney fell prone to one of the most horrific terror attacks. Bondi Beach, a tourist hotspot, became the location witnessing one of the darkest days for the country on December 14.December began with aviation troubles that crippled peak holiday season travelling, triggering nationwide chaos. One of India’s largest carriers by market share, IndiGo, fell into an operational crisis, after which began a series of delayed flights, cancellations, and much more!The Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Arpora, North Goa, is recorded as one of the deadliest fire tragedies in the state's history. Occurring on December 6, at the peak of the 2025 tourist season, the incident exposed a massive web of illegalities and administrative failures.2025 tested the resilience, the limits across borders and institutions. It also forced uncomfortable reckonings. Each tragedy sparked questions that could no longer be postponed about preparedness, accountability, infrastructure, governance and collective responsibility. In many cases, they also triggered change: tighter safety norms, renewed probes, policy corrections, and communities stepping up for one another in moments of collapse.Each tragedy, each crisis has only strengthened the bounce-backs. Pandemic felt like 'the story' to tell the succeeding generation, but the reel is ongoing, and the list goes on.As the year draws to a close, the grief it leaves behind is undeniable, but so is the resolve it has shaped. If 2025 was a reminder of how fragile life and systems can be, it was also a quiet call to build better — with memory, empathy and caution guiding the road ahead.","The month-long Prayagraj Maha Kumbh Mela saw tens of millions of pilgrims arrive, with authorities estimating that nearly 10 crore devotees turned up on Mauni Amavasya alone.

'Deeply Concerned': PM Modi Reacts To Reports Of Attack On Putin’s House, Ukraine Responds

Russia claims Putin targetted in attack

Third day of powercuts for Ukrainians after Russian attack

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over reports that the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been targeted and called for restraint and a renewed focus on diplomacy.In a post on X, PM Modi said he was 'deeply concerned' by the reports and stressed that diplomatic engagement remained the best way forward. ""Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation. Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,"" he said.Russia earlier claimed that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on President Putin’s state residence located between Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Reuters, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov alleged that 91 long-range drones were fired at the residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Lavrov described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said Moscow would revise its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war.He added that Russia had already selected targets in Ukraine for what he called “retaliation strikes.”Ukraine rejected the accusation. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russia’s claims as “lies,” alleging that Moscow was using the narrative to justify further attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, as well as Russia’s refusal to take necessary steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.He added that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, accusing Russia of doing the opposite, and urged the international community not to remain silent as efforts continue toward achieving a lasting peace.For three days following the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, residents have been without electricity or heating in Vyshhorod, a satellite town about 20 km north of Kyiv.As night-time temperatures fall to around minus 3 degrees Celsius, they spend much of the day in a small shelter equipped with heat and electricity, where they can also power their gadgets and devices.Around 20 people gather in the modest building—described on a sign outside as an “islet of warmth and power”—charging mobile phones and laptops to stay connected and continue working.","PM Modi says he is 'deeply concerned' by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a move to curb the spread of anti-national propaganda, a designated NIA court in Srinagar on Tuesday issued a proclamation against three Kashmiris, in an FIR registered by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK). Investigators have established their alleged role in propagating content deemed prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India. The court directed them to appear before it by Jan 31, 2026.The proclamation was issued against Mubeen Ahmad Shah, Azizul Hassan Ashai alias Tony Ashai, both residents of Srinagar, and Rifat Wani of Kupwara.

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Supported by RMZ Foundation and IAF with curatorial Advisor Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the Great Hedge of India.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”",'Salt Lines' is the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires. The show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the Great Hedge of India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126206642,imgsize-269872,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-27t221614743.jpg"

PM Modi also recalled his “warm meeting"" with her in Dhaka in 2015. ""We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,” he said.Zia who was Bangladesh's first woman prime minister and also the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, passed away on Tuesday. She was 80. She played a major role in restoring democracy after a period of tumultuous military rule and dominated the country's politics for decades.Her long political career, marked by periods in prison and house arrest, was shaped by a fierce rivalry with Hasina. She was cleared of corruption charges and permitted to travel to London for medical treatment only after Hasina’s exit from office.She was planning to contest the February parliamentary elections, which will be Bangladesh’s first polls since the popular uprising in late 2024 that removed Sheikh Hasina from power.The BNP is widely seen as a strong contender in the upcoming elections following the collapse of Sheikh Hasina’s government which had maintained close ties with New Delhi.","India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will attend the funeral of Bangladesh's former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka tomorrow.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police have detained four 17-year-old school dropouts for hacking a 20-year-old migrant worker from Odisha with sickles near abandoned railway quarters in Tiruttani, a temple town on Chennai's northwestern fringe, after filming the assault to post as a social media reel.The victim, K Suraj, recently arrived in Chennai following a family dispute and had been surviving on menial jobs, police said Monday.The attack unfolded Saturday evening aboard a Chennai-Tiruttani EMU local train. At Thiruvalangadu station, about 70km northwest of Chennai, the four juveniles boarded Suraj's compartment, allegedly drunk & carrying two sickles concealed in bags. Investigators said they planned to use the weapons while recording content for social media.A brief exchange in Hindi escalated into an argument that continued until the train reached Tiruttani station, around 90km from Chennai. After disembarking, the youths allegedly forced Suraj towards the railway quarters near the tracks. Three attacked him with sickles, with one flashing a ""victory sign"", while a fourth recorded the assault on a mobile phone, police said.Suraj suffered deep cut wounds. Bleeding heavily, he staggered to a nearby road, where passers-by alerted railway police.

'Called Chinki, Chinese, Momo': Tripura Student’s Killing In Dehradun Triggers Protests Across State

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

Aishwarya Sengar's big charge after SC order in Unnao case

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing. We have been stripped of our dignity, our peace, and even our fundamental right to be heard. Still hope for justice. I request that the media not spread any misinformation,” Aishwarya said.","Ishita Sengar penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith” Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

NEW DELHI: Union minister Ramdas Athawale on Tuesday termed his party RPI(A)’s exclusion from Mahayuti seat-sharing seat-sharing for BMC polls as ""betrayal of trust"". He said that his party would contest on 38 seats, however, adding that he would ""support the BJP and Shiv Sena on other seats. """"Since the formation of the Mahayuti, we have stood by the alliance with complete sincerity and firmness. However, what has happened today regarding seat-sharing is nothing but a betrayal of trust,"" he said in a post on X.Taking a stand for the ""dignity"" of party workers, Athawale released the candidate list and said that it is ""absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance.""""The BJP offered a proposal for just 7 seats late at night, but putting up candidates in new locations at the eleventh hour is now impossible. Even though our strength in Mumbai is greater than that of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), we were sidelined in the seat allocation, which has caused intense resentment among RPI workers across Maharashtra. We are not like other leaders who repeatedly twist words or change their stance as it suits them.Fundamentally, we cannot accept any compromise that forgets the party, the workers, and their self-respect, because the workers' strength is the party's true strength,"" he said.""Therefore, we will not take any stance that puts the workers' dignity and the party's existence at stake. Our word and our loyalty are rock-solid. From a broader perspective, it is absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance and, through that, to keep the work for the common people going unceasingly. It is with this seriousness in mind that we have decided to stay with the MahaYuti. Many more decisions can be taken after the election results, but it is now clear that we will contest 'friendly fights' on 38 to 39 seats. Even though our support for the MahaYuti remains firm, on these seats the RPI will demonstrate its strength,"" he added.BJP MLC Pravin Darekar met Athawale and later, speaking to the reporters, he said that ""his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner.""""Ramdas Athawale is not upset; he is with the Mahayuti alliance. But he has his own party, so there is pressure from his party workers. Every party's workers feel they should contest the elections... There are 227 seats and thousands of workers who are interested in contesting elections... I believe that after discussing this with the chief minister, his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner,"" he said.Even as the BJP and Shiv Sena have declared a seat-sharing arrangement, another Mahayuti ally—the NCP led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar—is fighting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections on its own.Meanwhile, the last date for filing nomination papers for the January 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra ends on Tuesday.","Ramdas Athawale's party RPI(A) excluded from Mahayuti seat-sharing seat- sharing for BMC polls.

We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,"" he said, citing a host of measures.Asking investors to keep trusting India and investing in its people, he said in a post on LinkedIn, that the country's youthful demography is the prime engine of ""Reform Express"", a term he first used earlier this month during Parliament's winter session to underscore his govt's commitment to fast-paced reforms across sectors.These reforms, which included opening up of nuclear sector to private players, higher education, 100% FDI in insurance sector, and introduction of four labour codes to cover a complex web of 29 laws, were designed with empathy, recognising the realities of small businesses, young professionals, farmers, workers and the middle class.""They were shaped by consultation, guided by data and anchored in India's constitutional values.They add momentum to our decade-long efforts to move away from a control-based economy to one that operates within a framework of trust, keeping the citizen at its core. These reforms are aimed towards building a prosperous and self-reliant India,"" he said. He emphasised that his govt will continue pursuing the reform agenda in the coming years.Amid opposition's determined protest against his govt's decision to bring G RAM G Act in replace UPA-era MGNREGA, he said provisions of the new law raise employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days, resulting in increased spending towards strengthening village infrastructure and livelihoods.In Parliament's monsoon session, he said five landmark maritime legislations were passed to simplify documentation, make dispute resolution easier and reduce logistics costs, replacing outdated Acts.Modi said GST slab rationalisation will ensure dispute reduction and better compliance and has boosted consumer sentiment and demand, while tax break for individuals earning upto Rs 12 lakh is an ""unparalleled relief for the middle class"". These reforms mark India's move towards a transparent, technology-driven tax administration, he said.Modi said that trade deals with New Zealand, Oman and Britain will add to investments, job creation and encourage local entrepreneurs.He said a bill introduced in Parliament will lead to establishment of a single, unified higher education regulator in 'Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan' to replace overlapping bodies (UGC, AICTE and NCTE, etc). ""Institutional autonomy will be strengthened, with innovation and research boosted,"" he said.In a boost to small and medium businesses, the definition of ""small companies"" has been expanded to include firms with turnovers up to Rs 100 crore, reducing compliance burdens and associated costs for thousands of firms. Another bill will enhance governance norms in Sebi and investor protection.","The outgoing year (2025) will be remembered for India's focus on reforms as a continuous national mission, PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday. He asserted that his govt prioritised collaboration over control and facilitation over regulation in the true spirit of a modern democracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126261622,imgsize-1358473,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi.jpg"

'Want approachable people's courts'

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Now, lawyers can't argue for days in high-stake cases

NEW DELHI: If a citizen faces a legal emergency or is threatened with arrest by probe agencies at unearthly hours, the person will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night for protection of fundamental rights and liberties, the Chief Justice of India said.""My endeavour is and will be to make the Supreme Court and high courts people's courts which can be approached at any time beyond working hours in legal emergencies,"" CJI Surya Kant told TOI.The CJI said one of his priorities is to set up as many constitution benches as possible to deal with pending petitions raising several important constitutional issues - like the one thrown up by a bunch of petitions challenging validity of special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which started from Bihar and is now being carried out in a dozen states. The bench on SIR would take up the issues after conclusion of the countrywide updation of electoral rolls.CJI Kant said he would also examine the feasibility of setting up a nine-judge bench to decide many petitions that articulate the clash between religious freedom and women's rights. The issue arises in three categories of cases, including petitions seeking review of the SC order allowing women of all ages into Sabarimala temple.By custom, women of menstruating age were barred from going inside Sabarimala shrine. Another set of pleas challenge the practice of female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and the ban on entry of women into mosques, and, the third set question denial of entry into Agiary (Zoroastrian temple) of Parsi women who marry outside the community.In another significant development, it would no longer be permissible for renowned lawyers to argue for days together in high-stake matters. CJI Surya Kant has decided to enforce strict timelines for advocates to complete arguments.""The constitutional courts will function like hospitals with emergency wards. In case of a legal emergency, a citizen, irrespective of status, can knock on the doors of Supreme Court even at midnight to seek redress of an urgent grievance and seek protection of individual rights and liberty,"" CJI Kant said.There will never be another case like the one arising from settlement dispute between Ambani brothers in which lawyers argued for 26 days in SC. ""This is to ensure that poor litigants not only get free legal assistance but also an equal share of court time during hearing of their cases,"" the CJI said.Apart from mandatory submission of written submissions not exceeding five pages at least three days prior to the hearing, SC has issued a circular saying, ""Senior advocates, arguing counsel and/or advocate-on-record, shall submit the timelines for making oral arguments in all post-notice and regular hearing matters, at least a day prior to the commencement of the hearing of the case.""To speed up hearing in pending cases, the CJI said, ""Various special categories have been identified for priority listing to send a message that Supreme Court is a people's court.""",Chief Justice of India Surya Kant wants constitutional courts to be 'people's courts' Citizens will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night.

Bangladesh's first woman PM to embattled mass leader

JALPAIGURI: Grief over former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia's death on Tuesday travelled well beyond Dhaka, reaching Jalpaiguri, a north Bengal town nearly 434 km away, where memories of her early life still lingered. For the people here, it was a loss of one of their own.Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town, attending two primary schools before her family eventually moved to what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.""Zia's father, Mohammad Iskandar, used to work as an agent at my father's tea trading firm, Das & Co. Khaleda Zia was born at their Nayabasti house in the town. Even after Partition, her family continued to reside in Jalpaiguri, and family moved to erstwhile East Pakistan only in the 1950s,"" recounted Jalpaiguri resident and businessman Nilanjan Dasgupta.According to Jalpaiguri-based historian Umesh Sharma, Zia's early education began in the town. ""Zia was sent to Jogmaya Primary School in Nayabasti, where she studied up to Class III, and was then admitted to Sunitibala Sadar Girls' School in Samaj Para,"" he said. ""By then most of their relatives moved to East Pakistan, and Zia's father migrated there,"" Sharma added.Sharma said the family's departure followed a formal exchange of property.""Iskandar went for a property exchange with one Amarendranath Chakraborty and moved to East Pakistan. Chakraborty's family still lives in the house at Nayabasti,"" he said.Those who remember her family recall the emotional ties that endured long after her departure. ""Siyon Mandal, who became a teacher at Sishu Niketan Prathamik Bidyalaya, was her best friend during primary school days. I remember how Siyondi was elated when Zia came to office in Bangladesh. The news of her demise has left people who knew her sorry,"" said Dasgupta, a former proprietor of now-defunct Das & Co.Neighbours, too, spoke of a bond that survived borders and decades. ""Zia's niece came only a couple of months ago to see Zia's birthplace. We talked about how good it would have been if the country was never partitioned. Her loss is mourned by people in Bangladesh as well as here,"" said Suhrid Mandal, Zia's Jalpaiguri neighbour.","Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town.

Spirit without the spirits: The coolest New Year party is now hangover-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spirit-without-the-spirits-the-coolest-new-year-party-is-now-hangover-free/articleshow/126259642.cms,"Motta Maadi Music Sober Party, started by Chennai-based musician Badhri Narayanan Seshadri, is a New Year’s concert for teetotaller

'Wanted to show how one can have fun without booze'

For years, New Year's Eve came with a familiar script: you drink, you party, you recover (or regret it) later. But a growing number of Indians are now opting for a 'sober' start to 2026. ""There was a time I drank to drown my sorrows,"" says 45-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur Madhu Gupta. This New Year's Eve, though, her plans look very different: an early dinner at a hotel, followed by a 'Stranger Things' marathon with her teenage daughter. Alcohol doesn't figure anywhere. Even her 30-year-old niece in Bengaluru is skipping the usual party scene.Gupta and her niece are part of a growing global sober curious movement - people who are reshaping their relationship with alcohol. For some, it means giving it up entirely and for others, it might mean a shift to low-alcohol options. Health reasons and the desire to have more meaningful interactions/experiences without being wasted are driving the shift.For this crowd, the perfect Dec 31 is about music, community, and being home before the streets get wild. That's the spirit behind the Motta Maadi Music Sober Party, started by Chennai-based musician Badhri Narayanan Seshadri as a mischievous jab at New Year's excesses.Seshadri is quick to clarify that it wasn't planned as an anti-alcohol event. ""The entire team is largely teetotallers, so this is how we celebrate. Otherwise, where do teetotallers go on Dec 31? Watch television?"" he laughs. This year, their Dec 31 show will be held at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall, with two performances at 3pm and 7pm, both featuring Tamil film music. The evening ends not with a countdown. ""We finish with 'Ilamai Idho Idho', a popular New Year song by Ilaiyaraaja,"" says Seshadri.The shift is also showing up in how venues are programming the night. In Hyderabad, rooftop cafe Ce La Vie is advertising a 'sober and sensational' New Year's party complete with a DJ, a midnight countdown and an elaborate mocktail menu. In Indore, Kaner Baag is hosting a sober New Year's Eve built around a familiar party template - a DJ night, live dhol, unlimited buffet, zero-proof cocktails and a midnight countdown with fireworks - just without the booze. The event is aimed at ""families, couples and groups looking for a safe, elegant, and premium alternative to crowded club parties"".For 21-year-old Raj Dashore, a partner at Kaner Baag and one of the organisers, the idea is a pushback against how celebrations in the city have changed over generations. ""In our parents' generation, drinking became the centre of every celebration in Indore. Every month, there's a new pub launching,"" he says. ""At Kaner Baag, we wanted to show that you can be surrounded by nature, have fun and feel calm without alcohol. ""Dry doesn't mean dull. Across the country, mixologists are leaning into technique-driven creations - think beetroot negronis and kiwi collins - designed to deliver flavour, not buzz.Hyderabad-based Meera Girija Tadimeti, an architect-turned-chef who specialises in homestyle Telugu food, says this New Year's Eve she will simply sip sparkling water or soda. ""There is more research now that shows no amount of alcohol is safe, so I made a conscious decision to say no to alcohol,"" says Tadimeti, who was a social drinker earlier. ""I don't succumb to social pressure and respect my body's limitations,"" she adds.Others are stepping away from the pressure to ""do something big"" altogether. Instead of hosting traditional New Year's Eve events, Kolkata's The Barge Company is planning a 'River Reset' weekend on Jan 3, 4 and 11 aboard its heritage vessels, Riviera and the restored Bengal Paddle. ""The first weekend of Jan should be a sober weekend. We wanted to do that by channelling the tranquillity of the river with activities like sound bath, yoga flow and iceberg mind mastery on the cruise,"" say Rishika Das Roy, marketing director at The Barge Company. ""As for drinks, we will have tea-tasting and mushroom coffee,"" she says.",A growing number of Indians are opting for a'sober' start to 2026.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah predicted Tuesday a BJP govt in Bengal with a two-thirds majority in the 2026 assembly polls, while promising to end infiltration and seeking to calm fears among the Matua community over EC's special intensive revision of electoral rolls and the Citizenship Amendment Act.""BJP has resolved that when it forms govt after April 2026, it will restore Bengal's lost glory,"" Shah said during a 40-minute interaction with reporters. ""Development has come to a halt. Fear and corruption have become the identity of the state... We will uproot Trinamool Congress .""Shah traced BJP's rise in Bengal from two Lok Sabha seats and 17% vote share a decade ago to 18 seats in 2019 and 77 assembly seats in 2021, asserting Congress and CPM had been reduced to zero.

""Matuas have no reason to be afraid. Refugees who came to Bengal are citizens of India and nobody can harm them - not even Mamata Banerjee,"" he said.BJP functionaries said that of nearly 1.5 crore Matuas in Bengal, about 70,000 have applied for citizenship under CAA.Shah accused the TMC-led govt of blocking border fencing by not allotting land to BSF. ""I have sent seven letters... there was no response,"" he said. ""Infiltration is happening on Mamata Banerjee's watch. Forged documents are being prepared. Demography is changing to strengthen her vote bank.""Shah also targeted TMC over alleged corruption, naming Partha Chatterjee, Jyotipriya Mallick and Anubrata Mandal, and referring to allegations against Firhad Hakim and Sovan Chattopadhyay. ""Yet Didi says there is no corruption,"" Shah said.He claimed women's safety was at risk and people were told not to step out after 7pm.

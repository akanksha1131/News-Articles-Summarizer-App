'India is proving it’s possible': US chief calls on President Murmu; praises clean energy push at AI Summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-is-proving-its-possible-us-chief-calls-on-president-murmu-praises-clean-energy-push-at-ai-summit/articleshow/128632756.cms,"'Can't Wait For Trump To Go': Hillary Clinton Hails India, Pushes Others For Climate Change Moves

Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive. He urged countries to prepare, protect, and invest in people, noting that international cooperation is currently strained by declining trust and rising technological rivalry.

During his visit, Guterres also highlighted India's initiatives to expand clean energy access and appreciated the country's leadership in convening the AI Impact Summit, as well as its longstanding collaboration with the United Nations across sectors.

At Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu welcomed Guterres’ proposal to establish a global scientific panel on artificial intelligence to serve all of humanity, according to an official release. She reaffirmed India’s commitment to multilateralism at a time when global uncertainties are placing the system under strain.

The President observed that multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations Security Council, must undergo urgent reform to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. She stressed that the existing framework of the Security Council is outdated and that the Global South must be given a greater voice in global decision-making. Reform, she said, is key to preserving the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations.

While acknowledging that the UN-80 initiative offers a useful platform for reform, President Murmu emphasised that any restructuring exercise must safeguard the developmental priorities of the Global South.

She concluded the meeting by extending her good wishes to Guterres for the remainder of his tenure and reiterating India’s full support for multilateralism and international cooperation.","Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive.

‘Mahanagar stn was part of Metro plan but dropped later’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahanagar-stn-was-part-of-metro-plan-but-dropped-later/articleshow/128622676.cms,"Lucknow: Did you know that the Mahanagar area of the city was part of the Metro route in the original alignment plan, but was dropped later? A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report tabled in the state Assembly on Friday revealed that Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.The CAG report states that in Dec 2013, the central govt had granted pre-approval for Phase-1A of the Lucknow Metro . The DPR, an MOU between the Centre and UP govt, the finance contract with the European investment bank (EIB), and the project agreement with EIB all specified the construction of 22 stations along the 23-km corridor.According to the DPR, Mahanagar station was projected to get the third-highest passenger footfall in 2015 and the second highest by 2020. A source in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said the area has two separate wards (Mahanagar and Vivekananda Puri) with over one lakh population.However, the audit found that the executing company -- UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) -- built only 21 stations, dropping Mahanagar from the alignment. No evidence was produced to show that any proposal for its exclusion was placed before the central or state govts nor any approval was obtained, the report says.The CAG noted that bypassing the sanctioned DPR violated multiple binding documents — DPR, MoU, finance contract, and the project agreement — and deprived the Mahanagar area of a key Metro facility despite projected high ridership.In Sept 2024, the state govt claimed that the change was not concealed, stating that the ministry of housing and urban affairs had notified the alignment with 21 stations after examining it against the original DPR.The CAG found state govt response unconvincing, noting that while the UPMRC informed MoHUA about other major alterations — such as changing the proposed elevated station at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport to an underground one — it failed to disclose the removal of Mahanagar station. The audit stressed that any deviation from the approved DPR required a separate, explicit approval from the GoI along with justification, which was neither sought nor granted.Reacting to the CAG report, the UPMRC told TOI that station locations were optimised by dropping Mahanagar. It was appropriate to have both stations 'IT Chauraha' and 'Badshah Nagar' closer to Mahanagar. Usually 1km distance has been maintained between each station.","Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.

As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries, reports Kalyan Das. Members of the diaspora told TOI that many families back home are grappling with grief following recent anti-regime protests and the deaths of loved ones, leading to a marked shift in how the holy month is being observed. Mohammed (who asked to be identified by his first name), an Iranian who has been living in Delhi for nearly a decade, said conversations with his family reflect deep anguish and anger. “How could we mark the month when there have been so many deaths during the recent anti-regime protests?” he said.As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings. Ramadan feels different,” she said.Helma, an Iranian based in Hyderabad, pointed to economic hardship as another reason behind the subdued atmosphere. “Many people cannot afford basic food items. There is also anxiety over a possible war with the US, which people fear would worsen the situation. In such circumstances, people are struggling to focus on religious observances,” she added.In Dec last year, demonstrations broke out across several cities in Iran amid widespread unrest directed at the govt and mounting economic distress. The upheaval was described by observers as the most significant challenge to the establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The subsequent security crackdown involved the use of live ammunition against protesters.Rights groups and activists have alleged that the violence led to tens of thousands of deaths, describing it as among the deadliest episodes in the country’s modern history.","As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran.

Bishnoi gang makes Rs10cr extortion call to Cong Akola MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bishnoi-gang-makes-rs10cr-extortion-call-to-cong-akola-mla/articleshow/128622329.cms,"Akola: Two back-to-back extortion threats, allegedly linked to Bishnoi gang, demanding Rs10 crore from Congress's Akola MLA and Rs2 crore from a BJP leader in Akot have put the law enforcement agencies on alert.Akola West Congress MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received extortion call demanding ₹10 crore from Bishnoi gang associate Shubham Lonkar, police said. Following the threat, the MLA's security has been enhanced. The development comes close on the heels of a separate case in which Akot BJP city president Harish Tawari was allegedly threatened through Signal messaging app.According to police, Tawari first received a message on Feb 12 asking him to arrange Rs2 crore by collecting it from Akot BJP MLA Prakash Bharsakale. Based on Tawari's complaint, a case has been registered with the cyber police station in Akola. Investigators have treated the message as a serious extortion threat and launched a probe.MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received a phone call demanding ₹10 crore. Police sources said the call was received on Feb 17 at around 3pm, and the caller allegedly warned the MLA to pay the amount within two days or face severe consequences.Investigators have traced the origin of the call to California, US.Following the threat, Pathan's security has been tightened and four armed police personnel have been deployed for his protection. After the call, the MLA met Akola superintendent of police Archit Chandak and other senior officers and formally lodged a complaint.Police said Lonkar is a native of Nevri Budruk village in Akot taluka of Akola district. The fact that a BJP city office-bearer and a Congress MLA were allegedly targeted by the same network has caused serious concern within the Akola police establishment.Who is Shubham Lonkar?According to police records, Lonkar had earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, and later for the firing incident outside the residence of filmmaker Rohit Shetty.Lonkar had earlier been arrested by Akola police, who seized three pistols and live cartridges from his possession. Investigators believe he was in contact with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi.Police said Lonkar was a key operator in a weapons-trafficking racket. In the same case, Akot police had also arrested three persons who allegedly procured firearms through him.Investigators further said Lonkar had been living in Pune's Warje area for some time before going absconding. He was later arrested from Pune and subsequently released on bail.Police also claim to possess call recordings of conversations between Lonkar and Lawrence Bishnoi. Agencies believe Lonkar's network extends to Dubai and other international criminal links.

"For some Gujarat groups, parental consent for marriage written in ‘constitution’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-some-gujarat-groups-parental-consent-for-marriage-written-in-constitution/articleshow/128631922.cms,"A Patidar community meeting last month in Mehsana. Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years.

Why Was Basic Mathematics Introduced?

Standard vs Basic: Where Did the Difference Blur?

Allegations of Tricky and Out-of-Syllabus Questions

The Viral Reaction: Effort vs Expectation

Competency-Based Reform and the Trust Question

Trust in a High-Stakes System

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 Mathematics examination this year has triggered intense debate across classrooms, staff rooms and social media timelines. While the Standard paper has largely been described as direct and NCERT-based, students who opted for Basic Mathematics have voiced deep dissatisfaction, with many claiming that the paper did not match its declared level.For over 20 lakh students who appear for the Class 10 board examinations annually, even a single paper can influence subject choices, confidence and future pathways. Within hours of the exam, complaints flooded social media platforms. Parents of average and below-average learners expressed concern that students who consciously chose Basic Mathematics to avoid academic pressure were instead pushed to the edge.CBSE introduced Basic and Standard Mathematics in 2020 to create a structured academic choice. Students not planning to pursue Mathematics in Class 11 were given the option of Basic — designed to reduce stress and avoid advanced theoretical depth.However, this year’s controversy has reopened the debate on whether that distinction was clearly reflected.Neera Sharma, PGT Mathematics at GSKV Khajoori Khas, Delhi, emphasised the intent behind the policy: “Basic Mathematics was introduced to reduce stress for students who do not intend to pursue Mathematics in higher classes. If the framing becomes layered and analytical beyond expectation, the distinction between Basic and Standard begins to blur.”Echoing similar concerns, Sanjay Sharma, TGT Mathematics at Raghubar Dayal Jan Kalyan Government Co-Education Senior Secondary School, Bhajanpura, Delhi, said: “If a student opts for Basic, the expectation is that questions will be direct and simple. When the framing becomes tricky, students feel the level is not matching the label.”For many educators, the issue is not whether the questions were technically within syllabus, but whether the cognitive demand matched the purpose of the Basic category.Teachers analysing both papers observed that the Standard paper remained largely aligned with direct NCERT practice.Sanjay Sharma explained: “The Standard paper was direct from NCERT and of easy level. Theorem-based questions were simple — the theorem was given and students had to apply it directly. But in the Basic paper, questions were more tricky and lengthy.”He pointed specifically to Section E: “In Standard, case study questions were straightforward. In Basic, they required extra interpretation. Question number 38 from Trigonometry was easy in Standard but quite tough in Basic.”He also noted variation across sets: “Set 3 was tough because the MCQs required proper method and full calculation. Sets 1 and 2 were comparatively manageable. Since Mathematics was the first paper, anxiety was already high.”Detailed reactions also came from Government Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (GSKV), Khajoori Khas, Delhi.Anshu Singh, TGT Mathematics at GSKV Khajoori Khas, said: “There were no direct questions. Many were tricky and confusing. The geometry questions did not clearly match the examples students practised from NCERT.”She highlighted Questions 21, 31, 32 (both parts), 36 and 38 as particularly unexpected for Basic level.Neetu, TGT Mathematics at the same school, observed: “The case study questions demanded deeper analysis. For Basic students, the framing was not as straightforward as it should have been.”Neera Sharma, reiterated her concerns while analysing the geometry section: “Some of the geometry questions, including the shaded region in Question 34, were not expected at Basic level. Students were not prepared for that kind of presentation.”According to her, even though CBSE has not declared the question out-of-syllabus, the structure of Question 34 — based on a shaded region — surprised many students, especially since related practice exercises had reportedly been reduced in classroom focus.The debate intensified after a video of a Class 10 student who opted for Basic Mathematics went viral. The student expressed emotional distress, stating she had prepared rigorously from multiple guidebooks in less than two months — including the NCERT textbook, RD Sharma, RS Aggarwal, Together with Mathematics, Oswaal and Educart question banks.Her core concern was not lack of preparation but mismatch. She felt the questions did not resemble the direct formats she had repeatedly practised. Instead, the paper required interpretation, application and layered thinking.For many Basic students, preparation often revolves around mastering familiar patterns. When those patterns shift towards competency-based framing, the emotional impact can be significant.CBSE has gradually increased the proportion of competency-based questions to test conceptual clarity rather than rote memorisation. From a reform perspective, this shift is intentional.However, the controversy highlights a delicate balance. If Basic students perceive the paper as comparable in complexity to Standard, the credibility of differentiation is questioned.Neera Sharma offered a broader reflection: “Difficulty alone does not make a paper unfair. But expectations matter. If the level does not appear consistent with what students were told to expect, confidence is affected.”At the same time, educators remain divided. Some maintain the paper was within syllabus and conceptually sound. Others argue that framing and accessibility are just as important as syllabus coverage.Ultimately, this debate goes beyond one paper.• Who audits whether question papers truly match declared difficulty levels?• If Basic begins to resemble Standard in cognitive demand, does the distinction lose meaning?• In a high-stakes examination system, can even one unclear paper influence academic confidence and stream choices?Sanjay Sharma, said: “Even one tricky or unexpected paper can shake a student’s confidence, especially when they chose Basic expecting simpler questions. Labels mean nothing if the content does not match the promise.”Labels carry responsibility. If “Basic” promises reduced complexity, it must consistently reflect that promise in design and framing.As the board examinations continue, the larger issue remains — in a system impacting over 20 lakh students annually, clarity of intent, transparency in assessment and alignment between policy and practice are not optional. They are essential to maintaining trust.","CBSE introduced Basic and Standard Mathematics in 2020 to create a structured academic choice.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers. A cop said: ""This shocking episode comes at a time when community-living residences for senior citizens are gaining popularity in Bengaluru.""","Nageshwar Rao, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning.

‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.

RAIPUR: A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump after a youth allegedly set a fuel nozzle ablaze using a lighter when asked not to smoke, that triggered flames on a motorcycle and pump. Amid panic, the pump staff averted a major disaster and doused it with a fire extinguisher.The incident took place at a petrol pump in the Urla area on Thursday evening. According to police, two men identified as Dharmendra Kshatri and Imran had arrived at the pump on a motorcycle to refuel.Police said Imran remained seated on the bike while Dharmendra stood nearby. As the fuel tank was opened, Dharmendra allegedly took out a cigarette and tried to light it. When he was asked to stop smoking at the petrol pump, he became enraged and used a lighter to ignite the fuel nozzle pipe, triggering flames.The fire quickly spread to the bike’s fuel tank and the pump machine, causing panic at the site. The two accused, the biker and pump staff rushed away to save themselves as flames flared up.Officials said a pump attendant acted swiftly, pulling away the fuel pipe and switching off the main fuel supply.Using the fire safety kit available at the pump, the staff managed to douse the flames in time, preventing what could have been a major explosion or fire accident.During the chaos, some burning fuel reportedly splashed on the accused as well. After the incident, the duo attempted to flee but were caught by pump staff, who informed the police and lodged a complaint.Urla police later arrested both accused based on the complaint by the pump manager and CCTV footage from the site. Urla inspector Rohit Mahelkar said a case has been registered under sections related to arson and endangering public safety.Police said the quick response by petrol pump employees prevented a potentially catastrophic incident, as the fire could have spread to nearby vehicles and fuel storage areas.","A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: One of the three US-sanctioned Iran-linked oil tankers seized by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Feb 6 off the country’s coast had spent days inside Pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off, according to an FIR registered in Mumbai.The ICG had seized three ships — Asphalt Star, Stellar Ruby and Al Jafzia — around 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai for investigation and lodged a police complaint on Feb 15 at the Yellow Gate police station against nine persons, including the owner of the three ships for alleged illegal activities and smuggling oil linked to Iran. There were 55 crew members on board all three seized vessels.Based on the complaint of Aniruddha Dharampal Dabash (40), an ICG commandant, Mumbai police filed an FIR and arrested the captain of MT Asphalt Star and a crew member for their alleged role in oil smuggling and forgery. TOI has the copy of the FIR.On the ship’s presence in the Pakistan maritime zone, the FIR said, “Electronic chart display & information system data of MT Asphalt Star was examined by Coast Guard Officer assistant commandant P Siddharth Ratnam. It was observed that between Jan 20 and Jan 28, the vessel had entered Pakistan’s maritime exclusive economic zone (EEZ).”“On Jan 28, at approximately 11 hours, the vessel had switched off its automatic identification system (AIS), very high frequency (VHF) and all sensors, thereby concealing its identity and carrying out suspicious movements.Upon further questioning, the master stated that the ship’s voyage data recorder (VDR) system had stopped functioning,” it said. All three ships used AIS spoofing and false identity data to evade detection.Jogendar Singh Brar, an Indian national who is currently based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and is said to be the owner of the ships, is named as one of the accused in the FIR.Through sustained rummaging, corroboration of electronic data on board suspect vessels and verification documents and interrogation of crew, the ICG specialist boarding team established the modus operandi of criminals.“We have arrested Shyam Bahadur Chauhan and one more person in this case. They were produced before a court and sent in police custody till Feb 23,” said a police officer. Chauhan is the master of MT Asphalt Star. In the UAE, Brar claimed that his ships were providing essential supplies to other ships in distress far from the Indian coast and that the ships were not engaged in any illegal activity, say local media reports.The FIR stated that MT Asphalt Star was found to have illegally transferred 30 metric tonnes of heavy fuel oil to MT AL Jafiza in the EEZ of the Indian Ocean by conducting ship to ship operation without informing any Indian govt authorities. It was also found to have illegally transferred 5473 metric tonnes of Bitumen used for road construction to MT stellar Ruby.",One of the three US-sanctioned Iran-linked oil tankers seized by the Indian Coast Guard had spent days inside Pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off.

GANDHINAGAR: The BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules that would require couples to inform their parents before registering their union - a move welcomed by AAP, met with silence by the Congress and flagged by legal experts as a potential constitutional violation.Under the draft rules introduced in the assembly Friday, couples seeking to register their marriage will have to submit an undertaking stating whether they have informed their parents. The assistant registrar will notify the parents of both bride and groom electronically, including over WhatsApp, or through physical communication.Registration will be granted within 30 days after verification, with all submitted details uploaded to a govt portal.Deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who introduced the proposed changes, said the govt had nothing against ""love marriage"" but couldn't allow deception in the name of mutual consent. ""Innocent girls are being trapped and such practices are spreading like termites in society. Salim masquerading as Suresh will not be allowed,"" he said.Citing instances from Panchmahal district, Sanghavi said investigations were ordered after nikaah certificates were allegedly issued in villages where there was no mosque or even a single Muslim family.In villages such as Kankodakui and Nathkuva, hundreds of such certificates were allegedly issued by talati-cum-mantris (village panchayat secretaries), Sanghavi said.In the assembly, AAP legislator Hemant Ahir, who had moved a private member's bill on similar lines earlier in the week, congratulated the govt on tabling the proposed amendments. ""Changes in the rules were the need of the hour. There were several loopholes in the rules,"" he said.BJP MLA Lavingji Thakor, a strong proponent of stricter norms, said the move would benefit families of all communities. Congress stayed mum.Several community organisations, including those representing the Patidar and Kshatriya Thakor groups, have long pressed for mandatory parental involvement in love marriages. Over the past three months, as many as 30 meetings were held between the state govt and representatives of various organisations to finalise the changes.Legal experts said the proposal might not stand judicial scrutiny. ""This infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,"" said advocate Mahesh Baria. Fellow advocate Nilesh Bhavsar said while the govt had described the measure as mere intimation, parental objections could potentially influence registration decisions, leading to litigation.","BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules.

Supreme Court found this evidence weak and acquitted him of the murder charge.Finding no other evidence to link the man to the murder except that he was the last person to be seen with the child according to a neighbour and he was the one to lead the police to the victim's bones, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran acquitted him, saying the investigation was botched and left many questions unanswered. ""In the present case, the murder of a six-year-old girl went unpunished and her stepfather was incarcerated on mere conjecture,"" SC said.In the case from Chhattisgarh, what tilted the scales towards the stepfather, Rohit Jangde, was the peculiarity of the interpretation by SC in earlier judgments on the admissibility of a statement by an accused that leads to discovery of fact relating to the crime - in this case, the recovery of the girl's body.More than 65 years ago, SC had ruled that the statement of an accused leading to discovery of facts relating to the crime would be admissible evidence only when it had been made in custody.Justices Kumar and Chandran also relied on a similar interpretation used in a nearly 100-year-old ruling by Calcutta HC.Interestingly in the 1931 judgment, the then CJ of Calcutta HC had expressed anguish that the law permitted reliance on a statement made to police that led to discovery of fact only when the person was in police custody and had termed it absurd, but left it to the legislature to make suitable amends. Relying on these decades-old judgments, SC termed weak the telltale evidence incriminating Jangde.Justice Chandran said even if the evidence was accepted, it would not by itself nail the guilt on the stepfather. ""The knowledge of the accused, which led to the detection of the bone remnants though not acceptable under Section 27 would all the same be acceptable evidence under Section 8, which by itself is a weak piece of evidence. The evidence under Section 8 can only offer corroboration and cannot by itself result in a conviction,"" he said.Acquitting the accused, the bench said, ""The long gap when there was no complaint made about the missing child and the factum of none having questioned the accused, despite the family and police having been told that she went with the accused, tilts the scales in favour of the accused... Pertinent also is that since the corpus delicti was not recovered, there is no time of death specified. We are hence unable to uphold the conviction of the accused, and he has to be necessarily given the benefit of doubt. ""","A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

New Delhi: The Union home ministry on Friday constituted a second empowered committee for West Bengal to fast-track the processing of citizenship requests received under Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA).CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh belonging to their six minority faiths - Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi - who entered India before Dec 31, 2014, fearing religious persecution in their home countries.In a gazette notification issued on Friday, the home ministry said West Bengal's new empowered committee - which takes the final call on citizenship applications forwarded by the district-level committee after verification of documents - shall be headed by the deputy registrar general, directorate of census operations of the state.The original empowered committee - set up in accordance with a notification issued by MHA in March 2024 and headed by director, census operations of West Bengal - will continue to be in existence. The new empowered committee, central govt sources told TOI, has been set up as the volume of applications under CAA in the state has increased. Sharing of work is expected to compress the processing time.West Bengal has a significant number of Hindu immigrants, such as those belonging to the Matua community.BJP has been making a major outreach to them to strengthen its electoral prospects in the state.The new empowered committee on CAA allows certain members of the empowered committee as notified on March 11, 2024 - like the jurisdictional foreigners regional registration officer and state informatics officer - to nominate an officer each, not below the rank of under secretary. Other members like an officer of the subsidiary intelligence bureau and postmaster general or a postal officer nominated by him remain the same.Like the original empowered committee, the new panel shall include a representative from the office of West Bengal principal secretary (home) or additional chief secretary (home) and a representative of the jurisdictional divisional railway manager as invitees.","CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document. Our position on this particular issue was expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting joint statement,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The bureaucrat's statement broadly implies that India did not participate in drafting or agreeing to that specific joint statement condemning Israel’s West Bank expansion.Therefore, it does not reflect India’s formally agreed diplomatic position.India was among more than 100 countries and international organisations that condemned Israel's ongoing efforts to consolidate control over the West Bank in a joint statement at the UN, saying such measures violated international law and undermined the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region.India endorsed the statement late on Wednesday, just before the deadline for joint condemnation lapsed. The statement comes ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Israel next week, during which he's also likely to address the Israeli Parliament.""We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel's unlawful presence in the West Bank,"" the statement said. ""Such decisions are contrary to Israel's obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed,"" it said.It strongly opposed any form of annexation. ""We reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,"" it added.","The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting.

SRINAGAR: Operations were suspended at the 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir after it got flooded two days ago.As water entered the project’s machine room, engineers immediately halted power generation to prevent damage to critical electro-mechanical components. The project, located in Ramban district, is a major contributor to the region’s power supply. As the project’s stage 1 remains suspended, stage 2 which adds another 450 MW capacity, will be operational. It has not been impacted by the flooding, officials said.A senior official called it minor flooding which happened during scheduled maintenance. Stage 1 was anyway scheduled to remain closed for three months for repair works, the official said. “Since stage 1 has to stay shut for 90 days, we will operate stage 2 during the period,” he said.The official said stage 1 typically runs at full load for seven to eight months and at partial load for three to four months annually. Stage 2, however, operates only for about four months, from July to Sept, as per design, as there is not enough discharge to run both stages simultaneously during lean period. “Now that stage 1 is shut down for repairs, we will run stage 2, which otherwise remains closed during the lean period,” he said.","The 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir got flooded two days ago.

A week after the municipal election results were declared, an unusual post-poll drama is unfolding across several towns in Telangana. Defeated candidates are allegedly going door-to-door, asking residents to return cash and gifts they distributed during the campaign.What began as quiet requests has, in many places, escalated into heated confrontations. Some videos showing some of the defeated candidates or their relatives asking for refunds have gone viral on social media, fuelling public outrage.Reports of clashes between candidates and residents have surfaced from Medchal Malkajgiri, Khammam, Suryapet, Peddapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jagtial and Nizamabad districts. In several instances, residents said they never demanded the money or gifts given voluntarily, and it was not correct for these to be returned.On the eve of the Feb 10 polling, candidates in some municipalities and wards allegedly distributed cash between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 for each vote. Pressure cookers and sarees were allegedly given to women voters. After losing, some candidates — across party lines as well as independents — began suspecting certain colonies had not supported them.One viral clip shows a man and a woman, linked to a prominent party, carrying sarees away. When probed, the woman is heard saying if they got one vote, the opposition got four. In another video, a woman, believed to be a candidate, is seen pressuring a voter to promise that she had voted for her. After the assurance, the woman marked the voter’s name on a list.In Medchal Malkajgiri district, acandidate allegedly visited households soon after counting day, seeking repayment.

Mumbai: A tussle is brewing within the MVA over the selection of a candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat which the alliance can win in the upcoming RS polls. While Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had revealed that NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was keen on contesting, Aaditya Thackeray claimed the seat for the UBT Sena. Now the Congress has said that either one Rajya Sabha or MLC seat should come to it.""Since we have the second highest number of MLAs in the alliance, the Congress should get either a Rajya Sabha or MLC seat,"" said Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Friday.Sanjay Raut struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying three parties in the alliance will sit together and take a decision on the candidate. ""We have enough numbers for one Rajya Sabha seat. The three parties will sit down and decide who is the best candidate for the interests and identity of Maharashtra. The decision will be taken unanimously,"" Raut said. The election is slated for March 16.When asked about NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's possible candidature since his term is ending, Raut said, ""Sharad Pawar is a big leader of this country."" He added, ""Each party feels it is an important constituent and will seek opportunities.But finally, there is consensus.""Raut said it was important to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha. ""We need to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha who will raise issues in the interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.The question of a joint candidate within the MVA assumes significance in view of the speculation on talks of a merger between the NCP (SP), which is part of the MVA, and the NCP led by the late Ajit Pawar which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs.

An additional district and sessions court in Manjeri town of Kerala’s Malappuram district on Friday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for beating a 42-year-old person to death in Mankada village in a 2016 moral policing case.The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict. The court had held the five men guilty under IPC sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with dangerous weapon) and 449 (house trespass to commit an offence punishable with death).The convicts were identified as Nayakath Abdul Nassar (46), his brother Sharafudheen (39), P Suhail (40), P Abdul Ghafoor (60) and P Zakkeer Hussain (49), all natives of Koottil, near Mankada. In addition to life sentence, the two brothers and Ghafoor were awarded rigorous imprisonment of five years and 11 months and a fine of Rs 15,000 each.The other two accused, who were also found guilty of destruction of evidence, were handed additional seven years and 11 months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 20,000 each. All sentences will run concurrently. Three other accused — C Shafeeq (40), M Parambath Mansoor (40), and A Abdul Naser (41) — were acquitted due to lack of evidence.According to the prosecution, the accused forcibly broke open the door of a house where the sister-inlaw of P Zakkeer Hussain lived alone, in the early hours of June 28, 2016, alleging that the victim, Nazeer Hussain, had visited at an odd hour. The accused beat up Hussain brutally with sticks for around two hours, leaving him unconscious. The court noted the accused did not even give water to the victim, nor allowed to be taken to hospital, showing a cruel and inhuman attitude.Special public prosecutor P G Mathew said the visuals retrieved from the phones of two of the accused, who had recorded the brutal assault, turned crucial in their conviction.","The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict.

The Shiv Sena did not go with the BJP for the mayoral election.While the BJP initially announced that Chaudhary would be its mayoral candidate, it later replaced him with Sneha Patil, resulting in Chaudhary's rebellion and his joining hands with Cong-NCP (SP), who agreed to field him as the mayoral candidate of the 'secular front.' Interestingly, while the 'Bhiwandi Secular Front' secured 48 votes in the mayoral contest, with six of BJP's rebel corporators including Chaudhary voting for it, the Congress won the deputy mayor's post with 43 votes.The dispute between BJP and the Shinde Sena also worked in favour of the Congress-led front in the deputy mayor's election as the presence of three candidates worked to the Congress' advantage.",Narayan Chaudhary was elected mayor of the Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation.

""Hours after the US Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 verdict invalidating tariffs imposed by Trump, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""Hats off to the US Supreme Court for striking down President Trump’s entire tariff strategy!

What will happen to those concessions? The joint statement announced Zero tariff on many goods that the US will export to India; that India intends to import USD 500 billion worth of goods from the U.S.;that India will not buy Russian oil; that India will address the non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods, and so on,"" the former finance minister said.""What will happen to those promises?

India AI Impact Summit 2026: DGIS Harsh Chhibber Stresses Role Of Sovereign AI In Defence

Despite differences, summit has set stage for cooperation: Indian officials

New Delhi: After a week of packed halls, high-level diplomacy and billion-dollar pitches, several national delegations at the India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday, a day later than planned, as the govt works to widen global consensus on the document.The declaration, already backed by over 70 countries, comes amid companies committing to invest more than $250 billion in the country and reinforced India's push to shape global AI agenda for the Global South. Union minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday there was ""huge consensus"", with discussions continuing. ""The declaration and its contours will be shared transparently tomorrow,"" he said, adding that India hoped the final signatory count would cross 80.Countries had failed to reach a consensus at the last summit in Paris but there appears to be greater synergy on several issues, among govts and companies.Substantive disagreements also surfaced on global governance. While the UN announced formation of an independent scientific panel on AI, the US delegation warned against centralised global control of generative AI, underlining the difficulty of forging binding global rules.Despite differing views, Indian officials said the summit had laid the groundwork for collaboration rather than confrontation. ""This is about real action, not just paper,"" Vaishnaw said, pointing to bilateral discussions, industry commitments and plans for an expanded AI Mission 2.0.Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scale and diversity of participation underlined global confidence in India's approach. ""World has confidence in India's role in the new AI age. That is very important for all of us,"" he said.According to the minister, over five lakh visitors have attended the summit and the expo, with ""practically every major AI player in the world"" participating.A key highlight, Vaishnaw said, was the acceptance of PM Modi's vision of ""ManavAI"" - AI of the humans, by the humans, for the humans - which places responsible and ethical use of AI at the centre. ""For the first time, discussion on ethical and responsible AI has been brought to the forefront in such a meaningful way,"" he said.Investment commitments also featured prominently. Vaishnaw said infrastructure-related pledges linked to AI, data centres and allied technologies had already crossed $250 billion, while around $20 billion in deep-tech venture investments had been completed. ""Numbers are important, but what is more important is the trust the world has shown in India,"" he said.","India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday.

'Global South To Decide Next World Order': Stubb And Rubio Signal Shift, Echoe India's World View

New Delhi: India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI, but the real challenge now is moving beyond pilots to large-scale, trusted deployment, according to the 'Playbook for National AI Strategy and Implementation' released by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Based on work across India, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, the report argues there is no single lever to accelerate AI adoption. Countries instead need a tightly coordinated ecosystem spanning computing, funding, skills, governance and institutional accountability.Saibal Chakraborty, who leads BCG India's tech and digital advantage practice, said India already has a structural edge. ""India has solved a large part of the hard infrastructure and digital public infrastructure problem. Aadhaar, UPI and data centres make it much easier to build AI applications at scale,"" he said. The playbook cites the IndiaAI Mission's facilitation of over 38,000 GPUs, made available at under Rs 60 per hour after centralised govt negotiations with vendors.However, the report flags a financing gap. While India has more than 120 unicorns, private capital largely avoids ""socially sensitive sectors like climate, education and rural solutions"". To address this, the playbook backs govt-led fund-of-funds models for public interest AI use cases.On skills, Chakraborty said scaling artificial intelligence requires senior leadership trust and oversight. Without CEO-level confidence, AI risks remaining stuck in ""cool pilots"" despite strong national ambition","India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI.

He described ""democratic AI"" as systems that are ""open, transparent, follow the rule of law"" and function as ""a tool for an individual to scale their capabilities, to learn, think, build, create, produce."" In contrast, AI developed in ""autocratic systems"" is ""designed to enhance the central authority, the authoritarian govt,"" rather than empower individuals.Governance, he suggested, is central to the race. Citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's remark that whoever leads in AI will ""win the world,"" Lehane argued that the values embedded in AI systems will shape the global order that emerges.On oversight, he said new rules are inevitable for a general purpose technology. AI safety institutes are emerging in the US and the UK, with India exploring a similar approach.Asked whether OpenAI would support audits of its advanced systems, Lehane said the company is subject to transparency requirements under safety frameworks in US states such as California and New York and works with safety institutes in the US and UK.He drew a distinction between transparency and disclosure of proprietary information, noting concerns about protecting intellectual property. Baseline safety standards can be developed collectively, he said, but countries should retain the ability to deploy AI consistent with societal contexts. For India, the stakes are high.","The future of AI will be shaped by a contest between ""democratic AI"" and ""autocratic AI,"" OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane said.

India's talent deep enough to rival challengers: Gor

New Delhi: India formally joined Friday Pax Silica - the US flagship AI and supply chain security initiative that is widely perceived as an antidote to China's influence over critical technologies. Welcoming India, US ambassador Sergio Gor said that the coalition, which comprises some of Washington's closest allies and trusted partners as members, was about ""whether free societies would control the commanding heights of the global economy"" and would define the 21st century economic and technological order.MeitY secretary S Krishnan, US undersecretary for economic growth Jacob Helberg and Gor also signed, apart from the Pax Silica Declaration, a supplementary joint statement that said this partnership signalled a new era in which the world's oldest and largest democracies stood aligned not only in defence of liberty, but in the purposeful pursuit of prosperity and harmony for their peoples.Together, the two aspire to build an AI future that serves their citizens, strengthens their economies and societies, and refle-cts their shared values of freedom, openness, and the rule of law,"" the statement said.Gor's remarks were more revealing as he said Pax Silica was a coalition of capabilities that replaced coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases. ""India's entry into Pax Silica isn't just symbolic, it's strategic, it's essential.India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers,"" said Gor, who invited India to join the initiative that now has 11 members, on his first day in office last month.For India, Pax Silica is another significant step forward towards the normalisation of the relationship with the US after both sides finalised the framework for an interim trade agreement this month.According to Gor, India brings strength to the coalition as its engineering depth and critical mineral processing capacity offered critical capabilities to the partnership. ""Peace doesn't come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won't. Peace comes through strength. India understands this. India understands strong borders. India understands this part of the world. That strength, that sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,"" said the US ambassador, adding discussions with India were on about building supply chains that would not be held hostage.The Pax Silica Declaration seeks efforts to reduce excessive dependencies and forge new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices, while acknowledging the importance of addressing non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition.Welcoming India to ""co-found"" the future, Gor also said the initiative was about whether innovation happens in Bengaluru and Silicon Valley or in surveillance states that use technology to monitor and control their people. ""We choose freedom. We cho-ose partnership. We choose strength. And today, with India's entry into Pax Silica, we choose to win,"" said Gor.The joint statement prioritised economic security, pro-innovation regulation, stronger physical AI stack and free enterprise saying that the two sides shared the belief that a significant risk facing the free world was not advancement of AI, but the failure to lead it.Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed that cooperation under Pax Silica would further deepen engagement on critical technologies and supply chain resilience under the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.""Technology cooperation remains one of the central pillars of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

New Delhi: The increasing use of AI language models for information seeking and agentic commerce has put the existing internet business model under pressure, as these companies are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.Explaining the problem, he said that for the past decade, individuals and creators - including researchers and small businesses - have sold subscriptions or shown ads to compensate for their work. But, now AI models scrape and regurgitate information, removing direct interaction between creators and users. ""Google was a great patron, but now things have changed.""For the last 10 years, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent back one human visitor. Today, for every 30 pages, they send just one. It has become 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft performs more poorly - it sends 70 to one. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI takes 37,000 pages from the internet for every one visitor it sends back. In Anthropic's case, it's half a million pages,"" he said.Cloudflare handles almost 20% of internet traffic and works with all foundational model providers. ""The human eyeball traffic, which is the current currency of the internet, is going away. It is never going to return in the same way. We are getting more of our answers from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out a new way to compensate creators,"" he said. Prince said the world needs to figure out a new business model for the internet and develop a new rewards system beyond traffic.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince says AI models are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

New Delhi: For years, Europe watched its best AI researchers migrate to the US. India has faced the same challenge - a steady bleeding of top engineering and computer science talent to Silicon Valley. Reversing this flow is central to the global AI race, says Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of French startup Mistral AI. ""Like Europe, India was bleeding talent to the US,"" Mensch said in an interview with TOI. ""The more talent you retain and create value locally, the better.""Founded in 2023 by Mensch, Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix, Mistral AI was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big AI"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures. In just three years, the company has scaled rapidly - reaching a $400 million revenue run rate and targeting over $1 billion in revenue soon. As of last year, it was valued at $14 billion.But for Mensch, the AI race is not just commercial. It is structural - and geopolitical. With Europe heavily reliant on overseas digital infrastructure, particularly US hyperscalers, Mistral has chosen to build its own capabilities.""We don't position ourselves as a sovereign alternative. We position ourselves as a global competitor in the AI race,"" he said. ""But tactically, to have capacity you fully control, you need infrastructure - the servers that run the technology. ""About 60% of Mistral's business comes from Europe and 40% from the rest of the world. Some customers opt for its platform precisely because it can be deployed on their own infrastructure, reducing dependence on hyperscalers.Sovereign AI, he believes, is both a strategic and political necessity. As AI begins to run large parts of the global economy, govts and defence systems cannot risk external control. For businesses, over-dependence weakens negotiating leverage and continuity.India, with one of the world's largest developer pools, has a similar inflection point. ""We've brought many European researchers back to Europe. India has a unique opportunity to do the same. Universities here produce excellent AI and computer science talent. The focus should be on ensuring they innovate and build value here,"" Mensch said. Mistral is currently building commercial partnerships in India, with a local technology centre a possible next step.While rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic explore IPO paths, Mensch said a listing is ""down the road."" Profitability and global scale would be prerequisites.Mensch argues that much of enterprise AI adoption has stumbled because companies treated GenAI as a collection of tools rather than a platform shift. Early chatbot deployments focused on small productivity gains. ""That doesn't change the bottomline,"" he said. Instead, Mistral focuses on high-ROI use cases that address major sources of business friction.At the core of its strategy is open source. ""If you have access to model parameters, you can deploy wherever you want - including local infrastructure,"" Mensch said. Open models also allow customisation. ""Running a business should not mean over-dependence on a single service provider. I've said it multiple times - Europe cannot become an AI colony of the US.""","'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at AI Impact Summit.

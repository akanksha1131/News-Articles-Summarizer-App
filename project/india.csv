"Big cat, big loss: In 4 years, Maharashtra has lost 142 tigers, 537 leopards, reveals RTI query",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-cat-big-loss-in-4-years-maharashtra-has-lost-142-tigers-537-leopards-reveals-rti-query/articleshow/124710563.cms,"NAGPUR: In a worrying trend, accidents, poaching, and electrocution accounted for a significant number of 142 tiger and 537 leopard deaths reported in Maharashtra from Jan 2022 to Sept 2025. The big cat fatality data was provided by the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Nagpur, in response to a Right to Information (RTI) query.The report states that 35 tigers and 115 leopards have died in Maharashtra this year till Sept. In comparison, 26 tiger deaths were reported in 2024, 52 in 2023, and 29 in 2022. Among this year’s tiger deaths, 21 were due to natural causes, five from accidents, another five linked to electrocution and poaching, and four due to unspecified reasons.Of the 142 tiger fatalities reported since 2022, natural deaths accounted for 84 cases, while 23 were killed in accidents and 29 fell to poaching. In six cases, the cause of death remained unclear. Experts say poachers commonly use electrocution and traps in forest fringes.“Poachers target big cats mainly for their body parts and claws, which have high value in the black market. They are also killed to prevent attacks on livestock,” said a wildlife crime analyst.Leopard deaths, which stood at 115 so far in 2025, included 44 from natural causes, 42 from accidents, two from hunting, three from electrocution, and 21 from other causes. In the past, the state had recorded 144 leopard deaths in 2024, 138 in 2023, and 140 in 2022.The data was issued in response to a RTI filed by Abhay Kolarkar.The data confirms that Maharashtra’s tiger population stands at 444, as per ‘Status of Tigers in India 2022’ report published by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. Officials said most natural deaths are linked to intra-species conflicts, old age, and diseases, while accidental deaths involve vehicle hits and electrocution near forest fringes. Experts also attributed the high accident rate to highways and railway lines passing through wildlife corridors.","35 tigers and 115 leopards have died in Maharashtra this year till Sept.

"Even slight penetration is rape, consent irrelevant for minors: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/even-slight-penetration-is-rape-consent-irrelevant-for-minors-hc/articleshow/124710553.cms,"CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently ruled that even the slightest penetration constitutes rape and that consent is irrelevant when the survivor is a minor, reaffirming the absolute nature of protection under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.Dismissing the appeal of a 38-year-old driver from Hinganghat in Wardha district, the court upheld his conviction and 10-year sentence for attempting to commit aggravated penetrative sexual assault on two girls aged five and six. Justice Nivedita Mehta, who authored the judgment, held that ‘the act of rape or aggravated penetrative sexual assault stands complete as soon as the accused inserts any body part into the survivor’s private parts — the extent of penetration being immaterial in law’.The court found that the accused lured the children with guavas, showed them obscene videos, and attempted to assault them sexually. He was convicted under section 6 of the Pocso Act and section 376(2)(i) read with Section 511 of the IPC and fined Rs50,000.Justice Mehta observed that the prosecution “proved its foundational facts beyond a reasonable doubt,” relying on consistent and credible testimonies of the survivors and their mother, supported by medical and forensic evidence.“Simply because, in the medical examination conducted on the survivor after more than 15 days, no injuries were found on her private parts due to her tender age, the alleged act committed by the accused cannot be termed as an ‘attempt’ to discard the otherwise reliable and trustworthy testimony,” she said.The bench rejected the petitioner’s claim of false implication over alleged family enmity, noting the absence of any corroborative evidence. It also accepted the delay in filing the FIR, stating it was reasonable given the survivors’ young age and the threats issued by the accused.The HC further corrected the trial court’s misapplication of the amended Pocso sentencing provisions introduced in August 2019 — five years after the crime, which occurred on Feb 19, 2014. Justice Mehta clarified that punishment must be governed by the law prevailing at the time of the offence. “The trial court’s reliance on the amended provision of section 6, prescribing a minimum sentence of 20 years, as well as its invocation of section 18 of the Pocso Act for the purpose of calculating sentence, is legally erroneous,” she stated. However, the bench affirmed that the 10-year rigorous imprisonment imposed was consistent with the minimum punishment prescribed by the unamended statute and required no modification.","Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently ruled that even the slightest penetration constitutes rape.

"Bihar Assembly polls: Opposition allies climb down, yet face friendly fights in state",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-opposition-allies-climb-down-yet-face-friendly-fights-in-state/articleshow/124710181.cms,"Bihar Polls: RJD Announces Candidate List for Bihar Elections, 143 Contenders

Poll Do you think the political situation in Bihar will improve before the elections? Yes, there's potential for improvement No, it will likely worsen

Dissent rules, both in INDIA bloc and NDA



PATNA: Just a fortnight before the first phase of polling in Bihar, partners in the INDIA bloc, which seemed to be in a disarray till Sunday, appeared going into the damage-control mode on Monday with some withdrawing candidates against each other on certain seats. RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies. It dropped 31 MLAs and nominated new candidates. Congress has fielded candidates for 61 seats, while the Left comprising the CPI-ML, CPI and CPM announced its list of 30. On the other hand, the VIP led by former minister Mukesh Sahani has come up with its list of 15 candidates, which means the INDIA bloc partners still have some friendly contests on at least six seats.Opposition bloc leaders said they were hoping the clouds of uncertainty would clear by Oct 23, the last date of withdrawal of candidature for the second phase.Significantly, JMM withdrew from the Bihar contest after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc. “Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s ‘political’ immaturity. Congress should have mediated to accommodate JMM, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar.There was consensus in INDIA bloc over the CM face till Monday night. Despite RJD being the largest bloc with 143 seats to its share, Congress has so far refrained from announcing Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face although he is the coordination committee chairman. Also, INDIA bloc members have not come together in a show of unity for a long time and have been speaking through the media only, adding to confusion in the opposition bloc.In seat-sharing, things looked moving in some direction when RJD didn’t announce its candidate from Kutumba seat against Congress candidate and party’s state chief Rajesh Kumar. RJD had earlier announced it would field its candidate from this seat after the conflict intensified between the two partners, in alliance for the past 35 years.On the other hand, Congress candidate Aditya Kumar withdrew his nomination from Lalganj seat on Monday, in a relief to RJD nominee. RJD had fielded Shivani Shukla, daughter of jailed strongman Munna Shukla, from this seat.In another development, VIP candidate Sakaldeo Bind withdrew his candidature from Tarapur seat in favour of RJD candidate. A visibly annoyed Bind soon resigned from the party and lent his support to BJP candidate and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, a VIP spokesperson said.“Things are moving in the right direction and the situation will be more clear by Oct 23, the last date for withdrawal of candidature,” Congress legislature party leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan said on Monday. However, another bloc partner CPI haven’t withdrawn candidates against Congress in three seats.Initially, JMM announced to go solo after seat talks failed but suddenly on Monday urban development minister Sudivya Kumar said, “JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls.” Kumar said, “Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.Purnia MP Pappu Yadav, who earlier merged his party with Congress, asked the latter to break alliance with RJD on Monday, blaming the latter for not following “coalition dharma”.Things don’t look good in the rival NDA as well as former Union minister and BJP leader Raj Kumar Singh launched sharp attacks on his party for giving tickets to persons with criminal antecedents. He appealed to the people not to vote for opposition candidates such as Osama Shahab, son of RJD politician late Mohammad Anant Singh and RJD candidate from Mokama Veena Devi.","RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies.

Pune farmer receives only Rs 664 for 7.5 quintals of rain-damaged onions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pune-farmer-receives-low-onion-prices-as-rain-and-poor-policies-hurt-maharashtra-agriculture/articleshow/124709996.cms,"Onions rot, markets stagnate



'Better to destroy crops than sell'



'The day farmers get fair prices, crime will come down'



Produce from other states, stock coming to market



Poor govt policies blamed



Soyabean, old stock of toor, chana also hit



PUNE: Sudam Ingle, a farmer from Purandar, spent around Rs 66,000 on his onion crop this season. The incessant rains damaged most of his yield, but he managed to salvage a portion and spent another Rs 1,500 to pack and transport it to the Purandar market yard for sale on Friday. To his shock, Ingle received just Rs 664 for 7.5 quintals of onions.“This was from one acre of land. I still have onions from another 1.5 acres, but I won’t sell them; I’ll run a rotor and turn them into fertiliser for next year. That’s more profitable than selling,” he said. “I’m still a relatively big farmer. I don’t know how smaller farmers with just one or two acres, many of whom have taken loans, will survive. If the govt doesn’t step in, farmer suicides will increase.”Ingle’s story is echoed across Maharashtra’s farmlands, where relentless rains and collapsing prices have left farmers struggling to survive. From onions, tomatoes, potatoes to pomegranates, custard apples, to soyabean, almost every crop has taken a hit this season.With no money in hand, farmers have no purchasing power, directly affecting rural markets that flourish during Diwali. “This year, Diwali is being celebrated only in cities.In villages, there’s no money to buy even a diya,” said an APMC member from Nashik.In Lasalgaon APMC, Asia’s largest onion market, prices range from Rs 500 to Rs 1,400 per quintal, with the average stable at Rs 1,050 (Rs 10.50/kg) for the past week before it closed for Diwali. An APMC member said, “This summer (March–April), we saw a bumper onion crop. The shelf life is around seven months, so many farmers who didn’t sell then, hoping for higher prices, stored it and are selling now. The new crops faced the wrath of rains as 80% of the onion crop in the Nashik region is damaged. Even the salvaged stock is of poor quality and selling for very low prices.”Ingle said farmers spend heavily right from preparing fields, buying saplings, sowing, spraying pesticides, watering, weeding, harvesting, packing, and transporting the crop to market. “My 393 kg of onion was sold at Rs 3 per kg, 202 kg at Rs 2 per kg, and 146 kg at Rs 10 per kg, depending on the damage. Loading, unloading, weighing, and transport cost Rs 1,065. So the net amount I got after deducting that from Rs 1,729 was Rs 664,” said Ingle flatly, adding, “Being a farmer means a life of struggles. ”Manikrao Zende, who farms custard apple, pomegranate, and onions in Purandar, incurred significant losses this year. “Looking at the market rate, I ran a rotor through my onion crop which will at least help fertilise the field because selling it will increase my losses. I invested Rs 1.5 lakh in the pomegranate farm this year, but due to non-stop rains, the plants turned black, forcing me to discard them. The same happened with the 500 custard apple saplings I planted. It cost me around Rs 1 lakh, but the rains ruined them, and I had to sell them for Rs 50,000,” said Zende.Zende blamed the govt for ignoring the plight of farmers, alleging that the administration is yet to conduct a panchnama of his fields despite the destruction caused by rains. He also linked the rise in crime across the state to the growing distress in farming. “When farmer families do not have money, their children have no work. Some migrate to cities, but some stay back. The youth has no money, no job, and criminal elements easily attract this crowd. This is why we have such a surge in criminal activity among the youth. The day farmers get work and a fair price for their produce, crime will come down,” he said.The average price of tomatoes in the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC stands at Rs 1,100 per crate (20 kg). Manik Gore, a commissioning agent at the Chakan APMC and a farmer himself, said that while he usually skips the May–October season, this year he sowed soyabean on one acre of land. But nothing survived the rains. “My input cost was Rs 20,000, completely gone. The onion coming to market is spoiled due to rain. If a farmer brings 50 kg, only 10 kg or less gets a decent price, and the rest is sold at Rs 2–3 per kg. Onion and potatoes from other states like UP and Gujarat are flooding the markets. Good-quality potatoes sell at Rs 10–15 per kg, but the input cost per acre is around Rs 40,000. Considering that, whatever we are getting now is nothing. Farmers around Pune are still better off, but 80–100 km away, their situation is heartbreaking,” said Gore.Gore said poor govt policies have worsened the onion crisis. “Onion was getting good prices, but India banned exports in 2023. Other countries swooped in on our market share, and when the ban was finally lifted, we lost our clients in the international market. If the govt can ban exports when prices rise, should they not buy onions at a good price when the market crashes? That never happens. Farming means a life of suffering,” he said.According to Ramesh Suryavanshi, a trader at Latur APMC for soyabean, one of the biggest in India, 50% of the soyabean crop in the region was damaged due to rains. “The average price of good soyabean (12-2-2 which means maximum 12% moisture, 2% impurities (foreign matter), and 2% damaged kernels) is between Rs 4,100 to Rs 4,250. But the ones destroyed by moisture are selling for as low as Rs 2,000- Rs 3,000 per quintal which doesn’t even cover half of the input cost in growing the crop,” said Suryavanshi adding that farmers are hoping procurement centres will open soon.Even the farmers and traders who kept the old stock in hopes to sell it when the markets improve are forced to sell at low prices. “The rates for soyabean have not improved for two years now and even the rates of chana and toor dal are poor. Good quality chana is being sold at Rs 5,400-Rs 5,500 but the damaged ones are selling at Rs 3,000. Same with toor dal which is selling maximum at Rs 6,800. Farmers can’t even buy the bare minimum for Diwali. And because farmers lost their purchasing power, other Diwali businesses are also affected. The overall situation is gloomy,” said Suryavanshi.","Rains and collapsing prices have left farmers struggling to survive.

India records extreme rainfall during southwest monsoon 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-records-extreme-rainfall-during-southwest-monsoon-2025/articleshow/124709544.cms,"KOCHI: Nearly half of India witnessed extreme rainfall during southwest monsoon of 2025. According to a report by Climate Trends released on Friday, 45% of India’s landmass experienced extreme rainfall during this season.In the last 10 years, from 2016 to 2025, five years registered above-normal rainfall, two years recorded normal rainfall and three years witnessed below-normal rainfall in the country. It stated that southwest monsoon of 2025 recently concluded with ‘above-normal’ rainfall, amounting to 108% of the long-period average (LPA). This is the second consecutive year in last decade to record above-normal rains.West Coast has the second biggest contribution to the total monsoon rainfall. While Konkan and Goa made a significant contribution, top performer Kerala reported normal rainfall but, on the negative side, with a deficit of -13%. State recorded 1,752.8mm of rainfall during the four months against the normal of 2,018.6mm.Wayanad, which was affected by landslides last year, reported the highest rainfall deficiency of -36%, followed by Idukki at -35% and Malappuram at -27%.Increased sea surface temperature in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal led to greater moisture loading or higher evaporation, making rainfall events extreme.“Monsoon seasons are not the same anymore. The last 10 years recorded normal to above-normal rainfall, with the latter being more prominent. Monsoon amplification and intensification are directly linked to global warming. Global warming became the biggest driver of monsoon now. The influence of El Niño and La Niña has been decreasing in the global warming era. The number of rainy days has decreased, but the quantum of rainfall has increased. The daily quantum of rainfall underwent a significant change,” said K J Ramesh, former director general, IMD “Behavioural patterns of monsoon systems have changed drastically, altering rainfall patterns as well. We now see low-pressure areas spending more days than their average period over the land, maintaining their strength. This is mainly because of increased and continuous moisture feed over the land. Not only have extreme rainfall events increased, but there has also been a rise in cloudburst-like conditions. This was not the case earlier,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather.","45% of India’s landmass experienced extreme rainfall during this season.

Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India responsible?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

DURGAPUR/KOLKATA: Two accused in the Durgapur gang-rape case, Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq, moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.Police officers involved in the probe said if the court accepts the plea, the two may be treated as approvers during the trial.The complainant, a 23-year-old MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur, was allegedly gangraped shortly after she had stepped out of the campus with a classmate on Oct 10 evening for dinner.Riyazuddin, Safiq and four other men, including the classmate, Wasef Ali, are in custody.The court on Sunday sent Riyazuddin and Safiq, who had been in police remand since their arrest, to jail custody for two days so they could think over their plea for confession. The court will pass an order on Oct 21.The appeal was filed under Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, which spells out the procedure for a judicial magistrate to record confessions related to an ongoing criminal investigation.Riyazuddin worked as a guard at the medical college where the survivor studied till he was sacked five years ago for indiscipline. Safiq worked at a local factory.In a detailed statement to police and a magistrate, the survivor said one man pinned her to the ground and raped her in a desolate forested spot, while two others watched. Two other men, who police later identified as Riyazuddin and Safiq, arrived at the spot later.But instead of helping her, they called the rapists to the spot and the five demanded Rs 3,000 from the student. They took Rs 200 that the survivor was carrying and also snatched her cellphone.The other three accused are Nasiruddin Sk, Apu Bauri and Firdaus Sk. The survivor has mentioned in the complaint that classmate Wasef Ali molested her and fled when she was struggling to fight off the attackers.The maximum punishment for gang rape is 20 years in jail and for extortion, seven years in jail.Partha Ghosh, the lawyer representing the survivor, said, “We have filed an appeal that a test identification parade be done quickly.”","Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. (AI image)

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

Poll What do you think is the most significant advantage of the BrahMos missile system? Extended strike range and precision Faster deployment and versatility

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

Alliance unity under question



NEW DELHI: Tejashwi Yadav ’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Bihar assembly's single-largest party and the main opposition force, marked Diwali on Monday by announcing its list of 143 candidates. The move asserts RJD’s dominant position within the Mahagathbandhan even as tensions simmer among allies.Led by Tejashwi, the party aims to unseat chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has anti-incumbency as a negative factor after years in power. For RJD, long led by Lalu Prasad Yadav, this election is crucial, a battle that could define Tejashwi’s political future.The announcement came on the last day of nominations for the second phase, confirming that RJD will contest 143 seats, Congress 61, CPI(ML) 20, and the remaining few likely going to Mukesh Sahani’s VIP.RJD scion Tejashwi will contest again from Raghopur, while several key names feature in the list, including Renu Kushwaha from Bihariganj, Anita Devi Mahto from Warsaliganj, and Mala Pushpam from Hasanpur. Other candidates include Sandhya Rani Kushwaha from Madhuban, Ritu Priya Chaudhary from Imamganj (SC), Tanushree Manjhi from Barachatti (SC), and Chandni Devi Singh from Baniapur.In a sign of strain within the alliance, RJD and Congress have fielded rival candidates in several constituencies.In Narkatiaganj, Deepak Yadav (RJD) faces Shaswat Kedar Pandey (Congress); in Kahalgaon, Rajnish Bharti (RJD) goes up against Praveen Singh Kushwaha (Congress); and in Sikandra (SC), Uday Narayan Chaudhary (RJD) faces Vinod Chaudhary (Congress).Another constituent of the alliance, CPI too faces Congress in Bachhwara, Rajapakar, Rosera, and Biharsharif, while RJD is directly up against Congress in Vaishali, Warisaliganj, Lalganj, and Kahalgaon.RJD’s list clearly reflects its focus on the traditional Muslim-Yadav (MY) equation, with over 50 tickets allotted to these communities. Of the total 143 candidates, 23 are women, marking an effort to broaden the party’s appeal.The party also handed a ticket to the late gangster-politician and former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin’s son from Siwan’s Raghunathpur, reinforcing ties to its old base.A key highlight is the battle for Mahua, where RJD’s Mukesh Raushan will face Tej Pratap Yadav, Lalu’s elder son, who was expelled from the party earlier this year. Tej Pratap has since launched his own party, Janshakti Janata Dal, and announced himself as candidate from Mahua, an RJD stronghold. The family feud adds personal drama to the already tense political equation.Several incumbents and loyalists have retained their seats. A Yadav continues from Sonepur in Saran district, Lalu’s home turf, while Bhai Virendra from Maner and Ritlal Rai from Danapur also feature on the list. Both seats fall within the Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency, represented by Misa Bharti, Lalu’s daughter, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Despite releasing its list, the Mahagathbandhan has yet to formally announce a chief ministerial candidate. While Tejashwi’s leadership is widely recognised, Rahul Gandhi’s avoidance of naming him as the CM face at a joint rally has fuelled speculation of unease within the alliance.The overlapping seats and leadership ambiguity could end up benefiting the ruling NDA.Bihar, India’s fourth-largest assembly, will go to polls in two phases -- November 6 and November 11 -- with counting on November 14.","Tejashwi Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal announces its list of 143 candidates.

'You Gave Sleepless Nights To Pak': PM Modi Hails INS Vikrant and BrahMos Role in Operation Sindoor

What PM Modi said

""Today is an amazing day. This scene is memorable. Today, on one side, I have the ocean, and on the other, I have the strength of the brave soldiers of Mother India.""

""Being close to you, feeling your breath, sensing your heartbeat, and seeing the sparkle in your eyes, I realised something profound. I slept a little early yesterday, which I normally don’t do. The reason I slept early was that after observing you all day, the sense of fulfilment I felt inside was not my own sleep, but the sleep of contentment""

""It is my privilege to celebrate this sacred festival of Diwali among all you brave warriors of the Indian Navy. The night I spent yesterday on INS Vikrant is beyond words to describe.I saw the enthusiasm and joy on your faces. The way you portrayed Operation Sindoor through your songs was truly moving.""

""I extend my heartfelt Diwali greetings to the families of all you brave soldiers.Everyone wishes to celebrate Diwali with their family. I too have grown accustomed to spending this festival with my loved ones.That is why I have come among you — because you are my family. So that I too can celebrate Diwali with my own.And that is what makes this Diwali truly special for me.""

""The deep night over the sea and the sunrise that followed have made this Diwali truly special for me in many ways. Therefore, I once again extend my warm Diwali wishes to all of you. And from the valiant deck of INS Vikrant, I convey heartfelt Diwali greetings to every citizen of our nation.""

""The extraordinary coordination between our three services brought Pakistan to its knees in record time.""

""The Indian Navy is like the guardian of the Indian Ocean.""

""I was observing the strength of the military equipment. These large ships, aircraft that move faster than the wind, these submarines, they are impressive in themselves, but what makes them truly formidable is the courage of those who operate them. These ships may be made of iron, but when you board them, they become living, breathing forces of the armed services. I have been with you since yesterday. In every moment, I have learned something. When I left Delhi, I thought I would live this moment myself. But your hard work, penance and dedication are on such a high level that I could not truly live it. I did, however, gain an understanding of it. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to truly live this life.""

""Just a few months ago, we witnessed how the very name Vikrant sent waves of fear across Pakistan.Such is its might — a name that shatters the enemy’s courage even before the battle begins. This is the power of INS Vikrant.""

""The fear generated by the Indian Navy, the extraordinary skill displayed by the Indian Air Force , the bravery of the Indian Army, and the tremendous coordination among the three forces compelled Pakistan to surrender so quickly during Operation Sindoor.

PATNA: The INDIA bloc continues to grapple with mounting internal friction, which is beginning to derail its election campaign in Bihar as the filing of nomination papers for the second and final phase of closes on Monday. Some seats have witnessed INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other and none of them withdrew their nominations even on Sunday. Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute, sending a worrying signal to voters.In contrast, the NDA campaign is in full swing. Union minister Amit Shah has returned to Delhi after a three-day tour while union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is currently camping in Bihar. The chief ministers of Goa, Haryana and Tripura have addressed rallies in various parts of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.“The INDIA bloc leaders need to sit together and tell the people that ‘we are united’ and there is no conflict among us,” Congress MP from Katihar Tariq Anwar told TOI on Sunday, acknowledging the impact of the internal discord.“But we hope everything will be over by Monday, the last date for filing nominations for the second phase. There must not be any scope for a friendly fight,” he added.Despite the mounting tension, top INDIA bloc leaders have been largely absent from the campaign trail. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, perceived as the opposition’s CM face, remains in Patna, chalking out strategy at home, while there is no clarity on the campaign plans of Congress leaders such as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi.However, state RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan sought to downplay the concerns. “Tejashwi will embark on a poll campaign after Diwali. Every party in the INDIA bloc wants him to campaign for their candidates. Although Tejashwi has filed his nominations from the Raghopur seat, he is, in fact, contesting elections on all 243 seats of Bihar,” Gagan said.Meanwhile, denial of tickets has triggered dramatic protests across the state. Candidates have been seen rolling on the ground, tearing their kurtas, crying bitterly before the camera and threatening to teach lessons to official nominees. The chaos comes just a fortnight before the first phase of polling on Nov 6.In Patna, RJD leader Madan Shah, seeking a ticket from the Madhuban seat, broke down outside the 10,Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi, tearing his kurta in despair. “Lalu ji promised a ticket from the Madhuban seat, but it was given to someone else. I will die… Can’t bear the pain,” he shouted.Another aspirant, Usha Devi, cried bitterly before the reporters outside Rabri’s residence. “I have been associated with the RJD for the past 20 years and have been the torchbearer of the party in the region, but the ticket went to someone else… This is heart-breaking, but I will still campaign for the RJD,” she said, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad as a “father figure.”In Gopalganj, former RJD legislator Reyazul Haq Raju broke down during a live online session, expressing anguish over not receiving a party ticket while three-time Congress legislator from Kasba in Purnia district, Afaque Alam, accused party leaders of demanding money in exchange for tickets.“The state unit of Congress has now become hostage in the hands of ‘personal brokers of some leaders’.

The agency had attached Royal Rajvilas after the project got entangled in multiple cases of fraud, cheating and money laundering. ED later approached Rajasthan HC, and subsequently, the apex court seeking to withdraw its attachment partially and restore the properties to the fraud victims.“We place on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the learned counsels for parties and ED in restoring the attached properties to secure the interests of genuine and innocent homebuyers,” an SC bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe said.ED verified the details of 221 homebuyers and submitted ‘no objection’ in restitution of the properties to homebuyers, except in case of eight, which were marked as beneficiaries of “proceeds of crime”.The restitution will help the 213 homebuyers who had been in throes of anxiety because of protracted litigation of over seven years between the successful resolution applicant Udaipur Entertainment World Pvt Ltd and ED. SC has, however, clarified that it has passed the order on the peculiar facts of the case without going into the merits, and so it shall not be treated as a precedent and questions of law shall remain open to be decided in an appropriate case.","SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers.

Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM): Kushwaha banks on OBC base

Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP): Sahni eyes bigger role

CPI(ML): Left’s moral and electoral muscle

NEW DELHI: As Bihar heads to assembly elections on November 6 and 11, regional allies within both the National Democratic Alliance and the Mahagathbandhan are preparing to play decisive roles. While the BJP and JD(U) remain the dominant forces, smaller allies such as Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), and Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) hold critical caste-based support bases that could influence close contests. On the other side, the Left parties, particularly the CPI(ML), are positioning themselves as a powerful voice within the opposition alliance.The state’s political landscape remains shaped by caste equations and coalition dynamics. The NDA’s seat-sharing deal saw BJP and JD(U) receive 101 seats each, while LJP (Ram Vilas) got 29, and both HAM(S) and RLM six each. Yet, murmurs of discontent have emerged, particularly within HAM, where leaders feel “undervalued.” Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan’s internal seat talks with the Left remain unresolved.For all four smaller parties, these elections are about survival, recognition, and bargaining power.Whether within the ruling alliance or the opposition bloc, each carries the weight of distinct caste identities and regional loyalties — crucial ingredients in Bihar’s complex political arithmetic.Former chief minister and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi continues to wield quiet influence in Bihar’s NDA. The 81-year-old leader, representing the Gaya Lok Sabha seat, commands significant support among Mahadalits, particularly the Musahar community. HAM has been allotted six seats under the NDA’s seat-sharing formula, though Manjhi had demanded 15.“It is true that we have secured fewer seats, the morale of our workers is weakened, and there is deep dissatisfaction among the workers,” Manjhi said on X. However, he added that “for the pride and honour of Biharis… the NDA will triumph, and Bihar’s honour will endure.”HAM has fielded Manjhi’s daughter-in-law Deepa Kumari from Imamganj and her mother Jyoti Devi from Barachatti, drawing criticism over dynastic politics. The party defended the move, noting both women were sitting MLAs with proven records. Despite limited seats, HAM’s Dalit outreach in Magadh — where it dominates six assembly segments — could prove crucial for the NDA in a tight race.Former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha’s RLM, another NDA ally with six seats, is counting on support from the non-Yadav OBC community, particularly the Kushwahas. In 2020, the party was part of the Mahagathbandhan but has since returned to the NDA fold.“The issue of seat allocation among NDA parties has been resolved through amicable discussions,” Kushwaha said, echoing the coalition’s unified message. His wife, Snehlata, has been fielded from Sasaram — a decision defended by party spokesperson Ram Pukar Sinha as “reflective of the people’s support for her candidature.”Despite losing the 2024 Lok Sabha election from Karakat — a setback blamed on BJP rebel Pawan Singh’s independent bid — Kushwaha remains a key player among Bihar’s non-Yadav OBCs, a group the NDA is keen to consolidate.Mukesh Sahni, founder of the VIP and self-styled “Son of Mallah,” has fielded 11 candidates this time, mainly across Mithilanchal, seeking to revive his fortunes after a turbulent 2020. His party, targeting the state’s large Extremely Backward Class (EBC) vote bank, won three seats in 2020 but saw all its MLAs later defect to the BJP.This time, Sahni has declared his ambition to become deputy chief minister if the NDA returns to power. The EBC bloc, Bihar’s most populous, remains a crucial target group for both major alliances. Mithilanchal — where the BJP and JD(U) swept all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2024 — will again be a key battleground, and VIP’s performance could influence the Mahagathbandhan's final tally.On the opposition side, the CPI(ML)-Liberation continues to assert itself within the Mahagathbandhan, demanding a greater seat share after its stellar 2020 showing. The Left bloc won 16 of 29 seats it contested in 2020, with CPI(ML) alone securing 12 of 19 — a 63% strike rate.“We have maintained the spirit of coalition. Although we deserved more seats this time, we finally decided to contest only 20 assembly segments,” said CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya. CPI leader D Raja added, “Our party has a great history in Bihar and widespread presence… we should get reasonable number of seats.”As alliances settle their equations and campaigns intensify, these four smaller parties — HAM, RLM, VIP, and CPI(ML) — could once again emerge as decisive forces in a state where even a few thousand votes can determine who rules Patna.","Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) holds critical caste-based support bases that could influence close contests.

Rs 2,500 per month

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a woman in Bihar, in possession of her vote, must be courted with the utmost care — especially when elections are near. Both the ruling coalition NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have recognized this fact with admirable zeal, offering pensions, bank transfers, honoraria, and schemes.The NDA’s pre-poll push has leaned heavily on the DBT model, taking cues from other states to ensure direct, timely transfers. From the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, which deposited Rs 10,000 each into the accounts of 75 lakh women, to nearly tripling pensions for widows, the elderly, and the disabled, the government has sought to combine social welfare with political messaging.The Mahagathbandhan, meanwhile, has countered with its own promises, including Rs 2,500 per month for women under the “Mai Behan Maan” scheme and 200 units of free electricity for households. While the NDA’s measures have already begun reaching beneficiaries, the opposition pledges are positioned as corrective steps to perceived gaps in the current administration’s welfare framework.Against this backdrop, the question arises: will these schemes genuinely sway women voters, or will they be seen as another round of political maneuvering in the lead-up to the elections?Taking lessons from Maharashtra’s “Ladki Bahin Yojana” and Haryana’s “Lado Laxmi Yojana”, Bihar followed the DBT playbook to woo women voters.Just months ahead of assembly elections, Nitish Kumar-led government rolled ""Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana"". With Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressing the button from Delhi, Rs 10,000 each went straight into the bank accounts of 75 lakh women across Bihar.The Rs 7,500-crore scheme was pitched as a push for women’s empowerment through self-employment and livelihood generation, though its timing carried a clear political pulse.Taking the social security route, Nitish Kumar nearly tripled pensions for widows, the elderly, and the disabled. Monthly allowances rose from Rs 400 to Rs 1,100, benefiting over 1.9 crore people.The enhanced amounts were credited directly to beneficiaries’ bank accounts by the 10th of each month.Asha workers saw their honorarium jump from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000, while Mamta workers’ incentives doubled to Rs 600 per delivery. The government framed it as recognition for their key role in boosting rural healthcare, but the timing ahead of assembly elections gave it an unmistakable political undertone.The move is expected to have benefited 95,000 Asha workers and 4,600 Mamta workers.In yet another women-centric push ahead of elections, Prime Minister Modi launched the “Jeevika Nidhi” financial scheme for rural women entrepreneurs in Bihar. The initiative aimed to ease access to credit for women associated with the state’sself-help groups. As part of the launch, Rs 105 crore was transferred to the institution’s account, with PM Modi calling the move an “auspicious start” and crediting women’s empowerment as a key pillar of India’s development.Under the scheme, all cluster-level federations underbecame members of a new cooperative society jointly funded by the Centre and the state. The system functioned entirely online to ensure faster, more transparent transfers directly into women’s bank accounts.The Mahagathbandhan promised that women from deprived sections in Bihar would receive Rs 2,500 per month under the “Mai Behan Maan” scheme if the alliance formed the next government. The proposed initiative aimed to provide direct financial support to women and ensure timely transfers through streamlined registration.The alliance also pledged to strengthen social security for women, presenting the scheme as a step toward both economic empowerment and political inclusion, contrasting it with the current administration’s lower and irregular payouts.The Mahagathbandhan promised to provide 200 units of free electricity to consumers if it forms the next government in Bihar. The initiative was presented as a measure to ease household expenses and attract voter support ahead of the assembly elections.However, months later, the Bihar government announced free electricity for up to 125 units for domestic consumers.","Both the ruling coalition NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have offered pensions, bank transfers, honoraria, and schemes.

2020 fallout: When Chirag went solo





Nitish’s declining arc





What's at stake?





NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing deal for the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly election revealed a subtle but significant shift in internal power dynamics within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). For the first time since the early 1990s, the two principal partners — the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar , and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — will contest 101 seats each in Bihar’s 243-seat assembly, while the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) (LJP(RV)), led by Chirag Paswan, got 29 seats.For the first time, the BJP has secured equal seat-sharing in Bihar, ending the long-standing tradition of Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) playing the “big brother.” This parity between BJP and JD(U) underscores how BJP has shifted from the “junior” to an equal (or perhaps dominant) status in Bihar’s ruling coalition — while continuing to present Nitish as the face of stability.Meanwhile, LJP(RV)’s allocation of 29 seats — though modest in absolute terms — is significantly larger than typical junior-ally shares and includes visibility-rich constituencies: for example, in districts such as Jamui, Hajipur and Khagaria, where Dalit and youth demographics are strong.The logic seems clear: BJP is hedging its bet—maintaining Nitish for his experience and stability, while elevating Chirag as a long-term ally and potentially a future power centre.The backdrop to this shifting balance lies in the 2020 assembly election. In that election, JD(U) won just 43 seats, down from 71 in 2015 elections. Meanwhile, LJP fielded candidates on its own and acted as a vote-splitter. The result of this vote-cutting was a massive drop in the JD(U)'s seat tally, which fell from 71 seats in 2015 to just 43 seats in 2020.This was the JD(U)'s lowest tally in years and resulted in the party becoming the junior partner to the BJP for the first time in the NDA coalition in Bihar.As Chirag famously declared in October 2020, “I am Prime Minister Modi’s Hanuman… the PM lives in my heart.” His solo campaign was widely seen as an effort to weaken JD(U) while maintaining warmth toward the BJP.Nitish, for his part, responded with restraint. He welcomed the NDA’s overall victory but could not overlook how his party’s reduced tally had shifted the internal arithmetic — paving the way for BJP’s greater influence in coalition decisions.Nitish Kumar’s political journey has been defined by his reputation as “Sushasan Babu” — the administrator who once dominated Bihar’s politics. But by 2020, JD(U)’s footprint had shrunk and its strike rate fell sharply.Now, in 2025, BJP appears to be pursuing a dual strategy: keep Nitish visible as the stabiliser and face of continuity, while also nurturing Chirag as a parallel power centre. For BJP, that solves two problems at once: one, it retains the organisational strength and governance credentials associated with Nitish; two, it prepares for a future in which the LJP’s Dalit-youth base and rising profile may become more central.For Nitish, the 2025 election is not just about retaining power—it’s about preserving relevance. If JD(U) fails to hold ground, Nitish may become a symbolic leader within his own alliance rather than its fulcrum.For Chirag, the 29-seat allocation marks his political breakthrough. He revealed that his party chose from a “pool of 38 seats” offered by BJP, stressing “quality over quantity.” His negotiation skills were on full display during the seat-sharing talks: engaging in multiple rounds with senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, he held firm until securing favourable terms. As a result, LJP(RV) emerged as the largest junior ally in the NDA. While BJP and JD(U) settled for 101 seats each, smaller allies — Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM and Upendra Kushwaha’s RLM — received only six seats apiece.This distribution positions Chirag as a key player in post-poll arithmetic, regardless of how the NDA performs overall.As for the BJP is concerned, the party seems to trying to thread the needle between coalition harmony and long-term dominance. If Nitish remains on board, BJP retains stability; if Chirag’s LJP strengthens, BJP gains leverage and a younger, more dynamic ally with reach into new caste and regional segments.Whether this triangular arrangement can sustain itself through the campaign — and beyond — will test the NDA’s cohesion like never before. Whether Nitish and Chirag truly coexist within the same alliance without their ambitions colliding remains to be seen.","BJP and JD(U) will contest 101 seats each in Bihar’s 243-seat assembly. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) (LJP(RV), led by Chirag Paswan, got 29 seats. For the first time, the BJP has secured equal seat-sharing in Bihar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124703765,imgsize-1031274,width-400,resizemode-4/images-11.jpg"

Shah Avoids Naming Bihar CM Face, Says Bihar CM to Be Decided by Elected MLAs

Maithili Thakur: The Mithila pride card



Khesari Lal Yadav: RJD’s bid for the masses



The BJP-Pawan Singh reunion



The caste arithmetic



NEW DELHI: Bihar’s election stage has always had drama, but this time, the script has a cinematic twist. Folk singer Maithili Thakur , and Bhojpuri actors Khesari Lal Yadav and Pawan Singh , have all entered the political frame, turning the 2025 assembly battle into a fusion of star power and caste calculation.The BJP has fielded Maithili Thakur from Alinagar in Darbhanga, while the RJD has handed its Chapra ticket to Khesari Lal Yadav. Adding to the intrigue, Pawan Singh, who was once at odds with the BJP, has rejoined the party after months of speculation.Together, the three represent how Bihar’s two biggest parties are turning to popular faces from music and cinema to stir old loyalties and reshape caste equations.Alinagar sits in the heart of the Mithila region, where identity and language carry deep cultural pride. The BJP’s choice of Maithili Thakur is not just a nod to local sentiment but also a tactical move to expand appeal in a seat that has been closely fought.The constituency has shifted hands several times in recent years, and margins have been narrow. Maithili, a household name in the region, brings a blend of youth connect and cultural symbolism that the BJP hopes can widen its support base beyond traditional voters.Her campaign songs and folk roots are expected to draw attention across caste lines, especially among women and young voters who form a decisive chunk of the electorate.If the BJP is playing the Mithila card, the RJD has chosen to bank on Bhojpuri stardom. Khesari Lal Yadav’s candidature from Chapra in Saran district is designed to add glamour to a contest that has long been decided by caste arithmetic.Chapra has traditionally been a battleground between Yadavs and Rajputs, and the RJD’s decision to field Khesari is an attempt to consolidate the Yadav vote while energising youth and migrant workers who idolise him. The BJP won Chapra in 2020, but with thin margins. Khesari’s popularity among lower and backward castes gives the RJD a chance to turn that equation on its head.The party hopes that his folk appeal, built through music that often celebrates aspiration and struggle, will connect emotionally with voters who see politics through the lens of identity and pride rather than policy.The BJP’s patch-up with Pawan Singh was as political as it was pragmatic. A Rajput by caste and a massive name in the Bhojpuri entertainment industry, Singh had previously rebelled and flirted with contesting independently. His differences with the BJP had threatened to split the Rajput vote, especially in the Shahabad and Bhojpur regions where caste balance is delicate.His return to the party fold is a calculated move to heal that rift. BJP leaders believe Singh’s presence will help consolidate upper-caste support and attract younger, entertainment-driven voters who identify with his larger-than-life persona. The party has suffered from factionalism in parts of Shahabad, and Singh’s popularity in districts like Arrah, Buxar, and Karakat could help the BJP offset anti-incumbency and regain lost ground.According to Census data and voter surveys, the caste profile of these regions explains why the BJP and RJD chose their celebrity candidates so carefully. In Darbhanga’s Alinagar, upper castes, especially Maithil Brahmins and Rajputs, together account for about 25 to 30 per cent of the electorate, while Yadavs, Muslims, and EBC groups form the rest.Maithili Thakur’s candidature appeals directly to the Maithil Brahmin identity and to cultural pride cutting across caste lines. In Saran’s Chapra, Yadavs make up roughly 20 to 22 per cent, Rajputs and Bhumihars about 15 to 18 per cent, and EBCs and Muslims the remainder.That arithmetic explains why the RJD placed its faith in Khesari Lal Yadav to deepen Yadav consolidation while reaching EBC and lower-caste Bhojpuri voters who relate to him.Further west, in the Shahabad and Bhojpur belt, where Pawan Singh holds sway, Rajputs and Bhumihars together exceed 25 per cent, making them a crucial bloc for the BJP to retain. His re-entry aims to keep that segment united and offset the erosion seen in parts of Arrah and Karakat during 2024.While celebrity names attract attention, they do not always convert into victories. Bihar’s elections are fought at the booth level, where caste networks, local loyalty, and the ground machinery of parties still decide outcomes.Maithili’s appeal may help the BJP in Mithila, but it will need organisational muscle to translate her popularity into votes. Khesari’s fame gives the RJD visibility, but turning fans into voters requires the kind of micro-level mobilisation that only a well-oiled party machine can provide.Pawan Singh’s Rajput credentials may strengthen the BJP’s caste equation, but overreliance on charisma can backfire if local candidates fail to deliver on expectations.The entry of Maithili Thakur, Khesari Lal Yadav, and Pawan Singh has turned Bihar’s election into a curious blend of celebrity, caste, and calculation. The BJP and RJD are both using star power to energise their bases, yet beneath the glamour, it remains a story about numbers, of seats, votes, and social groups.","The BJP has fielded Maithili Thakur from Alinagar in Darbhanga. The RJD has handed its Chapra ticket to Khesari Lal Yadav.

ED Arrests Ex-CM Bhupesh Baghel's Son in ₹1,000 Crore Case, Congress Cries Political Vendetta

.

NEW DELHI: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel on Monday said he was denied permission by the Centre to meet his son, Chaitanya Baghel, who is currently in jail.He alleged that his son’s imprisonment was politically motivated and expressed frustration over being barred from a family visit during the Diwali festival.In a post on X, Baghel shared his frustration recalling that during previous governments, family visits on festive occasions were allowed.He wrote: “Two decades ago, Chief Minister Ajit Jogi had sent Babuji to jail, but permission to meet him on Diwali had been granted. By the grace of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, my son is in jail. Today is Diwali, but I do not have permission to meet him. I still wish everyone Diwali greetings.”Speaking to ANI reporters in Durg, Congress leader alleged that his son’s imprisonment was politically motivated and claimed he was being denied basic visitation rights usually allowed to prisoners during festivals.“My son is in jail due to the actions of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi. Prisoners are allowed to meet their families during festivals like Raksha Bandhan, Eid, and Diwali.But I am not being allowed to meet my son this Diwali,” Baghel said.He also recalled that during previous governments, such restrictions were not imposed.“Twenty years ago, when my father was in jail, the whole family met him during Diwali. But now, under PM Modi’s government, such meetings are being denied,” he added.Baghel further alleged that his family was being targeted for opposing industrial projects.“Adani was cutting down trees in Tamnar. When I protested, my son was jailed. That is the reason for his arrest,” he said.He claimed other relatives have also been prevented from visiting Chaitanya, calling it a “complete ban” on family meetings during the festival.Chaitanya Baghel was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on July 18 in connection with an ongoing investigation into an alleged multi-crore liquor scam in Chhattisgarh.The former CM described his son’s detention as an act of political vendetta and an example of silencing dissent.","Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said he was denied permission by the Centre to meet his son, Chaitanya Baghel.

DRDO's Combat Parachute System Successfully Tested; IAF Soldiers Perform 32,000 Ft Jump

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has finalised a technology transfer agreement with a Pune-based defence company for the production of the unexploded ordnance handling robot (UXOR), which is designed to neutralise ordnance weighing up to 1,000 kg.The agreement with DRDO positions Sagar Defence Engineering as one of the primary industry partners, alongside Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), for scaling up production of UXOR units, which are set to be deployed by the IAF to enhance operational safety during unexploded ordnance handling missions across sensitive zones, including forward airbases and strategic installations, a company source told TOI.Developed indigenously by DRDO over the last decade, UXOR represents a quantum leap in autonomous and semi-autonomous bomb disposal systems. Its key features include high-powered water jet cutting technology, precise disarming of explosive ordnance by cutting through bomb casings up to 25 mm thick and performing remote operation from a distance of up to 2 km — meaning operators can manage high-risk ordnance from a safe distance, thus reducing the possibility of human injuries or casualties.UXOR enables cross-terrain mobility, allowing operations on surfaces, such as airstrips, tarmacs and rugged terrains, and is capable of continuous six-hour missions, suitable for extended bomb disposal or reconnaissance operations.Sources familiar with the project said UXOR has undergone extensive trials with the IAF, including simulated bomb disposal exercises and real-world field testing at secure locations. Its performance has reportedly exceeded expectations, particularly in precision handling and operational reliability under stress conditions.Under a ToT agreement, DRDO will provide Sagar Defence, alongside BEL, with complete access to UXOR’s design documentation, manufacturing protocols, software integration, quality assurance standards and field maintenance procedures. A senior source hinted that this initiative is part of a broader DRDO strategy to increasingly involve private and public sector partners for rapid deployment of advanced defence technologies, reducing reliance on in-house production.The contract requires delivery of multiple UXOR units over the next two fiscal years, training of IAF personnel in robot operation, maintenance and emergency protocols and field deployment support during initial operational integration at selected bases.","The unexploded ordnance handling robot (UXOR) is designed to neutralise ordnance weighing up to 1,000 kg.

Piyush Goyal Says India Aims to Remain the Fastest-Growing Large Economy for the Next 20 Years

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, representing 134 companies from 27 countries, including India, has urged world leaders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon resilient economy.The CEO-led alliance, one of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) flagship decarbonisation initiatives, has issued an open letter calling on govts to deepen public-private collaboration to unlock the full potential of the climate economy at a time when the transition is under threat. It underlined the current trajectories that suggest that global warming could exceed 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century, with severe consequences on economies, societies and ecosystems.The Alliance companies have a combined emissions footprint of 5.2 gigatons, accounting for 14% of global emissions — equal to the annual emissions of the US, which second after China. The group represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 134 companies.Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.CEOs of big tech multi-national companies are also part of the group.The WEF noted that these companies reduced aggregate emissions by 12% while growing revenue by 20% from 2019 to 2023, proving that climate action is compatible with driving growth.Their open letter, released by the WEF this month, calls for 13 action areas to accelerate the transition and drive growth. It highlights the need for policymakers to provide more stable frameworks, shorten permitting processes, scale climate finance, support breakthrough technologies, phase out unabated fossil fuels and invest in nature and resilience.“Climate action is no longer just a moral imperative — it is a powerful driver of green growth, innovation and resilience,” said Sebastian Buckup, managing director, Centre for Nature and Climate, WEF. “We urge govts and business leaders to act decisively and accelerate proven solutions so we can unlock the full potential of the climate economy and secure a more prosperous, sustainable future for all. Our work at the forum aims to connect leaders for people, planet and sustainable progress,” the WEF quoted him as saying.The Alliance’s open letter highlights that the corporate leaders across the world have made significant investments in building low-carbon and climate resilient businesses in the recent years, proving that climate initiatives can drive long-term value for business and society.“However, this momentum now faces strong headwinds. The cost of the transition, combined with policy obstacles and uncertainties, fiscal pressures and geopolitical tensions, is slowing the transition. COP30 presents a pivotal moment for business and government to reignite progress towards a more resilient and environmentally sustainable economy,” say the CEOs in their joint open letter to govts.They suggest that the policy-makers can drive growth and create wealth by accelerating the transition by maintaining a stable and predictable policy environment; mitigating the financial risk of private investments and projects; doubling financing and incentives for breakthrough tech; transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels; removing transition obstacles such as lengthy permitting processes; and supporting investments and policies for nature.Their remaining suggestions in the list of 13 proposed actions include building climate-resilient economies and food systems; adopting science-based targets and reporting transparently on progress on emission reduction; working together across the value chain to drive low-emission end products and business models; leveraging efficiency solutions to reduce energy usage, costs and emissions; strengthen innovation and digital solutions; support creation of demand signals; and investment in climate adaptation and resilience.","Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance.

MUMBAI: Closing ranks ahead of the civic elections, the opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1 against “arbitrary and corrupt administration of Election Commission”.The announcement was made Sunday, just after Raj accused EC of inserting 96 lakh fake voters in the electoral lists across Maharashtra for the benefit of those in office. “An attempt is being made to finish off regional parties... 8-10 lakh fake voters have been added in Mumbai and 8-8.5 lakh in Thane, Pune and Nashik each,” Raj said at a party meeting.This will be the first time Congress and MNS cadres will be marching together amid rumblings in the national party’s city unit over an alliance, even though the two parties have been part of the opposition’s meeting with EC on electoral lists.

Addressing MNS booth-level agents, he urged them to verify the lists to weed out fake voters. “If polls have to be held peacefully, then clean the electoral list first,” he warned. Without naming BJP, he said the party in office wanted to contest elections by adding fake names to the voters’ list. “It does not matter whether you cast a vote or not. The match has been fixed.

BENGALURU: The feud between Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar and two of Bengaluru’s most prominent corporate captains — Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai — escalated Sunday over the city’s crumbling infrastructure.Mazumdar-Shaw hit back at Shivakumar’s remarks that those criticising govt’s handling of Bengaluru’s civic issues had a “personal agenda” and had remained silent during previous administrations.“Not true. Both TV Mohandas Pai and I have criticised deteriorating infrastructure in our city to previous BJP and JD(S) govts.

We should not forget our roots,” read a statement from his office after his ‘Walk with Bengaluru’ event.He listed ongoing infrastructure projects — tunnel roads, elevated corridors, double-decker flyovers, and buffer roads — costing more than Rs 1 lakh crore, claiming they aim for “integrated development” of the city.“We have formed five corporations to take governance closer to people,” he added.Later in the day, Mazumdar-Shaw softened her tone and responded positively to the Ejipura flyover project update. “This is a positive development which will greatly relieve traffic congestion and has been 10 years in the making, which previous BJP and JD(S) govts did not prioritise. Putting this on a priority track is a good move by DK Shivakumar,” she posted on X.The public spat underscored growing frustration among Bengaluru’s business bosses and citizens over chronic traffic snarls, delayed civic projects, and governance gridlock in India’s technology capital.For his part, Pai had said the city’s infrastructure was “lagging 10-15 years behind its growth”. He stressed that citizens had the right to demand better infrastructure and criticise govt, saying “ministers are representatives, not ‘maliks’ who should fear free speech — they must listen”",Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai clashed over the city's crumbling infrastructure.

No undue leniency or excessive severity in sentencing: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-undue-leniency-or-excessive-severity-in-sentencing-sc/articleshow/124695123.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts and HCs against undue leniency or excessive severity while imposing punishment on a person convicted of an offence and said that deviation from this time-tested sentencing policy could erode public faith in the judiciary or lead to injustice.“Undue leniency can cause public confidence in the justice system to plummet, while excessive severity may lead to injustice,” ruled a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih while rejecting a plea for reduction of the eight-year sentence imposed on a youth who, in the heat of the moment during an altercation, struck a blow that led to the death of a man.The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister. His sister had given birth to a child on account of the sexual assault. The family of the man who raped the girl was unwilling to accede to the proposal to get the rape survivor married to him. The man was in jail on the charge of sexual assault. When the accused, with his family, was visiting the alleged rapist’s family to resolve the issue of his sister’s proposed marriage to him, an altercation broke out, in course of which the alleged rapist’s brother intervened in an effort to calm the situation.But the accused was so enraged by the sexual assault on his sister, coupled with the alleged rapist’s refusal to marry her, that he picked up an axe and gave a fatal blow to the one attempting to pacify the two sides.Senior advocate Rahul Kaushik told the court that the accused was merely 20 years old when the incident happened.Highlighting that the crime was not pre-meditated, he pleaded for leniency in sentence, which had been reduced to eight years by the HC from 10 years imposed by the trial court.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta agreed that the appellant may have been deprived of self-control because of his sister’s alleged rape at the hands of the man. But he found no sudden provocation in the circumstances to warrant the trial court's converting a murder case into a culpable homicide one.","The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister.

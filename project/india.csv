Conditions in December likely to mirror warm trend: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conditions-in-december-likely-to-mirror-warm-trend-imd/articleshow/115913507.cms,"Normal to above normal rainfall is likely over most parts of the country in November.

NEW DELHI: One of the main factors behind post-monsoon warm streak across country was a prolonged dry spell in most parts of the country, IMD said. With a deficit of nearly 55% in the country, rainfall during last month was the third lowest for Nov since 2001. Even south India, where northeast monsoon is active during this period, logged a shortfall of close to 38%, IMD data shows.For the upcoming winter season (Dec-Feb), IMD said both day and night conditions are likely to be milder than normal over most of India, with less than usual number of days of extreme cold. Minimum (night) temperatures are likely to be above normal over most parts of the country while maximum (day) temperatures are predicted to be above normal over most parts except for areas in south India.Conditions in Dec are likely to mirror the warm trend, with night temperatures significantly higher than normal in the south, central-eastern states such as Odisha and Chhattisgarh, as well as Jharkhand and Bihar. The forecast is contrary to expectations of a cold winter in line with the likely formation of La Nina conditions in the Pacific.""La Nina hasn't appeared yet and neutral conditions currently prevail in the Pacific. Even if La Nina sets in now, its impact on weather around the world, including India, will only be felt a couple of months later,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of IMD, adding, ""La Nina is not the only factor that impacts winter conditions in the country. There were no western disturbances that affected north India in Nov, leading to dry conditions in the region. While it is difficult to make forecasts about western disturbances on a monthly scale, it is likely that the trend seen in Nov will continue. If that happens, temperatures will remain on the higher side, at least in north India.""IMD's data for Nov shows a clear trend of higher temperatures in recent years, in line with global warming. For instance, the five warmest months of Nov in terms of maximum temperatures in India have all come in the last 25 years.","Dry spell in most parts of the country was one of the main factors behind post- monsoon warm streak.

They have chosen weapons over the welfare of their people. So, good luck to them,"" he said, adding that his force was fully prepared to ensure no country could harm India's strategic interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).China, with over 360 warships and submarines, has been assiduously increasing its ""underwater domain awareness"" in the IOR through its almost permanent deployment of survey and research 'spy' vessels in the region to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations. ""Many Pakistan Navy warships and submarines are being built with China's support, showing that China is interested in making the Pakistan Navy stronger"", the Navy chief said.China has already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates to Pakistan, and eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines will now be delivered from 2025-26 onwards. ""These eight new submarines will add significant combat potential to the Pakistan Navy. We are fully aware of their capabilities. That is why we are tweaking our plans and concepts to negate any infringement of our interests. We are fully ready to take on any challenge,"" Admiral Tripathi said.""Our reading is that it (Chinese Navy) will manifest more in the Pacific Ocean, but we are keeping a watch to ensure that our interests in the IOR are not affected,"" the Navy chief added.","India is tweaking its operational plans and strategy to tackle the expanding collusiveness between Islamabad and Beijing in the maritime domain after the land borders.

'Why do babus' wives hold ex officio posts in societies?': Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-do-babus-wives-hold-ex-officio-posts-in-societies-supreme-court/articleshow/115912320.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday took strong exception to bureaucrats' wives enjoying posts in societies functioning within the administrative jurisdictions of their husbands and said such practices, a product of colonial mindset , must be forthwith discarded.What irked a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan was the vindictive action indirectly taken by the district magistrate of Bulandshahr, where it had been a custom since inception in 1957 till 2019 to make the wife of the officiating district magistrate or his nominee hold the office of president of the Zila Mahila Samiti , Bulandshahr.The general body of the Samiti in Jan 2020 by a majority amended the bylaws and decided not to give its presidency to the DM's wife by recognising her only as a patron. This change was approved by the deputy registrar of societies. After election to all posts, including the president, was held in Sept 2022, the deputy registrar sent a show-cause notice based on a secret inquiry by the city magistrate, who alleged that articles of association of the Samiti were illegally amended to gobble up the property of the organisation.Appearing for the Samiti, senior advocate Tapesh Kumar Singh said the inquiry was conducted by the magistrate without summoning any office bearer or a visit to the Samiti office. Despite a detailed response, the deputy registrar on Feb 17, 2023, declared the amendments illegal without even granting a hearing to the parties. This order meant the DM's wife would continue to be president of the Samiti. The body moved Allahabad HC, which dismissed its plea.SC took umbrage and said, ""Why does she want to hold the post of president of the Samiti based on her husband's position? If she wants to be the president of the Samiti, she should join politics and contest elections.""Appearing for UP, additional solicitor general K M Natraj told SC, govt wants to get rid of this colonial mindset and sought its permission to do so in view of the HC order.""The colonial mindset of giving ex-official positions to family members of administrative authorities must be erased by bringing suitable amendments through a model bylaw that would clearly define the composition of the governing body of societies,"" SC said. It said it would make it mandatory for all societies, whether aided or not aided by the govt, to mandatorily follow the model bylaws, failing which they would be declared non-entities under the law.""Let an appropriate draft amendment/model bylaw be placed before the court in six weeks,"" the bench said, while restraining the Samiti to carry on its work without the DM's wife being part of the governing body.",Supreme Court took strong exception to bureaucrats' wives enjoying posts in societies. Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said such practices must be forthwith discarded. It had been a custom since inception in 1957 till 2019 to make the wife of the officiating district magistrate hold the office of president of the Zila Mahila Samiti.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115912340,imgsize-1943794,width-400,resizemode-4/115912340.jpg"
198 colleges mum on stipends get NMC show-cause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/198-colleges-mum-on-stipends-get-nmc-show-cause/articleshow/115912151.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Medical Commission (NMC) has issued show-cause notices to 198 medical colleges - 115 govt and 83 private - across the country over non-submission of details of stipend paid to undergraduate interns, postgraduate residents and senior residents.All medical colleges were directed to submit to NMC the stipend paid for the financial year 2023-24 following a Supreme Court directive. However, officials said, the 198 colleges that have been issued show-cause notices failed to comply leading to the action.An online survey conducted by NMC last year revealed 27% of PG students are not paid any stipend by private/self-financed medical colleges. There are 54% PG students who receive less than the amount paid to their counterparts in govt-run medical colleges.More importantly, the survey conducted among 7,901 PG students from 213 self-financed/private medical colleges spread across 19 states revealed 16% PG students had to return the stipend money to college management.After this, NMC, the apex body for regulating medical education and profession, directed all self-financed and private medical colleges to pay stipend equal to the amount being paid to PG students of state or centre-run medical institutions in the state/UT where they are located, as per Regulation 13 of Post-Graduate Medical Education Regulation (PGMER), 2000.""All the self-financed/private medical colleges are warned that NMC will take strict action for non-compliance of the provisions of the Regulations of PGMER, 2000 if any complaint is received in future,"" NMC said.All medical graduates pursuing PG courses are entitled to a stipend.

We should be able to sign them by next month, if not earlier,"" Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said on Monday, adding the recent induction of the second nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arighaat has strengthened the country's underwater leg of the ""nuclear triad"".Speaking ahead of Navy Day on Wednesday, he said the nuclear-capable K-4 missile, with a strike range of 3,500 km, was test-fired from INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Nov 27, as was first reported by TOI.""The launch was successful, and the agencies concerned are examining the trajectory (and other parameters) ...we will soon know the results,"" he said. INS Arighaat will join the first SSBN, INS Arihant, which is armed only with the 750-km K-15 missiles, on ""deterrent patrols"" on completing her trials. The third SSBN will be commissioned as INS Aridhaman early next year.On the conventional warfare front, the first of the two 9,800-tonne nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), cleared by the PM-headed cabinet committee on security (CCS) for Rs 40,000 crore in Oct will be ready for induction by 2036-37, followed by the second one a couple of years later.The Navy, at present, has 63 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, apart from two guided-missile frigates built in Russia, in tune with India's continuing quest to build a stronger blue-water force .The over 130-warship Navy, with 150 aircraft and 130 helicopters, also has the initial approval or 'acceptance of necessity' (AoN) for another 31 warships.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 155-160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships.The around Rs 63,000-crore deal for the direct acquisition of 22 single-seat Rafale jets and four twin-seat trainers for aircraft carriers, along with weapons, simulator, spares, crew training and logistics support, is just ""one level short"" of being sent for the final approval by the CCS. ""Since it is a govt-to-govt deal, it should not take much time,"" Admiral Tripathi said.The three additional Scorpenes, in turn, will be built at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) for around Rs 36,000 crore, with the first slated to roll out in six years.","India on course to sign two more mega defence deals with France for 26 Rafale- Marine fighter jets and three additional Scorpene submarines.

Sambhal Mosque Controversy: ASI Alleges Alterations and Cover-up of Historical Well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/sambhal-mosque-controversy-asi-alleges-alterations-and-cover-up-of-historical-well/articleshow/115872871.cms,"BAREILLY: In response to a petition filed by the Kaila Devi temple trust, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), one of the respondents in the Sambhal mosque case, filed a reply in the court of the senior division on Saturday.District govt counsel (civil) Prince Sharma, who submitted a written statement (WS) in court, said, ""The petition says the mosque -- Sambhal's Jama Masjid -- is protected by the ASI. The custody of it should be given to the right authority so that it can be protected and people may visit there. ASI was made a party by the plaintiffs and now we've filed our WS.""Sharma further said, ""As of now, the ASI cannot do any inspection of the mosque due to the fear of local protesters. In 2018, we received a complaint that a railing was being made at the mosque and when ASI tried to stop the committee from doing so, officials were threatened and they had to leave. An FIR under sections 30A and 30B of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, was registered on Jan 19, 2018, against the Jama mosque committee at Sambhal police station and a month later, the additional divisional commissioner ordered the removal of the railing, but the order was never implemented.""An ASI official, on the condition of anonymity, added, ""The monument was declared ‘protected' in 1920 and provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act are applicable here. We've mentioned in the WS that the situation is tough for us as we cannot enter for inspection, which is why its present status is not known to ASI. The most recent inspection of the mosque was done on June 25 this year under heavy police presence.""""We found that the original form of the mosque is lost as the mosque committee painted the place with enamel and used plaster of paris for repair work. Actual old flooring was replaced by a marble floor,"" he further said.A copy of the June inspection was accessed by TOI, which says that during the inspection, the ASI team found an ""inscription"" saying that the ""Jami Masjid was constructed by Meer Hindu Begh in 1526 and it was repaired in 1620 by Syed Qutub and in 1656 by Rustom Khan"". The survey report further states that the team found an old well on the left side entrance of the mosque, which has been now covered by the committee, and a large room for security forces is prepared on it. There is a mention of the ""well"" on page 10 of ‘The Monumental Antiquities and Inscriptions in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh'. The survey team also found that the ""rooms"" made in the lower portion of the mosque were converted into shops and they were rented out by the committee.When queried about the alleged alterations, Zafar Ali of the mosque committee, told TOI on Sunday: ""The room was constructed for making a police outpost after an imam was murdered inside the mosque. This is a registered police outpost and the railing was prepared at that time only. We have all the related documents.""","Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), one of the respondents in the Sambhal mosque case, filed a reply in the court of the senior division on Saturday.

Mahayuti leaders' meeting cancelled again: Is 'sulking' Eknath Shinde delaying govt formation talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-leaders-meeting-cancelled-again-is-sulking-eknath-shinde-delaying-govt-formation-talks/articleshow/115903768.cms,"Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Is ""sulking"" Eknath Shinde delaying the formation of BJP-led Mahayuti government in Maharashtra? Nine days after Mahayuti won a ""Maha"" mandate, there is still no end to the ""Maha"" suspense on the contours of the next government. For the second time in the last four days, a meeting of the Mahayuti leaders had to be cancelled on Monday due to the unavailability of caretaker chief minister Shinde, who was taking rest at his Thane residence as per doctor's advice.It was Shinde who had told reporters on Sunday that he and the two deputy CMs (BJP's Devendra Fadnavis and NCP chief Ajit Pawar ) would take forward the discussions on Monday on the chief minister's post, distribution of portfolios and party-wise berths in the new Cabinet.Shinde, Fadnvais and Ajit Pawar had held their first meeting in the national capital last week in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda but failed to reach a consensus on power-sharing agreement. The much-awaited second meeting of the Mahayuti leaders last Friday was put on hold after Shinde suddenly flew to his native village Dare in Satara district citing ill health.Immediately after the Maha verdict, several Shiv Sena leaders orchestrated a campaign for continuance of Shinde as the next chief minister, despite BJP winning 132 seats on its own in the 288-member assembly. They even cited the Bihar model of Nitish Kumar to push their case for Shinde. Some Sena leaders even claimed that the BJP had promised to give Shinde the top job irrespective of the numbers.It was four days after the Maha verdict that Eknath Shinde finally announced that he would not be an obstacle in government formation and hinted that he is also ready to quit the top post. However, Shiv Sena's silence on his future role in the Mahayuti government since then has added to the suspense and led to speculations. Reports say Shiv Sena is insisting on the home portfolio which was with Fadnavis when he was the deputy chief minister under Shinde.Meanwhile, the BJP, which is set to get its own chief minister in the state after a gap of five years, seems to be moving ahead with government formation. After announcing the oath-taking ceremony date two days back, the BJP today said that the next Mahayuti leader will be finalised on December 4, when the newly-elected party MLAs meet in the presence of central observers Nirmala Sitharaman and Vijay Rupani. While some BJP leaders have hinted at the return of Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister, the formal announcement will go down to the wire and will be made on the eve of oath-taking ceremony scheduled for December 5.Fadnavis has the backing of Ajit Pawar, the third ally of the Mahayuti, who has taken away all the bargaining powers of the Shiv Sena. In the November 20 elections, the Mahayuti won 230 of the 288 assembly seats decimating the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi. The BJP led with 132 seats, while the Shiv Sena got 57 and NCP 41 seats.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader and Eknath Shinde's son Shrikant Shinde on Monday responded to the speculations of him becoming Maharashtra's deputy chief minister and said that he ""has no desire for a post of power"".Shrikant in his post on X refuted the claims of being in the race for any ministerial position in the state."" The swearing-in ceremony of the grand coalition government has been a bit delayed, and currently there is a lot of discussion and rumours. Caretaker chief minister Hon. Shri Eknath Shinde went to the village for two days and rested due to ill health. So the rumors flourished. The news that I will be the deputy chief minister has been given with question marks for the last two days. As a matter of fact there is no truth in it and all the news about my post as deputy chief minister is baseless and baseless,"" Shrikant said.","Mahayuti won 230 of the 288 assembly seats decimating the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi.

'Deeply regrettable': India after breach on Bangladesh assistant high commission premises in Agartala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deeply-regrettable-india-after-breach-of-bangladesh-assistant-high-commission-premises-in-agartala/articleshow/115901809.cms,"Supporters stage a protest over the violence against minorities in Bangladesh, at Sabroom in South Tripura (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday condemned the breach of the Bangladesh assistant high commission premises in Agartala, describing the incident as ""deeply regrettable"" and stressed that diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstance.“The incident earlier today of the breach of premises at the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala is deeply regrettable. Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances,” MEA said in a statement.“Government is taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and their deputy/assistant high commissions in the country,” the ministry added.Demonstrators allegedly broke into the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala to protest atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.The high commission breach comes after an Agartala-Kolkata bus traveling via Dhaka on Saturday reportedly faced an attack in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh after being involved in an accident on Vishwa Road.The breach comes amid escalating tensions between India and Bangladesh, exacerbated by rising attacks on Hindus and their places of worship in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this year. The political instability in Bangladesh has coincided with a series of mob attacks, intensifying concerns for the safety of the Hindu minority community.The tension rose further after the arrest of prominent Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, a vocal advocate for minority rights. Das was detained at Dhaka airport in October on charges of allegedly disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally. The specifics of the allegations remain vague, and Das has been denied bail.The external affairs ministry had said that the Indian government has taken the incidents of attacks on minorities seriously and communicated its concerns to Bangladesh authorities.","The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday condemned the breach of the Bangladesh assistant high commission premises in Agartala.

The deluge also disrupted rail and road traffic, leaving passengers stranded for hours.Visuals from Krishnagiri’s Uthangiri bus station showed several buses and vehicles submerged in floodwaters. In some instances, buses and cars were swept away by the rapidly flowing waters. Footage showed vehicles, including those operated by local tour operators, being dragged off roads in Uthangarai and into low-lying areas. Connectivity between Uthangarai and nearby towns such as Krishnagiri and Tiruvannamalai was severely impacted, further isolating the region.Parts of Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts witnessed record-breaking floods, with rainfall levels unseen in two decades. Uthangarai recorded a staggering 50 cm of rainfall, while Villupuram district received up to 42 cm, and Harur in Dharmapuri registered 33 cm. Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai recorded 16 cm each within 24 hours, from December 1 morning to the following day.The flooding has forced thousands into relief camps. Villupuram district authorities reported that 3,617 individuals have been housed in 65 relief shelters, supported by 15 active disaster relief teams.Raging floodwaters have overwhelmed low-lying areas, marooning neighborhoods and villages across Villupuram, Krishnagiri, and Dharmapuri districts. In Krishnagiri, the Pochampalli police station was submerged under three feet of water, with torrents rushing through its premises.Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release Rs 2,000 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for emergency restoration and rehabilitation efforts. Stalin highlighted that the cyclone caused unprecedented havoc across 14 districts, impacting 1.5 crore people, submerging 2.11 lakh hectares of farmland, and severely damaging critical infrastructure.","The flooding has forced thousands into relief camps.

NEW DELHI: A man was booked in Lucknow for allegedly claiming to be an IAS officer and threatening to kill an LLB student if she refused to marry him, police said on Monday.The suspect, Deepak Kumar, has been charged at Lucknow's Chinhat police station based on a complaint filed by the victim's mother on November 30.According to the complaint, Kumar first contacted the woman through WhatsApp in 2020. He claimed to be from Bihar's East Champaran district and shared his Aadhaar details.Kumar said he had completed a BTech degree in Haryana and claimed to be an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer in training in Delhi. However, the woman later discovered that Kumar worked for a private company in Delhi that dealt with computer-related work, news agency PTI reported.The complaint said that Kumar hacked mobile phones of girls and pressured them to marry him. He had allegedly cheated two or three other women, and a case was already ongoing against him.The complainant said her daughter did not know Kumar personally and that there were no discussions about marriage between them or their families.Kumar is accused of sending abusive and threatening messages to the woman’s relatives to pressure her into marriage.According to the complaint, Kumar threatened to harm the woman with petrol or acid and burn her if she refused his marriage proposal.Police have registered a case against Kumar under sections 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of peace), 351(2) ( criminal intimidation ), and 79 (word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Bhartiya Nayaya Sanhita, along with the IT (Amendment) Act.

Mega Rafale fighter & Scorpene sub deals to be inked with France by next month: Navy chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mega-rafale-fighter-scorpene-sub-deals-to-be-inked-with-france-by-next-month-navy-chief/articleshow/115907850.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the Rs 32,350 crore contract with the US for 31 armed MQ-9B `Predator’ drones done and dusted, India is now firmly on course to soon ink another two mega defence deals for 26 Rafale-Marine fighter jets and three additional Scorpene submarines , collectively worth around Rs 1 lakh crore, with France.“Both the deals for Rafales and Scorpenes are in the final stages. We should be able to sign them by next month, if not earlier,” Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said on Monday, while asserting that the recent induction of the second nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arighaat had strengthened the country’s underwater leg of the “nuclear triad”.Speaking ahead of the Navy Day on Wednesday, he confirmed that the nuclear-capable K-4 missile, with a strike range of 3,500-km, was test-fired from INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Nov 27, as was first reported by TOI.“The launch was successful, and the agencies concerned are examining the trajectory (and other parameters) …we will soon know the results,” he said. INS Arighaat will join the first SSBN, INS Arihant, which is armed only with the 750-km K-15 missiles, on “deterrent patrols” on completing her trials. The third SSBN will be commissioned as INS Aridhaman early next year.On the conventional warfare front, the first of the two 9,800-tonne nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) for Rs 40,000 crore in Oct, in turn, will be ready for induction by 2036-37, followed by the second one a couple of years later.The Navy currently has 63 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, apart from two guided-missile frigates built in Russia, in tune with India’s continuing quest to build a stronger blue-water force to protect its huge geostrategic interests as well as counter China’s ever-expanding footprint in Indian Ocean Region (IOR).The over 130-warship Navy, with 150 aircraft and 130 helicopters, also has the initial approval or `acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines, apart from the three additional Scorpenes.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 155-160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships.The around Rs 63,000 crore deal for the direct acquisition of 22 single-seat Rafale jets and four twin-seat trainers for aircraft carriers, along with weapons, simulator, spares, crew training and logistics support, is just “one level short” of being sent for the final approval by the CCS. “Since it is a govt-to-govt deal, it should not take much time,” Admiral Tripathi said.The three additional Scorpenes, in turn, will be built at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) for around Rs 36,000 crore, with the first slated to roll out in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each. They will add to the six French-origin Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’. The sixth and the last boat, `Vagsheer’, is slated to be commissioned soon.","India is on course to soon ink two mega defence deals for 26 Rafale-Marine fighter jets and three additional Scorpene submarines with France.

NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Saturday expressed deep concern over the disappearance of 56-year-old Meitei man Laishram Kamalbabu from the Leimakhong Army camp, calling the incident “very unfortunate.” He criticised the event occurring within the Army campus and assured that both the central and state governments are prioritising efforts to locate Kamalbabu.""The Central government has asked the concerned authority to find out the person's whereabouts and the state govt has also sent the team in search of the missing person. Our common agenda is to find the missing person and it is very unfortunate that such an incident happened inside the Army campus,"" he said.Kamalbabu, who had been supervising work for a contractor with the Military Engineering Services (MES) at the Leimakhong military station, went missing on November 25. He had left his home in Imphal West at 9 am for work, but failed to return later that afternoon. His family reported his disappearance after attempts to contact him failed. Kamalbabu’s younger brother filed a missing person's report, stating that Kamalbabu had been seen inside the Army campus, accompanied by a Nepali individual, before his phone was switched off.The Indian Army had launched an extensive search operation, which includes ground combing, drone surveillance, and aerial platforms in the military station and surrounding villages. The defence public relations office confirmed that the search was ramped up after they received the missing person report, which came on the evening of November 25. Despite these efforts, Kamalbabu’s whereabouts remain unknown.A joint action committee, formed by local residents, staged a sit-in protest in Imphal West on Wednesday, demanding that the Army ensure Kamalbabu’s safe return. The protesters insisted that the Indian Army be held accountable for the incident, calling for immediate action to locate the missing man.Chief minister Biren Singh said that the Army holds responsibility for tracing Kamalbabu, especially considering the gravity of the situation. He acknowledged the ongoing unrest caused by the incident, coming on the heels of another tragedy in Jiribam, where three women and three children were killed. Singh confirmed that the state government, alongside the Army, has been in touch with central officials to expedite the search.","Laishram Kamalbabu, 56, went missing from the Leimakhong Army camp on November 25.

Pakistan choosing weapons over welfare of its people: Navy chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-choosing-weapons-over-welfare-of-its-people-navy-chief/articleshow/115897995.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan is choosing weapons over the welfare of its people despite its precarious economic condition, Admiral Dinesh Tripathi said on Monday, adding that India is tweaking its operational plans and strategy to tackle the expanding collusiveness between Islamabad and Beijing in the maritime domain after the land borders.""We are keeping a watch on extra-regional forces in the IOR, including the PLA Navy, their warships and research vessels, and know what they are doing and where they are,” the Navy chief said.“We are also aware of the surprising growth of the Pakistan Navy, which aims to become a 50-warship force. They have chosen weapons over the welfare of their people. So, good luck to them,” he said, adding that his force was fully prepared to ensure no country could harm India’s strategic interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).China, with the world’s largest Navy with over 360 warships and submarines, has been assiduously increasing its “underwater domain awareness” in the IOR through its almost permanent deployment of survey and research ‘spy’ vessels in the region to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Concurrently, “many Pakistan Navy warships and submarines are being built with China’s support, showing that China is interested in making the Pakistan Navy stronger”, Admiral Tripathi said.China has already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates to Pakistan, and eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines will now be delivered from 2025-26 onwards.“These eight new submarines will add significant combat potential to the Pakistan Navy. We are fully aware of their capabilities. That is why we are tweaking our plans and concepts to negate any infringement of our interests. We are fully ready to take on any challenge,” Admiral Tripathi said.While acknowledging that oceans are open to all nations, the Navy chief was clear that India will not tolerate any actions that undermines its security. “Our reading is that it (Chinese Navy) will manifest more in the Pacific Ocean, but we are keeping a watch to ensure that our interests in the IOR are not affected,” he added.",India is tweaking its operational plans and strategy to tackle the expanding collusiveness between Islamabad and Beijing.

The Jathedar also instructed the SAD's working committee to accept Sukhbir Badal 's resignation as party president and form a committee to conduct elections for the post and other office-bearers within six months.The Jathedar in a further significant move announced the withdrawal of the title of 'Fakhre-e-Qaum' (Pride of the Community) from former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, father of Sukhbir Badal.The five Singh Sahibans (Sikh clergy) also issued religious punishments for other Sikh leaders who served as ministers in the Akali Cabinet between 2007 and 2017.Giani Raghbir Singh stated that both Sukhbir Badal, who was on a wheelchair due to a fractured leg, and rebel leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa have been instructed to sit outside the Golden Temple for one hour each for two days, dressed as 'sewadar'.

He had been declared 'tankhaiya' after rebel party leaders, including Chandumajra, Kaur, and others, appeared before the Akal Takht on July 1 and sought forgiveness for four ""mistakes"" during the SAD rule between 2007 and 2017. These included the failure to punish those responsible for the 2015 sacrilege incidents and pardoning Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in the 2007 blasphemy case.",The Sikh clergy at the Akal Takht on Monday issued a'tankhah'( religious punishment ) for Sukhbir Singh Badal.

Mamata Banerjee condemns Centre's inaction



BJP's Amit Malviya responds to Mamata's comments



NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday voiced her concerns over prevailing situation Bangladesh and urged the Centre to seek United Nations ' intervention in the neighbouring country.She proposed the deployment of an internationl peacekeeping mission to restore normalcy and called on PM Modi to take decisive action to rescue and rehabilitate persecuted Indians from Bangladesh.Speaking in the West Bengal assembly , Banerjee demanded the external affairs minister to make a statement in Parliament during the ongoing winter session on India’s stance regarding the situation in Bangladesh. ""If the Prime Minister is unavailable to address this issue, the EAM must step up and provide clarity,"" she stated.Bengal CM pointed out that as a state leader, she had limited jurisdiction over bilateral matters, but recent developments, including interactions with International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) representatives and families affected by the situation in Bangladesh, compelled her to raise the issue.""If necessary, the EAM should engage with Bangladeshi authorities and the UN to consider deploying peacekeeping forces,"" the CM said.Banerjee also proposed that West Bengal could offer shelter to persecuted Indians if needed. “We have no problem sharing our resources with those in need. There will be no shortage of food for them,” she added.The CM stressed the importance of maintaining harmony and fostering cordial relations among communities in Bangladesh. Referring to the arrest of 79Indian fishermen detained in Bangladeshi waters, she highlighted the need for their immediate release, recalling India’s swift return of Bangladeshi fishermen in similar circumstances.Banerjee targeted the Union government for its silence over the past ten days despite rising tensions in Bangladesh. She also indirectly questioned the BJP for calling for the closure of goods movement along the India-Bangladesh border. “As per international agreements, such actions are not within our jurisdiction and can only be enforced by the Centre,” she clarified.Meanwhile, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya criticised Banerjee’s comments, particularly her omission of the term “Hindus” while discussing the persecution of Indians in Bangladesh.In a post on X, Malviya wrote: “Mamata Banerjee says, ‘If required, we can rehabilitate Indians attacked in Bangladesh. We have no problem sharing our ‘one roti’ with them.’ She doesn’t use the word Hindus. This explains her opposition to the CAA, which was meant to give dignity to Bengali refugees, most of them Hindus, fleeing religious persecution. India will take care of all Indians around the world.

'Charted path that other emerging economies can emulate': Oxford university lauds PM Modi's 'PRAGATI' initiative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/charted-path-that-other-emerging-economies-can-emulate-oxford-university-lauds-pm-modis-initiative-pragati/articleshow/115903118.cms,"""

A recent study by the University of Oxford highlighted how Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship initiative has transformed the monitoring and resolution of government projects and has emerged as a global benchmark for governance innovation.Launched in 2015, PRAGATI, which stands for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation, has revolutionized the management of large-scale infrastructure projects and social sector programs in India.The Oxford report titledFrom Gridlock to Growth: How Leadership Enables India's PRAGATI Ecosystem to Power Progress,"" praises PRAGATI as a testament to India modernizing governance. It notes, “The platform symbolizes India's commitment to overcoming bureaucratic inertia and fostering a Team India mindset and culture of accountability and efficiency.”The Oxford study draws lessons from PRAGATI that are applicable to nations grappling with the Middle-Income Trap. It highlights that governance innovation, combined with strategic investments in infrastructure, can lay the foundation for sustained economic growth and social progress.“By embracing digital tools and fostering collaboration across all levels of government, India has charted a path that other emerging economies can emulate,” the report states, positioning PRAGATI as a global model for bridging governance gaps and driving progress.PRAGATI integrates real-time data, drone feeds, and video conferencing, enabling stakeholders from various government levels to collaborate on resolving complex challenges, such as land acquisition and inter-ministerial coordination. This data-driven approach has accelerated project timelines while ensuring that developmental benefits reach even the remotest regions of the country.The economic benefits of PRAGATI are significant. Citing studies by the Reserve Bank of India and the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, the Oxford report notes that every rupee spent on infrastructure through PRAGATI yields a multiplier effect of 2.5 to 3.5 rupees in GDP. This has bolstered India’s resilience during global economic uncertainties and contributed to sustained economic growth.Beyond economic gains, PRAGATI has advanced social progress and environmental sustainability. By fast-tracking projects in essential sectors such as roads, railways, water, and electricity, the platform has enhanced the quality of life for millions of Indians. Additionally, it has facilitated faster environmental clearances and promoted green technologies, ensuring that India’s development is inclusive and sustainable.","PRAGATI, which stands for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation, has revolutionized the management of large-scale infrastructure projects and social sector programs in India.

This November was warmest on record in north India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-november-was-warmest-on-record-in-north-india/articleshow/115911004.cms,"NEW DELHI: This Nov was the warmest on record in north India with the average mean temperature in the region crossing 20 degrees Celsius for the first time in records going back to 1901. Across the country, too, the month logged the second highest maximum temperatures, lower than only the Nov of 2016.Temperatures in Nov followed the trend in Oct, which was the warmest on record in India, making the post-monsoon months in the country among the warmest ever. The trend is likely to continue into the winter, IMD said while releasing its forecast for the Dec-Feb period on Monday.The average mean temperature in north India during Nov was 20.14 degrees Celsius, nearly 1.4 degrees above normal, beating the month's previous highest of 19.87 degrees C set in 1977, as per IMD data. Across India, the average maximum temperature during the month was 29.37 degrees C.One of the main factors behind the warm streak was prolonged dry spell in most parts of the country, IMD said. With a deficit of nearly 55% across India, rainfall during last month was the third lowest for Nov since 2001. Even south India, where the northeast monsoon is active during this period, logged a shortfall of close to 38%, IMD data shows.For the winter season (Dec-Feb), IMD said that both day and night conditions are likely to be milder than normal over most of India, with less than usual number of days of extreme cold. Conditions in Dec are likely to mirror the warm trend, with night temperatures significantly higher than normal in the south, central-eastern states.The forecast is contrary to expectations of a cold winter in line with the likely formation of La Nina conditions in the Pacific.

It said pollution levels kept rising between Nov 27 and 30, and decided to wait for a few days before relaxing the stringent conditions. The bench said it would take a decision on Grap restrictions on Dec 5.Noting that Delhi-NCR invariably faces an air-quality emergency every year between Oct and Dec, the apex court said it would go into all aspects of the air pollution problem and find a permanent solution. It highlighted the ""complete lack of coordination"" among stakeholders, including Delhi govt, Delhi Police, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the pollution control committee, in implementing the restrictions. The court also pulled up NCR states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana — for not taking steps to pay subsistence allowance to workers affected due to ban on construction work. It directed the chief secretaries of all NCR states to appear before it virtually on the next date of hearing.“Only if we summon the top officers will the ball start rolling,” the bench said after counsel appearing for states pleaded that no order be passed against the chief secretaries.“We make it clear that unless substantial compliance with actual payment of amounts to construction workers is reported, we will have to consider initiating action under the Contempt of Court Act against erring officers,” it said.Taking note of advocate Manan Verma’s submission that he was being targeted for discharging his duty as court commissioner to report violations of Grap-4 measures, the bench asked additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to brief the court about the action taken on his complaint.The Commission for Air Quality Management had urged the court to relax the stringent conditions in view of prevalent air quality forecast but the bench turned it down.

Reinstatement post bail: SC to study impact on witnesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reinstatement-post-bail-sc-to-study-impact-on-witnesses/articleshow/115910938.cms,"(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday decided to examine a plea seeking recall of its Sept 26 bail order to DMK 's Senthil Balaji on the ground that witnesses may not feel free to depose against a cabinet minister. Balaji was granted bail in a money laundering case linked to a cash-for-jobs scam.In what can have implications for similarly placed politicians, SC, which has recently modulated rigorous bail provisions of special laws like PMLA and UAPA by ruling that the principle 'bail is the rule and jail is the exception' is also applicable in these offences, indicated that it would send a wrong signal if a high-profile accused was re-inducted in public office immediately after bail. It said justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done.A bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih said it would not re-examine its verdict but would examine the limited aspect of apprehension that witnesses may feel in the case.In contrast to the convention of politicians quitting official positions after being arrested and chargesheeted - something that was followed across the political spectrum for decades - some high-profile politicians have held on to their positions despite having been incarcerated. The SC, which did not object to the departure from convention so far, now seems to be firming up a position against it.The court's remarks in Balaji's case follow its earlier order where it gave the chief of TMC youth wing bail on the condition that he would not hold any official position. Balaji, on the other hand, was re-inducted as minister three days after being released on bail following a 15-month stint in custody.""The present application is based on apprehension... The apprehension is that considering the seriousness of the allegations against the second respondent in the predicate offences, witnesses may not be in the frame of mind to depose against the second respondent who is now holding the position of a cabinet minister. This is the only aspect on which, prima facie, we are inclined to consider the application,"" the bench said in its order.Sensing the mood and prima facie opinion of the bench, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Balaji, urged the court to refrain from issuing notice in the case and assured that he would take instruction and brief the court on the next date of hearing.",Senthil Balaji was granted bail in a money laundering case linked to a cash-for- jobs scam.

NEW DELHI: Is the Election Commission powerless to disqualify a foreign national, who has got elected as a gram panchayat Mukhiya, despite unimpeachable evidence about his nationality?This question of law was raised by Bihar state election commission before the SC on Monday. A Nepalese citizen had written to the Nepal govt to cancel his citizenship. But prior to its cancellation, he contested and won the 'Mukhiya' election in a Bihar gram panchayat. Patna HC overturned the SEC's decision to disqualify him saying it was the Union govt which alone can decide citizenship and nationality of a person.The SEC challenged the HC order before the SC and a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan impleaded Union of India as a party and sought its response by Dec 9. The HC had ruled that SEC did not have the power to decide the disqualification of a candidate either before or after the elections, excluding an election dispute.As per the SEC appeal, one Biltu Ray aka Bilat Ray aka Bilat Prasad Yadav was a citizen of Nepal in 2006-07 and held a valid Indian passport from Oct 25, 1996, till Oct 24, 2006. He never applied for renewal of the passport after its expiry. In March 2016, he filed an application with Nepalese authorities seeking to relinquish his Nepalese citizenship.In Oct 2021, he filed his nomination for the post of Mukhiya of Bhaluaha gram panchayat without disclosing that he is a citizen of Nepal.

Supreme Court on Monday sought Election Commission 's response to a PIL which apprehended that many would be denied voting rights as ""an EVM can register a maximum of 660 votes per day"" even though the number of voters per booth has increased from 1,000 to 1,500.The petitioner had arrived at the '660' number based on his calculation that a voter would take at least a minute to cast her ballot and voting was typically held for 11 hours on the scheduled day.A bench of Chief Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked senior advocate Maninder Singh, who appeared for EC, to file an affidavit explaining how the commission viewed the issues raised by petitioner Indu Prakash Singh. It posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 27.Maninder Singh said before conducting an election, EC consults every political party and polls have been conducted smoothly without a single voter complaining that she was not able to vote. He said the efficiency of EVMs have been repeatedly questioned before the SC, which each time, after a detailed verification, has approved the machines. But the bench said, ""There is some confusion because of your 2019 circular increasing the voters per booth from 1,000 to 1,500.""The petitioner said voting took place on the scheduled day for 11 hours and claimed that even if ""the election officials inside a booth are super efficient"", a voter would still take one minute to get his/her identity checked, mark name in the electoral roll, apply indelible ink on finger, cast vote and verify VVPAT.Thus, a total of 660 voters can cast their vote in the 11-hour scheduled voting time, he said. The petition said the cap on voters per booth was revised upwards from 1,000 to 1,500. ""As of the 2019 general elections, the average number of electors per polling station was recorded at 877, a decrease from 898 in 2014. Given this data, it is essential to reconsider and lower the upper limit of 1,500 electors per polling booth back to 1,000,"" the petitioner said.""By increasing this limit, the EC has compromised the operational efficiency of polling stations, potentially leading to longer waiting times, overcrowding, and voter fatigue,"" he added.When only 660 electors can cast their vote in an EVM within the scheduled 11-hour period, fixing 1,500 voters per booth would result in many people not being able to cast their vote, leading to disenfranchisement, he claimed.","Supreme Court seeks Election Commission's response to a PIL.

Where India is concerned, I can state with confidence that the strategic convergences with the United States have only grown deeper with time. They have created a larger environment in which more collaborative possibilities can be explored,"" said the minister, speaking at the CII partnership summit.""Naturally, between two major economies, there will always be some give and take. When we look at economic or technology domains, the case for trusted and reliable partnerships have actually increased in recent years,"" he added.According to the minister, a lot of what lies ahead would be in fashioning terms of engagement that are perceived as mutually beneficial. ""And in that regard, the more that India can bring to the table, the stronger our appeal,"" he said.Without naming China, Jaishankar reiterated India's position that national security filters must be followed when it comes to economic decisions, including those of investment. ""This is the trend the world over and we would ignore it at our own peril,"" he said, adding the world is in an era of leveraging, if not of weaponization.While mentioning the US-China friction and the Ukraine conflict, the minister said that the Global South is also feeling the brunt of inflation, debt, currency shortages and trade volatility. ""In short, the world looks a tough place.

At times, currents of politics may seek to distance, or even disrupt. Obviously, challenges like terrorism cannot be overlooked.

""Regardless of the political leadership in the White House, the Indo-US relationship will continue to strengthen,"" Garcetti told TOI in an exclusive interview in Bodh Gaya.Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump 's upcoming visit to India, Garcetti said, ""Trump will come because India is hosting the Quad Leaders' Summit in 2025. So, you will have the President of the US, the PMs of Japan and Australia, together with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So that will happen in 2025. If the schedule holds, that means Trump will come in 2025.""Asked whether Trump's recent statements warning BRICS nations against dumping the dollar, as well as his threats of imposing a 100% tariff and denying access to the US economy, would affect US-India relations , Garcetti said, ""I can't speak to the new administration because it has not taken power yet.Right now, I still work for the current US president, President Joe Biden . I think that we have shown that the fewer barriers we have, the more jobs we create, the more trade we have. Even when Trump was president, trade increased despite some trade disputes.""On the topic of the ""great friendship"" between Modi and Trump, Garcetti said, ""Look, I think that President Biden has been the most pro-India president in American history. I think Modi has been the most pro-American Indian Prime Minister in history. Every president wants to do better than the last one and there's no doubt that Modi and President-elect Trump have a good friendship. But the US-India relationship doesn't start from the top. It starts from the bottom. Every Indian has a relative in America. We have so many students. The number one source of international students in America is now India. We have trade, scientists and cultural exchanges. Our leaders reflect the demands of our people who want close relations.""Garcetti also addressed concerns among Indian students regarding Trump's ""anti-immigrant"" rhetoric and ""America First"" policies, which might make the US less welcoming. ""Again, I can't speak to policies that haven't even started yet. What I will say is that we are very proud that Indians are the number one source of international students in the US. Our universities are better because of Indian students and many universities are working together. For example, recently Purdue University in the US and IIT-Hyderabad formed a partnership. We also have successful Biharis, like the CEO of the largest nuclear company, who was born in Bihar and is now in talks with the govt about helping produce nuclear power here. With students, I expect the trend to continue, so don't be scared,"" he said.","US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Monday that America and India need each other.

Midnight Drama Over VB-G RAM G Bill, Opposition Stage Overnight Protest, Sleep Outside Parliament

NEW DELHI: BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members and urged Speaker Om Birla for disciplinary action against them for ""continuously obstructing"" the House's proceedings when rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was piloting the G RAM G BillOfficial sources said Birla is examining the matter. The Speaker was critical of the excessive disruption by several MPs, some of whom reached the table of Lok Sabha officials in an attempt to disrupt proceedings, on Wednesday.Dubey named Hibi Eden, Dean Kuriakose, S Murasoli, K Gopinath, Sashikant Senthil, Shafi Parambil, S Venkateshan and Jothimani, all from different opposition parties, in his notice.In his letter to Birla, he accused them of continuously obstructing the smooth functioning of the House by creating obstructions for Chouhan and the officers assisting the House.""As such, this is misconduct in the presence of House, disobedience to the authority of Speaker, obstructing officers of the House in discharge of their duties which is clearly a breach of privileges of Members of Parliament collectively and the contempt of the House,"" he added.He urged Birla to take ""strict action"" against against the opposition MPs ""so that in future this kind of incidents do not re-occur"".When Chouhan was responding to the debate, opposition members rushed to the Well of the House, tore copies of the Bill and stood on tables to register their protest against the provisions of the rural job guarantee Bill, which will replace the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).The Speaker's office is also examining the opposition's notice for removal from office of Madras high court Judge GS Swaminathan and also the complaint filed against a TMC MP for vaping inside Lok Sabha even as e-cigarette is banned across the country.As the session came to an end, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju lauded this sitting of Parliament as a milestone in PM Narendra Modi's push for ""reform express"", highlighting the passage of some key legislations covering rural employment, insurance and nuclear energy.He also blamed the opposition for the absence of discussion on air pollution in Delhi-NCA, claiming that the govt was keen for it but Congress wanted to continue with loud protest against the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill and persuaded other opposition parties as well.Rijiju, however, termed the session as ""very productive"" as eight bills were passed after debates in both Houses. These legislations will ""speed up"" the 'reform express' flagged off by Modi to bring improvement in the everyday life of the common people. The reform express will continue, he added.""But the opposition's behaviour during the debate in Lok Sabha on Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill was unacceptable. Some of the opposition members even stood atop the desks of the table office and (Lok Sabha) secretary general. Some Congress members also conveyed that there was no need for a debate on pollution. That is why the issue could not be taken up for discussion,"" he said.In Lok Sabha, Birla noted that the House's productivity topped 111% and was marked by a marathon discussion of over 11.30 hours to commemorate 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.","BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members.

Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

BARUIPUR (WEST BENGAL): An FIR has been registered against BJP leader and National In-Charge of the party's IT Cell, Amit Malviya, at the Narendrapur Police Station under the Baruipur Police Station, alleging that his social media post threatened communal harmony and the sovereignty of India.According to the complaint received on Friday by Narendrapur Police Station, All India Trinamool Congress leader and State General Secretary and Spokesperson Tanmoy Ghosh accused Malviya of posting an ""incendiary statement"" on the social media X platform on December 19. The complaint references a specific post, claiming it amounted to ""formal instigation against communal harmony"" and posed a ""substantial threat"" to the country's sovereignty.The complainant further alleged that the post constituted a direct insult to West Bengal, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee . The letter urged the police to initiate strict legal action against the BJP leader under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and any other applicable laws.Police sources confirmed that the complaint had been received and acknowledged by Narendrapur Police Station.However, officials said no FIR has been registered to date and that the matter is under preliminary examination.Further action, officials said, will be taken after the complaint and the social media post in question are reviewed.In the X post against which the FIR was filed, Amit Malviya stated that the ongoing vandalism in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was a ""warning"". He noted that this is ""how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised."" In reference to incident, he stated that, ""It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying."" In the end, he said, ""Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away. ""The X post stated, "" Last night, Islamist mobs vandalised Chhayanaut Bhavan, a historic institution and a cornerstone of Bengali arts and culture in Dhaka. The pattern unfolding in Bangladesh is unmistakable: attacks on media houses, journalists, and cultural centres, carried out under Islamist pressure and intimidation. This is a warning. This is exactly how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised. It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying. Years of political patronage, erosion of institutions, and selective silence have pushed Bengal onto a dangerous path. If Mamata Banerjee's decrepit regime continues beyond 2026, the consequences for Bengal will be irreversible. Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away.""The development adds to the ongoing political tensions between the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the Bharatiya Janata Paty, with leaders from both sides frequently trading accusations over social media conduct and alleged attempts to disturb communal peace, as the West Bengal elections in 2026 approach.Further details awaited.

How time changes everything,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-time-changes-everything/articleshow/126077954.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I once encountered an incident in an interview given by Thiru Waleswaran, the late son of V O Chidambaram Pillai — one of India’s greatest freedom fighters. In the interview, Waleswaran spoke of a visit to a govt office where he was asked to pay a bribe. He wished to challenge it legally, but he did not. He could not afford even the court fee. The irony was piercing. A system demanding a bribe from the son of a man who had sacrificed everything for the freedom of that very system. Martyrs are tested not only by their enemies, but by time itself. Their intentions are questioned, their sacrifices measured anew. History, like a ceaseless river, carries within it blood and compassion, rage and reconciliation, heroism and humility. When we scoop a single moment from its waters, we see only a fragment. But when we step back and watch the river flow across generations, history begins to speak in a deeper, humbler voice. Another incident I came across belongs to that deeper current. On the morning of June 17, 1911, at Maniyachi railway station, Vanchinathan, a young Tamil revolutionary, shot and killed Robert Ashe, the British collector of Tirunelveli. Moments later, Vanchi took his own life. One man fell as a representative of imperial authority; the other died as an embodiment of fierce resistance. Ashe’s wife Mary returned to her country with her four children — two daughters and two sons. Empires receded, flags changed, and the fury of that morning slowly settled into the footnotes of history. More than a century passed. Then, quietly, history curved back on itself. While researching the life of V O Chidambaram Pillai and the upheaval in Tirunelveli following his arrest, historian A R Venkatachalapathy came across records of the Ashe murder trial. His research led him not only to documents, but to people — Robert Ashe’s descendants: a grandson named after him, a granddaughter and other members. During a meeting, they raised a toast in memory of both Ashe and Vanchinathan. Later, they wrote a letter to the family of Vanchinathan and sent it through Venkatachalapathy. It was not a letter of accusation. Nor was it an attempt to rewrite the past. It was a letter of reconciliation. “On this day of sad but proud remembrance,” they wrote, “we extend a message of reconciliation and friendship to the Vanchi family. Vanchi was an idealist political campaigner whose zeal for the freedom of his beloved India sent Robert to his early grave. Moments later, he took his own young life… All who act fervently in the political arena, both ruler and oppressed, risk making mortal mistakes. We who are fortunate enough to live on must forgive and live in peace together.” Across a hundred years, the descendants of the ruler and the rebel reached out — not to justify, but to understand. It is here that a Kural quietly enters the river of thought. Valluvar writes: EnnaIMun NillanMin Thevveer PalarEnnaI MunNindru KalNin dravar. (Kural 771) Foes! Do not oppose my chief. Those who did so before, now are entombed. At first glance, it sounds like a cry of martial pride — a warrior hailing an unconquerable leader. But as writer Jeyamohan has reflected, who could such a chief truly be? No human ruler remains undefeated. No ideology escapes erosion. Perhaps the chief Valluvar speaks of is not a king or a commander, but time itself. Time alone defeats all — the tyrant and the martyr, the victor and the vanquished. It buries rage, exposes arrogance, humbles power, and sometimes ripens forgiveness. And yet, some acts endure: the courage of Vanchinathan, the sacrifice of Chidambaram Pillai, and a letter written by the descendants of Robert Ashe.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

NEW DELHI: India ended the T20I series against South Africa on a high by winning the fifth and final match and sealing the five-match series 3-1 on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, India have managed to extend their unbeaten streak. They are now on a streak of 10 consecutive series wins (including major tournaments).With the 4th T20I in Lucknow being abandoned earlier because of heavy fog, everyone wanted to see a full game, and the players didn't disappoint at all.India put up a big total of 231 for 5 after South Africa won the toss and chose to bowl.The batting effort was led by Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya . Tilak played a steady and attacking knock, scoring 73 runs off 42 balls.Hardik provided the late surge with a quick 63 off just 25 balls, hitting five 4s and five 6s. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma also gave India a strong start at the top.Chasing 232, South Africa began well. Quinton de Kock was in fine form and attacked the Indian bowlers from the start. South Africa matched India’s Powerplay score and stayed in the hunt.When Dewald Brevis joined de Kock, the visitors picked up momentum. The pair played freely and took South Africa to 118 runs at the halfway mark, putting pressure back on the Indian side.At that point, the match seemed evenly balanced. That is when India captain Suryakumar Yadav turned to his most trusted bowler, Jasprit Bumrah . Bumrah made an immediate impact by dismissing de Kock with a sharp return catch. That wicket changed the game.South Africa suddenly lost their rhythm. From 120 for 1, they slipped to 135 for 5 in a short span.The middle order could not recover from the collapse. Varun Chakaravarthy added to South Africa’s problems with an impressive spell, picking up four wickets and breaking key partnerships.While Varun took the wickets, Bumrah’s spell stood out in a high-scoring match. He finished with excellent figures of 2 wickets for just 17 runs in his four overs, controlling the game when it mattered most.South Africa eventually finished on 201/8 in their 20 overs, falling 30 runs short of the target.With this victory, India won the match by 30 runs and closed the series 3-1.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying.

NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety of journalists and hold those responsible accountable.In New Delhi, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs said the situation in Bangladesh was “complex and evolving” and flagged continued attacks on minorities, media groups and intellectuals. “The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,” the panel said in a report presented in Parliament.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India remains concerned about extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, even as it continues engagement with the interim government and seeks to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments.Police in Bangladesh have launched a manhunt for Hadi’s attackers and announced a reward for information leading to their arrest, as authorities struggle to contain unrest that has raised fresh questions about law and order and minority safety in the country.","A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant. The killing comes amid a broader wave of violence across Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a 32-year-old student leader and key figure in last year's uprising.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126071248,imgsize-867574,width-400,resizemode-4/image-credit-xbjp4bengal.jpg"

'Letter drafted with BJP mindset': Why Congress should not ignore message of sacked Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/letter-drafted-with-bjp-mindset-why-congress-should-not-ignore-message-of-sacked-odisha-leader-mohammed-moquim/articleshow/126060393.cms,"Letter To Sonia Gandhi Costs Ex Odisha MLA Moquim Party Post As Congress Cites Anti Party Activities

“The party's presence is shrinking geographically, organisationally, and even emotionally.”

“The party is losing its legacy not because of external opponents but due to decisions taken within.”

""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation.”

“The booth workers, block presidents, district-level leaders, who are truly the backbone of the party, feel ""unseen and unheard"" and this ""alienation"" makes electoral conversions nearly impossible.”

“There has been a growing distance between the leadership and the grassroots workers. Despite being an MLA, I was unable to meet Shri Rahul Gandhi ji for almost three years"".

NEW DELHI: The Congress has once again crushed dissidence with an “iron hand.” The expulsion of Odisha leader and former MLA Mohammed Moquim, after he went public about a letter he had written to Sonia Gandhi against the party leadership, was a given. The fact that the Congress justified its action and accused Moquim of operating with “BJP mindset” and working for the “interests of the saffron party” was also not a surprise.We have seen the grand-old-party go through this drill many times in the last 11 years as its political fortunes declined across the states. Several Congress leaders, both at the national level and at the state level, have openly targeted the top leadership and faced action. We all remember the group of 23 Congress leaders (G-23) who had in 2020 written a letter to Sonia Gandhi demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party. While some of these dissidents were expelled, others voluntarily left the party but nothing changed in the way Congress functioned.This time, while the Congress may be perhaps right in questioning the intent of Mohammed Moquin, it would do well by not ignoring the message of the former MLA-turned-rebel by labelling him a BJP stooge. “Giving a letter to Sonia ji is acceptable, but releasing it to the press is not. This clearly indicates that he does not want to stay in the Congress,” Odisha Congress chief Bhakta Charan Das said justifying the party action.Ironically, Bhakta Charan Das was one of the targets of Moquim’s letter. The expelled MLA had questioned Das’s appointment as state party chief and his capability to deliver results in the state citing his past electoral performance. Moquim’s other targets were Rahul Gandhi and party chief Mallikarjun Kharge .So, what was Moquim’s communication? Here are some of the stinging statements that Moquim made in his letter:Well, a lot of what Moquim said in his letter have been raised before by many leaders who have parted ways with the grand old party in the past. Ironically, his remarks against the national leadership, especially on Rahul Gandhi’s inaccessibility and Kharge’s age, masked his pointed attacks on the party’s leadership in Odisha.Moquim highlighted the fact that the Congress had lost 6 consecutive elections in Odisha and expressed concern over the party's recent electoral performance in the Nuapada by-elections, where BJP defeated Congress by a huge margin despite the fact that Nuapada fell under the constituency of the present state Congress chief.“Under the leadership of Das, in the Nuapada by-election, his own parliamentary segment, the Congress lost by an unprecedented margin of nearly 83,000 votes. When a leader cannot secure trust in his own constituency, workers naturally lose confidence in his leadership and raise concerns in his ability to guide the party in Odisha,” the former MLA wrote in his letter.He also pointed out the failures of the Bhakta Charan Das’s predecessor Sarat Pattanayak: “Having lost six consecutive Lok Sabha elections, sometimes forfeiting his deposit, his appointment weakened morale at all levels. Under his leadership, the 2024 elections witnessed the lowest vote share in our history — just 13%. He again lost his own election, once more forfeiting his deposit,” he wrote questioning the party’s decision to appoint state chiefs who could not secure their own victories.Odisha, like many other states, has seen the Congress gradually decline to oblivion. The last time Congress won in Odisha was in 1995. Since then, it has been a story of decline. In 2000 it won 26 seats, 38 in 2004, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2014. In 2019, the Congress tally in Odisha was reduced to single-digit 9 seats and could win 14 in 2024. The grand-old-party that ruled Odisha for several years, first ceded space to regional party Biju Janata Dal and then to the BJP - a story which has defined its existence in the last 10 years. The Congress has remained on the sidelines - doing little to revive the party’s lost glory in the state.The Congress in Odisha at present is perhaps in no position to challenge the ruling BJP. However, if the grand-old-party makes a sincere effort, it could make forays into the support base of the BJD, which took an unprecedented beating in the 2024 assembly elections and now depends heavily on an aging Naveen Patnaik for its revival. Unfortunately, there seems to be no Congress roadmap for revival. The state leadership could do better than holding protests over the court order on National Herald case if they want to pose any real challenge to the BJP or the BJD.The story of Congress decline is similar in several other states where the grand-old-party was first relegated to the sidelines by regional parties and then decimated to oblivion by the BJP. In Bihar, West Bengal, the Congress is struggling to stay relevant in electoral politics while the BJP has successfully made deep inroads.While Moquim is dumped, the Congress should not dump his message. The points raised by him merits attention - if the Congress hopes to revive.","Mohammed Moquim, a former Odisha MLA, was expelled from the Congress. He wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi criticising the leadership of the party. The letter also criticised the Odisha Congress chief, Bhakta Charan Das. The party has been in decline since 1995.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126077395,imgsize-1220033,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Parliament debate on SIR

What is SIR

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Archana Patnaik on Friday said the draft electoral roll, after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), for the state now includesvoters, comprising 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men.She said that prior to the SIR, the poll-bound state had around 6.41 crore registered voters, and the exercise led to the deletion ofnames from the rolls.According to Patnaik, the deletions included 26.94 lakh voters who had died, 66.44 lakh voters who had permanently shifted or migrated, andduplicate entries where individuals were found to be registered in more than one place.She added that among those marked as migrated,persons were found not residing at their registered addresses after three rounds of door-to-door verification conducted across the state.The SIR in the DMK-ruled state was conducted amid vehement opposition by chief minister MK Stalin , whose party filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the major roll-revision exercise in the southern state.“To prevent this anti-democratic move, we convened an all-party meeting and passed a resolution condemning the SIR. The Election Commission’s decision to carry out a full revision of the electoral roll just months before the election is part of a well-planned strategy to delete legitimate voters,” CM Stalin said while criticising the Election Commission's electoral roll sanitisation exercise.Also read: Nearly 74 lakh names deleted from Gujarat rolls; EC opens window for objections CM Stalin added that the same tactic was used earlier in Bihar, where lakhs of genuine voters were allegedly ""removed from the list"".He also pointed out that opposition to this controversial process had first emerged from Tamil Nadu, after which the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who also happens to be the Lok Sabha leader of opposition, raised strong objections.“Even after a legal case was filed, the Election Commission did not give a satisfactory explanation,” CM Stalin said.Taking aim at AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, CM Stalin accused him of “playing a double game” and being “afraid of the Election Commission due to his ties with the BJP.”He added that while migrant workers from Bihar had found livelihood and respect in Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minister was “playing political drama in Bihar for electoral gain.”Nearly 74 lakh voters have been removed from Gujarat’s draft electoral rolls following the completion of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, reducing the state’s total electorate to 4.34 crore from 5.08 crore earlier, officials said on Friday.The Election Commission published the draft electoral rolls on Friday, after which 73.73 lakh names were omitted as part of the roll-cleaning exercise, Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer Hareet Shukla said.“Before the publication of the draft rolls, Gujarat had 5,08,43,436 registered voters. After the revision, the number stands at 4,34,70,109,” Shukla said.According to the CEO’s office, the deletions included 18,07,278 deceased voters, 9,69,662 absent voters, 40,25,553 voters who had permanently migrated, 3,81,470 duplicate entries, and 1,89,364 names removed under other categories.On Tuesday, the Election Commission published a draft list of deleted voters after the SIR of the electoral rolls in West Bengal. The list features voters whose names were included in the state’s electoral rolls in 2025 but were deleted from the draft rolls of 2026.This came after the first phase of the SIR exercise ended on December 11. The second phase, which began after December 16, will involve the filing of claims and objections.The notice phase, which includes issuance, hearings, verification and decisions on enumeration forms, as well as disposal of claims and objections, will be carried out concurrently by Electoral Registration Officers (EROs).The SIR issue was also debated and discussed at length during the Winter Session of the parliament, with the Leader of the Rajya Sabha JP Nadda and other key minister in the NDA government urging the opposition parties to come together to back the SIR of the electoral roll, while pointing out how West Bengal has seen a massive spike in its electorate from 4.8 crore to 7.6 crore since the last SIR in 2002.Nadda, citing ECI data during the debate in Rajya Sabha on electoral reforms, said the minimum increase in voters' list of the 9 West Bengal districts bordering Bangladesh was 70 per cent since 2002, while the maximum had crossed 100 per cent.He shared that Uttar Dinajpur has witnessed the highest spike in electors at 105.5 per cent, Malda at 94.8 per cent, Murshidabad at 87.6 per cent, 24 Parganas at 83.5 per cent and Jalpaiguri at 82.3 per cent.The Election Commission of India (ECI) conducts a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls to ensure the accuracy and completeness of voter lists ahead of major elections. The exercise involves a detailed door-to-door verification to identify and remove duplicate, shifted or deceased entries while enrolling new and first-time voters.Carried out under the Representation of the People Act, 1950, the SIR aims to maintain the integrity of the electoral rolls by updating demographic details and correcting inaccuracies.During the revision, booth-level officers visit households, verify electors’ details, and facilitate claims and objections. The process is a key part of the Commission’s voter roll management, ensuring that every eligible citizen is included and the rolls reflect the most current and authentic data before elections."," Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Archana Patnaik on Friday said the draft electoral roll, after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), for the state now includes 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men.

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, a landmark law that opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence.The Rajya Sabha approved the bill by voice vote, defeating opposition demands to refer it to a standing committee. The Lok Sabha passed it a day earlier. Once the President gives assent, the bill becomes law.""It marks a transformational moment for our technology landscape,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , linking the bill to India’s clean energy ambitions and global leadership in AI and green manufacturing.PM Modi added in his post on X: ""My gratitude to MPs who have supported its passage. From safely powering AI to enabling green manufacturing, it delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country and the world. It also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth. This is the ideal time to invest, innovate and build in India!""The SHANTI Bill aims to supercharge India’s clean energy transition. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion ($214 billion), as Bloomberg reported.“This (nuclear energy) will be the most reliable, steady 24x7 source of energy, unlike some other renewable sources,” said Jitendra Singh, minister of state for Atomic Energy, defending the bill in Parliament.At a time when power demand is exploding-driven by industrial growth, data centers, and urban expansion-the bill aims to ensure a firm, carbon-free power source, unlike solar or wind, which are intermittent.This isn’t just about inviting private capital. The bill overhauls the entire nuclear governance architecture, combining safety, licensing, regulation, liability, and dispute resolution into one statute.Indian private firms are now permitted to construct, possess, and manage civil nuclear facilities. Foreign entities can also get involved through partnerships or joint ventures.The Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act of 2010 are both being repealed, making way for a single, updated regulatory structure.Operators' liability is capped (for instance, Rs 3,000 crore for large reactors), and the government can establish a Nuclear Liability Fund to cover any claims that exceed this limit. Suppliers are generally protected from liability, unless their contracts specify otherwise.The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is now a statutory body, gaining legal independence as a safety regulator. This grants it the power to inspect, halt, or even shut down operations.A dual authorization system is being implemented. Nuclear plants will require both an operating license and a safety authorization. Every single action, from building to waste management, will need official approval.""The standard operating procedure explicitly states: 'safety first, then production,'"" Singh noted, emphasizing that India's safety protocols remain firmly grounded in the Nehru-era approach.Plants will now need two clearances-a licence to operate and a safety authorisation. Every activity-from construction to waste storage-requires approval.“The SOP in place clearly mentions: ‘safety first, second production’,” said Singh, asserting that India’s safety standards are still rooted in the Nehru-era framework.The bill is not just about clean energy-it’s about unlocking stalled mega-projects and repositioning India geopolitically.India’s 2010 liability law scared off global suppliers. Companies like GE, Westinghouse, and EDF shelved projects worth billions because of Section 17(b) of the CLND Act, which allowed victims to sue suppliers in case of a nuclear accident.That’s now gone.SHANTI removes this statutory risk, aligning India with global conventions like the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and signalling to Washington, Paris, and Tokyo that India is open for business.Meanwhile, opposition MPs raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha, questioning the Centre’s decision to allow private players into the nuclear sector, warning it could affect the country’s sovereignty.“We are seeing profits being privatized, and risks being socialized,” warned Manoj Kumar Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, referring to taxpayer-backed safety nets for private players.“The bill dismantles the liability framework established after the Bhopal gas tragedy,” said IUML’s Haris Beeran, adding, “Posterity will judge us very badly”.“The government comes up with an acronym first and then a policy,” said Congress’ Jairam Ramesh, accusing the BJP of rewriting history and ignoring contributions made before 2014.“It’s a milestone. We are now a first-line nation, not followers,” Jitendra Singh told Rajya Sabha, adding India’s global role in energy and climate has changed significantly.Participating in the debate, Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose described the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill as not just flawed but ""fundamentally dangerous.""""This Bill brings neither Shanti nor security... we are not debating whether India should pursue nuclear energy, India has always pursued nuclear energy responsibly for decades..."" she said.""But as a country, are we now prepared to abdicate our sovereign responsibility, gamble with public safety and place one of the most sensitive sectors of the nation at the mercy of crony capitalism and government-friendly oligarchs as well as foreign pressure?""""This Bill is not reform, it is recklessness. This Bill is not for the public, it's for profit,"" she added.DMK MP P Wilson said the Bill is a ""nuclear bomb which threatens the country's peace and security"". He also demanded that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee of Parliament.AAP MP Sandeep Pathak questioned BJP-led Centre and pointed out that the saffron party had opposed India-US civil nuclear deal due to foreign involvement.""Do you accept the opposition at that time was political not ideological? If it was ideological, do you accept that you have changed your ideology?"" he said.""Is it for money? Or do you think they will bring technology? We are importing a foreign model without importing their regulatory spine,"" he added.India is betting on nuclear while the world is rediscovering it as a climate-friendly baseload power source.Global nuclear capacity could potentially exceed 860 GW by 2050, a projection fueled by AI, data centers, and the push for clean technology, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley Research in August.Nations such as China, South Korea, and Japan are actively increasing their nuclear power capabilities. The US and EU are also showing interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), a trend the SHANTI Bill supports.India's plans are in step with this global shift:The Department of Atomic Energy reports that India's nuclear energy budget has seen a significant increase, nearly tripling from Rs 13,879 crore in 2014 to Rs 37,483 crore in 2025.The safety-liability issue remains a point of contention.Critics argue that SHANTI weakens accountability standards.No strict criminal liability for suppliers.Operators face capped compensation.Victims have limited recourse.G Sundarrajan, an anti-nuclear activist, told the AP that the bill ""takes away essential safeguards,"" making it ""nearly impossible"" for radiation victims to seek legal redress.""This also provides little recourse for any Indian citizen to claim damages from nuclear companies,"" he added.Union minister Singh, however, countered those concerns, stating, ""Wide consultations were held... with industry leaders, scientific experts, startups, and ministries.""""We took more than a year, and the bill was framed with safety and global benchmarks in mind.""SHANTI's strategic vision hinges on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These compact, factory-assembled reactors, each under 300 MW, are designed to power industrial hubs or remote areas.Consider these possibilities:The legislation's framework permits private ownership, licensing, and safety approvals for these installations, providing a competitive advantage in clean energy for heavy industries.According to Bloomberg, L&T is already exploring SMR technology.The geopolitical implications are significant.The SHANTI Bill extends beyond energy; it's also a tool of foreign policy.By adhering to global standards for liability and safety, India is:Reviving the Westinghouse project in Andhra Pradesh, which had previously stalled.Reengaging in agreements with EDF, GE, and Rosatom.Strengthening strategic relationships with the United States, France, and Japan.This also positions India as a climate-conscious global leader, particularly in the lead-up to G20 follow-up meetings and COP summits.How quickly are licenses granted? What are the specific safety requirements? Who will be the first to apply – Tata? Adani?Who's going to take on the nuclear risk? And are the premiums even realistic?How does the funding work? What's the process for payouts?Will it actually enforce the rules, or will it cave to political influence?Places like Kudankulam have seen protests. Could land acquisition and health concerns spark fresh conflicts?","Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025. The bill opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126080027,imgsize-651630,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year “power-sharing arrangement” within the state government.Facing repeated questions from the Opposition over his tenure on the last day of the Legislative Assembly session in Belagavi, Siddaramaiah said there was no such agreement in place and made it clear that he would remain the CM until the party high command decides otherwise.“First, the people must bless us. Then the legislators elect the leader in the Legislative Party meeting, and after that, the high command decides. That is all I have said. Even now, I am the Chief Minister, and I will remain the Chief Minister until the high command decides otherwise,” he said.Reacting to Siddaramaiah’s remarks, BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, R Ashoka, questioned the claim, saying, “You were elected for five years by the Legislative Party. What about 2.5 years?”Siddaramaiah responded, “I never said anything about two and a half years. There is no such agreement as two and half years.”Earlier this week, the CM reiterated that he would complete his full term. “We will complete the full term and return to power in 2028...I’m the CM till the high command says,” Siddaramaiah said.Speculation over a possible change in leadership, with Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar taking over the CM seat in January gained momentum over the past few days. The Congress later sought to put the rumours to rest after Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar met for breakfast at each other’s residences and addressed the media together to project party unity.DK Shivakumar also dismissed speculation surrounding a reported dinner meeting. “Who said? There was no dinner meeting or anything. I had gone for a dinner to my former DCC president to pay respect, they contributed a lot to Karnataka, Belgavi. So to honor them, I went along with my friends. There is no other politics,” he said.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year “power-sharing arrangement” within the state government.

Opposition's midnight protest outside Parliament

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, ending the 19-day Parliament Winter Session, which was marked by a series of moments that went viral, capturing the chaos, confrontation and occasional absurdity that unfolded inside Parliament.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla announced the adjournment for an indefinite period, noting a productivity of 111 percent of the house during the session.Over 15 sittings, several key Bills were passed, including legislation opening up the civil nuclear sector to private companies.The session was dominated by the passage of the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, which replaces MNREGA and guarantees 125 days of employment for rural households, amid loud Opposition protests.Debates also covered election reforms and 150 years of ‘Vande Mataram,’ reflecting both the legislative and dramatic moments of the session.Controversy arose after BJP MP Anurag Thakur accused a Trinamool Congress MP of vaping inside the Lok Sabha. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya later identified the lawmaker as TMC leader Kirti Azad.Malviya wrote on X, “For people like him, rules and laws hold no meaning. Hiding an e-cigarette in his palm inside the House is unacceptable.Smoking may not be illegal, but using it in Parliament is.” He also called on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to comment on the alleged misconduct.Earlier, Thakur had submitted a written complaint to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking action against the TMC MP for using an e-cigarette, though he did not name the lawmaker at the time.Former Union minister and Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a puppy into Parliament on the first day of the session. She said she had rescued it after seeing it near the site of a road accident while on her way to the House. Concerned for its safety, she carried the puppy in her vehicle.Taking a jibe at the BJP, Chowdhury said, ""The real ones (dogs) who bite are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue and a topic of discussion. Does the government have nothing else to do? I sent the dog home and told them to keep it at home... We don't talk about those who sit in Parliament and bite us every day,"" she said.When asked about a possible privilege motion, she barked at reporters. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding that serious issues like pollution-related deaths, suicides of booth-level officers, and labour laws were being ignored while the focus remained on her dog.Unruly scenes erupted during the passage of the VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaced the 20-year-old MGNREGA. Opposition MPs, mostly from the Congress, stormed the well of the House, shouted slogans, and tore copies of the Bill after their demand to refer it to a parliamentary committee was rejected.The disruptions continued as the government pushed the legislation through, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Rural Development Minister Shivraj Chouhan criticised the Opposition, calling the tearing of pages and MPs climbing onto tables a “murder of Bapu’s ideals.”""The behaviour of the opposition in the Lok Sabha today, including members of the Congress and the INDIA Alliance, has undermined the integrity of our democracy. Parliamentary decorum has been thoroughly disregarded. Democracy has been transformed into mobocracy. We listened carefully to the opposition. I said I would answer each question, but I should be heard. But pages were torn, and they got onto the tables. Isn't it a murder of Bapu's (Mahatma Gandhi) ideals?""Tempers flared during a debate on the Special Intensive Revision when Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged Home Minister Amit Shah to an open debate over allegations of “vote chori.”Rahul insisted on answers about immunity granted to election commissioners and alleged the presence of 19 lakh fake voters. “""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.He added, “Let us have a debate on my press conference. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to have a debate.”Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes and that he would decide the sequence of his speech.Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes. “I will decide the sequence of my speech. Parliament will not work like this,” he said. He asked Rahul to have patience and said he would answer every question.Rahul called Shah’s response “defensive” and “scared.”Opposition protests over the G RAM G Bill culminated in dramatic walkouts, as members accused the government of rushing the legislation through without proper debate and scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that supported crores of households.Despite repeated warnings from the Chair, Opposition MPs continued shouting slogans before walking out of the House in protest. They condemned the Bill for undermining rural livelihoods and bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. The walkouts underscored the tense atmosphere in the House, which persisted until the legislation was ultimately passed.Amid the acrimony in Parliament, a lighter moment unfolded during Question Hour when Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sought a meeting with Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to discuss landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway and road projects in her Wayanad constituency.Gadkari responded promptly, saying no appointment was necessary and invited her to his chamber. During their discussion, Priyanka noted the recurring landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway, pointing out that low retaining walls were failing to prevent slope collapses. She also raised concerns about six road projects passing through Kerala, including some under the Centre’s purview.Gadkari assured her that he would look into the issues. At one point, he humorously remarked, referencing her brother Rahul Gandhi, “Bhai ka kaam kar diya, behen ka nahin karunga toh aap bolenge ki nahi kiya” (“You’ll complain that I addressed your brother’s concerns but not yours”), drawing laughter from Priyanka and others present.Eyewitnesses also noted a quirky culinary moment: Gadkari offered Priyanka a rice dish he had prepared after watching YouTube videos, which Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was seen tasting while chatting with the minister.The protest over the Bill spilled beyond Parliament hours, with Opposition parties staging a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night.As Rajya Sabha cleared the legislation after midnight by a voice vote, following its earlier approval in the Lok Sabha, Opposition MPs renewed demands for the Bill’s withdrawal and referral to a parliamentary panel, but the government rejected their appeals.Trinamool Congress leader Sagarika Ghose accused the Centre of “bulldozing” the legislation, calling it an insult to India’s poor and alleging that MPs were given barely five hours’ notice without a proper debate.","Lok Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, ending the 19-day Parliament Winter Session. The session was dominated by the passage of the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill. Opposition MPs stormed the well of the House, shouted slogans, and tore copies of the Bill.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126077411,imgsize-874239,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-39.jpg"

A shrinking global water reserve



Groundwater: India’s invisible lifeline



States/cities staring at ‘Day Zero’



The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones:

Northwest India: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh — where groundwater recharge exists but indiscriminate withdrawal, driven largely by agriculture, has led to over-extraction.

Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat — where arid conditions limit natural recharge. Southern peninsular India: including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where hard, crystalline aquifers have low storage capacity.

NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

State and UT-wise classification shows:

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

The invisible crisis beneath our feet



Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours. The weather agency said fog conditions are likely to persist for the next two to three days, raising concerns over reduced visibility, travel delays and road safety.Airport authorities said flight operations were impacted through the day, with 79 departures cancelled, including two international flights, and 73 arrivals cancelled, including two international services. Passengers have been advised to check with their respective airlines for the latest updates before heading to the airport.In Delhi, hazardous air conditions continued, with thick smog blanketing several areas, including Anand Vihar.The Commission for Air Quality Management activated all measures under GRAP Stage IV across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the Air Quality Index at 442 in Ghazipur, 409 in ITO and 447 in Palam, placing these areas in the ‘severe’ category. The city’s overall AQI stood at 330 at 7.47 am, while earlier readings showed levels as high as 358 during the morning hours. At around 8 am, Delhi’s overall AQI was recorded at 387, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.Authorities advised residents, particularly children, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments, to limit outdoor exposure as pollution continued to pose serious health risks.Dense fog also disrupted aviation operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, with flights being operated under CAT III conditions, leading to multiple delays. Delhi International Airport said low visibility was affecting flight schedules.“Dense fog is impacting flight schedules, and operations are currently under CAT III conditions. Our on-ground teams are working in close coordination with all stakeholders to assist passengers and provide necessary support across all terminals.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

SC upholds man's will cutting off daughter for marrying 'outsider',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-upholds-mans-will-cutting-off-daughter-for-marrying-outsider/articleshow/126064884.cms,"Says Testator’s Wish Assumes Pre-Eminence

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla Joseph was disinherited by her father N S Sreedharan for marrying outside the community.

He also sought to know whether lung elasticity among citizens of Delhi-NCR has drastically reduced to almost 50% compared to people living in cities with good AQI levels.The BJP Rajya Sabha MP further asked whether the govt has any “solution to save millions of residents of Delhi/NCR from growing deadly diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, emphysema, reduced lung function and continuously declining lung elasticity”.The ministry in its reply said dedicated training modules have been developed in the area of air pollution for programme managers, medical officers and nurses, nodal officers, sentinel sites, frontline workers such as ASHA, vulnerable groups including women and children, and occupationally exposed groups like traffic police and municipal workers.It said, “Information, education and communication (IEC) materials have been developed targeting air pollution related illnesses in both English, Hindi and also regional languages.“The National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) has also developed customized IEC materials targeting various vulnerable groups such as school children, women, occupational vulnerable groups like municipality workers, etc.”","The government has told Parliament that there is “no conclusive data’ establishing a “direct correlation’ between higher air quality index (AQI) levels and lung diseases.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday moved the Delhi High Court against a trial court order that refused to take cognisance of its prosecution complaint against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald money laundering case.The move follows a Delhi court order passed on Tuesday. The court declined to take cognisance of the ED’s prosecution complaint, which is equal to a police charge sheet.In a 117-page order, Special Judge Vishal Gogne held that the ED probe was “impermissible in law” as it was not based on a first information report (FIR). An FIR is required to begin an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The judge ruled that an investigation and the related prosecution complaint for money laundering cannot stand without an FIR.The court, however, allowed the ED to continue its investigation based on an FIR registered by the Delhi Police’s economic offences wing on October 3. The agency brought this FIR to the court’s notice during the hearing.The court also rejected the Gandhis’ request for a copy of the police FIR.It said they were not entitled to it at this stage of the investigation.The judge also examined how the case began. He noted that “in the present origin of the allegations, a public person, namely Subramanian Swamy, instituted the complaint under Section 200 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). He is not a person authorised to investigate the offence mentioned in the schedule (Section 420 of IPC)”.Based on these findings, the court said, “It is now premature and imprudent for the court to decide the submissions made by ED as well as the proposed accused in relation to the merits of the allegations.”The case relates to the acquisition of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which published the now-defunct National Herald newspaper.",The Enforcement Directorate has moved the Delhi High Court against a trial court order.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its probe into the ‘donkey’ or ‘dunki’ route found Thursday that a key operator based in Haryana allegedly collected property papers from aspirants as security to guarantee payments for arranging illegal travel to the US through Mexico.‘Dunki’ route is a network used to send Indians illegally to the United States. The searches spread across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi were focused on what officials described as “second and third layer persons involved in the chain” of the donkey route syndicate.“Chat with other involved persons and other incriminating evidence regarding dunkey business has been found,” officials associated with the probe told news agency ANI.""From premises of a key donkey player in Haryana, records and documents related to donkey business has been found. It has been revealed that he used to keep property documents of candidates as surety for payment of amount for sending USA through Mexico donkey route,"" said the officials, adding ""some incriminating documents and mobile have also been recovered from the premises of other persons covered under search operations.During the operation, the agency seized assets worth Rs 19.13 crore from the premises of a travel agent based in Delhi. Cash amounting to Rs 4.62 crore, along with 313 kg of silver and 6 kg of gold bullion was seized.The latest search operations covered premises linked to Richi Travels in Jalandhar, Tarun Khosla in Delhi and Balwan Sharma in Panipat.In a related development, the ED recently attached assets worth Rs 5.41 crore belonging to agents Shubham Sharma, Jagjit Singh and Surmukh Singh- individuals accused of generating illegal proceeds by facilitating unlawful migration through the donkey route. The properties include agricultural land, residential and commercial properties, as well as bank accounts held in their names and those of their family members.The searches were initiated based on specific intelligence inputs in a case that took shape after multiple FIRs were registered in connection with the deportation of 330 Indian nationals by US authorities in February 2025. The individuals were flown back to India on military cargo planes after it was found that they had entered the US illegally.The ED said that “these agents and their associates used to cheat gullible people by luring them under the pretext of sending them to the USA legally and charged hefty amounts for this.”The agency added that the victims were instead taken through risky routes via several South American countries before being pushed across the US-Mexico border illegally. “Throughout the way, people were tortured, extorted for even more money and made to commit illegal acts. These ‘agents’ and their associates generated proceeds of crime by cheating various persons on false pretexts and obtaining large sums from them. ”","‘Dunki’ route is a network used to send Indians illegally to the United States.

Pilgrimage to YouTube: 'Pasayadan' enters global consciousness



From Pandharpur's pilgrimage trails to a former US president's 2025 playlist, a 13th-century Marathi prayer for universal brotherhood has leapt across time and tide to find a place in Barack Obama's annual music recommendations.Between international pop, hip-hop, and Afrobeats, Obama's playlist also features 'Pasayadan', a contemplative modern rendition by New York-born and Tamil Nadu-raised vocalist Ganavya, available on YouTube.Composed by Sant Dnyaneshwar, 'Pasayadan' is traditionally sung at the conclusion of the wari, the annual Varkari pilgrimage.Unlike many devotional compositions that emphasise personal salvation, the abhang casts its net wide, praying for the well-being of all beings, say cultural experts. Drawing from jazz, ambient textures, and South Asian classical traditions, Ganavya's rendition features on her 2025 album 'Nilam', co-produced by Nils Frahm at Berlin's Funkhaus studio. Viewed widely after Obama's nod, the track's YouTube music video, directed by Vali Chandrasekaran and featuring dancer David Adrian Freeland Jr, mirrors its contemplative spirit.In her 'Nilam' press statement and interviews around the release, Ganavya explained that 'Pasayadan' ""is an abhang from the pilgrimage tradition...one of the last prayers we'd sing... where the young saint prays for the sun to rise in all cold hearts..."" Describing it as a meditation on wisdom, compassion, and mutual sanctuary amid suffering, she had added that 'Nilam's' central theme is 'doing what we need to do to keep carrying on'.Marathi literary experts say the early lines of the abhang establish its moral vision: 'Je khalanchi vyankati sando, taya satkarmi rati vadho' - a plea for cruelty to dissolve and wisdom to grow. Its most enduring line, 'Bhootan paraspere pado, maitra jivanche', expresses a wish that all beings be bound in friendship. Another verse, 'Duritanche timir javo, vishva swadharma surye paaho', calls for darkness of suffering & ignorance to be dispelled and for world to be illumined by ethical light.For Marathi scholar Aparna Bedekar, who has a doctorate on sant sahitya, 'Pasayadan' represents the philosophical culmination of the Dnyaneshwari, the foundational text of the Bhagwat tradition. ""Pasayadan has emerged as its supreme prayer,"" she says. ""Through this prayer, the Varkari pilgrimage in Maharashtra came to embrace people across 18 communities, dissolving distinctions of caste, sect, modes of worship, and social hierarchy. "" Saints such as Gora Kumbhar, Sena Nhavi, Savata Mali, Narhari Sonar - and even Kanho Patra, a courtesan - became part of the pilgrimage, she notes, finding spiritual upliftment within its fold.Written in the spoken Marathi of the people, abhangs travelled not through texts alone but through memory, footfall, and voice. Satish Joglekar, author of 'Window to Ancient India', describes 'Pasayadan' as a prayer that transcends 'dharma, creed, and time', surpassing even the Upanishadic idea of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' because it urges individuals to actively become a refuge for others.The message resonates in the present day. ""The world is going through war and strife, so it is deeply relevant,"" says Prasad Kambli, director of acclaimed play 'Sangeet Dev Bababhali', which features abhangs by 17th-century poet-saint Sant Tukaram. 'Pasayadan' is about universal brotherhood. For Dnyaneshwar, this was the crux of Bhagavad Gita. What was articulated eight centuries ago is being heard again today in a different form, he adds.According to Siddha Yoga Path website, 'Pasayadan' is offered as a gift of divine grace meant for 'upliftment and benefit of all people', reflecting Dnyaneshwar's wish that compassion and joy reach every human life. The abhang, meaning 'unbroken', lies at the heart of Varkari tradition, which rejected ritual hierarchy and Sanskrit exclusivity in favour of lived ethics and communal devotion, say cultural experts.In modern times, the prayer entered public consciousness through Hridaynath Mangeshkar's composition, Now, Ganavya's version propels it into global spotlight.","'Pasayadan' is a 13th-century Marathi prayer for universal brotherhood.

Court will always lean towards animals who suffer silently: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-will-always-lean-towards-animals-who-suffer-silently-sc/articleshow/126084410.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the centuries-old human-animal conflict invariably leading to constricting the wild habitat, the Supreme Court on Friday said the court would always lean towards the animals who suffer silently when their migration paths are impeded by commercial tourism ventures.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said this while hearing petitions by various wildlife resorts which have been asked to vacate after the Tamil Nadu govt notified elephant corridors in Sigur Plateau in the Nilgiris.The high court on Sep 12 had approved the recommendation of an SC-appointed committee which had declared that the land purchased by private parties on the elephant corridors in Sigur Plateau was illegal and that the constructions raised on these lands need to be dismantled. The high court order came on petitions by owners of private forest lodges/resorts which had challenged the findings of the expert committee headed by former judge K Venkataraman.The committee was set up by the SC after the district collector of Nilgiris had informed the apex court that there was a total of over 800 constructions, including 39 resorts and 390 houses, inside Sigur elephant corridor.The authorities sent demolition notices to 35 resorts last year.Senior advocates Salman Khurshid and Shoeb Alam argued that owners of these resorts/forest lodges had bought the properties much before the elephant corridors had been notified and that they should be allowed to continue with their eco-friendly business with a rider that they must not expand their business ventures.The bench said, ""The finding of the committee is clear - all of you are there for commercial purposes and on the elephant corridor.

Green funds not charity but constitutional obligation : SC



NEW DELHI: In an important decision to nudge the corporate sector to play an active role to protect the environment, Supreme Court on Friday brought the issues of ecology and environment within corporate social responsibility and passed a slew of directions to protect the Great Indian Bustard, which is on the verge of extinction and faces threat from operation of non-renewable power generators in Rajasthan and Gujarat.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar asked the non-renewable power generators operating in priority and non-priority areas in Rajasthan and Gujarat to remember they share the environment with the GIB and must undertake their activities as if they are guests in its abode.Elaborating on the role of the private sector in the issue of environment, the bench said the corporate definition of social responsibility must inherently include environmental responsibility. “Companies cannot assert to be socially responsible while ignoring equal claims of the environment and other beings of the ecosystem. The Constitution, under Article 51A(g), imposes a fundamental duty on every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment. ... A corporation, as a legal person and a key organ of society, shares this fundamental duty. CSR funds are the tangible expression of this duty. Consequently, allocating funds for the protection of environment is not a voluntary act of charity but a fulfilment of a constitutional obligation,” Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.SC said CSR provision codifies the principle that corporate profit is not solely the private property of shareholders, but is partly owed to society that enables its generation. The bench accepted the recommendation of a court-appointed committee for preservation of GIB despite opposition from power generators. It approved revised priority conservation areas of 14,013 sq km in Rajasthan and 740 sq km in Gujarat. It also approved panel recommendation on blanket ban on the installation of solar projects over 2MW capacity or the laying of overhead transmission lines. The court said survival of GIB is a shared cultural responsibility, as the bird represents not just a species but the unique natural heritage and resilience of the arid landscapes.",The Great Indian Bustard is on the verge of extinction and faces threat from non-renewable power generators in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

The criminal revision petition is likely to be listed for hearing next week.ED contended that Special Judge Vishal Gogne overlooked critical evidence of money laundering while holding that cognizance of the agency's complaint in the case was ""impermissible in law"" since it was based on a private complaint filed by BJP's Subramanian Swamy and not on any FIR for an offence listed in the schedule to Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The trial court observed that despite receiving Swamy's complaint and consequent summoning order in 2014, CBI had refrained from registering an FIR. ""However, ED went ahead with recording an ECIR relating to money laundering on June 30, 2021, when no FIR (with CBI or any other law enforcement agency) existed in relation to the scheduled offence,"" the court added.The agency has accused Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, along with late Congress functionaries Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes, as well as Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, and a private company, Young Indian Private Ltd.(YIL), in which Sonia and Rahul are majority shareholders, of conspiracy and money laundering.ED alleged that they acquired properties worth Rs 2,000 crore belonging to Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which publishes National Herald newspaper. In 2010, YIL acquired AJL's debts from Congress for Rs 50 lakh, thereby taking control of AJL's properties.In 2014, ED began probing the financial transactions among Congress, AJL, and YIL, and accused Sonia, Rahul, and other Congress functionaries of conspiring to usurp AJL's assets.(With agency inputs)","ED alleges that Special Judge Vishal Gogne overlooked critical evidence of money laundering.

NEW DELHI: Rancour and blame game inside Parliament made way for conviviality and cordiality at a customary post-parliamentary session get-together of govt functionaries, including PM Narendra Modi , and opposition MPs at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla's chamber over tea on Friday.Congress and other opposition parties, which had skipped the meeting in a few previous sessions to convey their protest with happenings inside Parliament, were present in full force in an informal setting marked by Modi's wit and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's relaxed and easy presence.Sources said Priyanka made polite enquiries from Modi about his foreign trip, setting the tone for a rare convivial setting involving govt & opposition members, some of whom nudged for a longer session as the 15-day sitting of winter session, which was adjourned sine die, was one of the shortest ever.With her brother Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition in LS being in Germany, first-time MP Priyanka was the main Congress voice in the meeting. Her confidence but easy manner was a change from Rahul's more aggressive and confrontational approach, a source said.Modi, sources said, asked opposition MPs about the session and praised RSP MP NK Premachandran, a Congress ally, for his diligence in parliamentary business.Several others too echoed the positive view of the seasoned parliamentarian. The PM made some light comments, evoking smiles from everyone.Sources said that Priyanka spoke about the health benefits that she got using a herb from her constituency Wayanad in Kerala.Modi used the Tamil greeting 'Vanakkam' for Manickam Tagore, and Priyanka quipped that she too has learnt a line in the language which means 'Vote for Congress', eliciting smiles from everyone, sources said. There was all-round laughter when a vocal opposition MP's pitch for a longer session drew a quip from govt side that a short sitting might have given his throat some rest.Birla, sources said, emphasised the opportunity given to so many of the members from different parties to speak on bills and different issues despite the relatively short session. This was acknowledged by members at the meeting. Lok Sabha's productivity was 111% in this session.Defence minister Rajnath Singh was among the ministers present at the meeting, which was also attended by Kumari Selja, Mohammad Jawed, from Congress, SP's Dharmendra Yadav, DMK's A Raja and NCP(SP)'s Supriya Sule, besides several BJP allies.After returning last night from his three-nation tour, Modi joined LS as Vande Mataram was played to mark the session's end moments after it convened at 11am. This Parliament session was headlined by the passage of VB-G RAM G bill to replace the UPA-era MGNREGA amid fierce opposition protest. The session marked by high productivity ended with govt and opposition benches trading punches.As Birla read out his valedictory statement in LS, opposition raised slogans of ""Mahatma Gandhi ki jai"" to highlight their protest against removal of Gandhi's name from the rural job guarantee scheme. A debate listed on air pollution, which was jointly moved by Priyanka, DMK's Kanimozhi, did not take place due to what a govt functionary described as ""bad atmosphere"" inside the House.","Congress and other opposition parties, which had skipped the meeting in a few previous sessions to convey their protest with happenings inside Parliament, were present in full force.

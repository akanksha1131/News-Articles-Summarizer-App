Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw fact-checks Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg on 2024 polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-fact-checks-meta-chief-mark-zuckerberg-on-2024-polls/articleshow/117217466.cms,"Zuck touted Covid link to incumbents losing across world

NEW DELHI: IT and information & broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Monday ""fact-checked"" Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg's recent statement that incumbent govts in several countries, including India, had lost elections in the post-Covid period.Saying Zuckerberg's claim was ""factually incorrect"", Vaishnaw posted on X, ""@Meta, it's disappointing to see misinformation from Mr Zuckerberg himself. Let's uphold facts and credibility.""Vaishnaw's ""fact-check"" comes a week after Zuckerberg announced that Meta was disbanding its US fact-checking programme.Appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast , Zuckerberg had said 2024 was the big election year around the world and in a lot of countries like India, the incumbents lost the polls.""There is some sort of global phenomenon, whether it was inflation because of the economic policies to deal with Covid or just how the govts dealt with Covid, seems to have this effect that is global, not just the US, but like a very broad decrease in trust, at least in the set incumbents and maybe, in sort of these democratic institutions overall,"" the Facebook founder had said.The minister pointed out that the Modi govt won a third term in the elections conducted in 2024. ""As the world's largest democracy, India conducted the 2024 elections with more than 640 million voters. People of India reaffirmed their trust in NDA led by PM Narendra Modi's leadership.""He said the win in elections reaffirmed the faith of citizens in the govt which rolled out food and vaccine programmes to tide over the Covid period. ""From free food for 800 million, 2.2 billion free vaccines, and aid to nations worldwide during Covid, to leading India as the fastest-growing major economy, PM Modi's decisive third-term victory is a testament to good governance and public trust.""The censure of Zuckerberg's statement comes as the company scrapped its US fact-checking programme on Jan 7 and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity, bowing to criticism from conservatives as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time.""We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It's time to get back to our roots around free expression,"" Zuckerberg had said in a video.In place of a formal fact-checking programme to address dubious claims posted on Meta's platforms, Zuckerberg instead plans to implement a system of ""community notes"" similar to that used on Elon Musk-owned social media platform X.","IT and information & broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Monday ""fact- checked"" Mark Zuckerberg's recent statement that incumbent govts in several countries, including India, had lost elections in the post-Covid period.

Army chief backs women officers after Lt General criticised their performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-chief-backs-women-officers-after-lt-general-criticised-their-performance/articleshow/117217331.cms,"Found women officers mature & considerate, says Army chief

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing push for ""gender-neutrality"" in the overwhelming male-dominated environs of the armed forces, General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday said women officers were performing exceedingly well, disagreeing with the ""perception"" of a serving Lt General who strongly criticised them for not measuring up to the requisite standards as commanding officers (COs).The Army chief said the number of women in the armed forces will keep increasing as ""gender-neutrality"" progressively gains ground in society as well as the military. At present, the over 11-lakh strong Army has 1,732 women officers (the number goes up to 8,000 if doctors, nurses and some others are included) and 310 military police jawans.By 2025-end, the number of women officers will go up to 2,037. There are already 115 women COs, with 18 more ready to join them.The Army is also looking at a ""12 times increase"" in induction of women in other ranks by 2032.""As far as the Army is concerned, we want strong women officers... maybe 'Kaali Mata Ka Roop'... It means it has to be a gender-neutral approach,"" Gen Dwivedi said.A couple of months ago, however, the then 17 Corps commander Lt Gen Rajeev Puri had strongly criticised women COs for ""poor inter-personal relations"", ""misplaced sense of entitlement"" and ""lack of empathy"" for troops under their command, with an ""exaggerated tendency to complain"" to senior commanders, in a letter written to higher authorities, as was then reported by TOI.On this, Gen Dwivedi said, ""The letter shouldn't have leaked. A court of inquiry has been ordered into it. It's his perception (and) he has all the right to give out that perception and comment. It was an internal communication.""The Army chief said it was important to consider the context in which women officers were made COs based on SC's directions. With the entire process being accelerated, women officers were not trained and groomed for the challenging role of COs, unlike their male counterparts who do the 'junior command', staff college and other adjunct courses as well as the requisite appointments as young officers.""There are 16 women officers currently doing staff college. There are women officers now in the regiment of artillery, pilots in Army aviation. When I was commanding Northern Command, I found women officers to be mature, considerate, and up and about,"" the Army chief said.Women officers have only from 2023 onwards begun to command units in air defence, signals, ordnance, engineers, intelligence, service corps and the like, though they are still not allowed in the main 'fighting arms' of infantry, armoured corps and mechanised infantry of the Army.","General Upendra Dwivedi said women officers were performing exceedingly well.

'Raises doubts': HC on Delhi government's delay in tabling CAG's excise policy report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raises-doubts-hc-on-delhi-governments-delay-in-tabling-cags-excise-policy-report/articleshow/117217224.cms,"Govt in HC: Petitioners using court as instrument to play

political games

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday criticised AAP government for not placing key CAG reports , including one on the capital's scrapped liquor policy, before the assembly for discussion, and called this ""unfortunate.""Saying that the delay ""raises doubts on your bona fides,"" Justice Sachin Datta told the government, ""You should have promptly forwarded the reports to Speaker. You have dragged your feet to avoid having a discussion. See the number of dates you held onto the report, and the time taken to send them to LG and then forwarding it to Speaker.""However, HC didn't pass an interim direction. It said calling an assembly session was the Speaker's ""prerogative"". It told the petitioners-a group of BJP MLAs-whether a court order could be issued, especially with polls just days away.Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta and other BJP MLAs have moved court seeking a direction to Delhi Speaker to call a sitting of the assembly for the purpose of tabling the CAG reports.The senior lawyer appearing for govt objected to the ""political"" nature of the petition and alleged the LG office made the reports public and shared it with newspapers. In the post-lunch session, the govt's counsel highlighted that BJP leaders had already held a press conference citing some of the oral remarks made in the morning proceedings and accused the petitioners of using the court as an ""instrument to play political games.""But Justice Datta made it clear the court couldn't ""react"" to the allegation as it is not concerned with politics and posted the matter for Jan 16. During the hearing, the senior lawyer representing the petitioners, said the court can direct the Speaker to convene a sitting of the assembly for tabling the reports as delay in placing these reports for discussion is itself a ""substantive illegality"" and a violation of the constitutional mandate - an issue warranting judicial intervention.""Assembly was adjourned sine die on Dec 4 (2024) by the Speaker. But that does not cause the death of the session. There was no prorogation,"" argued the petitioners' counsel. Last week, the assembly secretariat informed the court that no useful purpose would be served in tabling the CAG reports as its tenure ends next month. It added that no judicial order could be passed to the Speaker in matters of internal functioning of the legislative assembly, submitting that CAG reports can be examined by the successor PAC of the legislature, which would be elected by the next assembly post-Delhi elections.

NEW DELHI: A mechanical engineer from Tamil Nadu's Tiruchirappalli, Vigneshwar Muruganandham always aspired to a life of luxury. While his father was a retired government employee, the unemployed 30-year-old was desperate for a high-paying job. However, he ended up on the wrong side of the law as he allegedly became a member of a Chinese cybercrime syndicate in Cambodia.Last week, as reported by TOI, he was arrested for allegedly duping a Japanese professor from a premier institute in Hauz Khas by 'digitally arresting' her for six hours.Muruganandham's journey, which he revealed during interrogation, started with the promise of easy money. The Chinese contacts he met online offered him a lucrative opportunity to work with their 'company' in Cambodia. They sent him tickets, and he arrived in the country in April 2024, armed with an array of Indian bank accounts they had asked him to open.At first, everything seemed legitimate. Muruganandham was put up in a hotel, and his new employers used the bank accounts he provided. But as the days passed, he began to realise that something was off. His employers wouldn't tell him how much money was being transacted through the accounts, and he started to feel like a small cog in a larger machine.As he settled into his new routine, he discovered he was not alone.There were more than 20 Chinese nationals working alongside him, all of whom were involved in a massive cybercrime operation targeting India and its neighbouring countries, he told police officials.They called themselves a 'company', and everyone was trained to introduce themselves as 'employees' if asked about it.The operation was sophisticated, with people from India and other countries brought in to work on computer-related tasks and telecommunications. The camp was monitored closely, with workers divided according to their expertise. Muruganandham's role was to arrange and manage Indian bank accounts, a task he performed diligently for more than a month.But as time passed, he began to feel uneasy.He realised there were other groups doing the same work, and they were easily accessible on Telegram channels. So, after spending a month at the camp, he decided to leave the 'company' and strike out on his own.Back in India, Muruganandham allegedly started supplying bank accounts to other similar cyber scammers based in Cambodia, earning a handsome commission in the process. It was a lucrative business, and he made a huge amount of money before the law caught up with him.Earliar in Jan, Muruganandham was among five suspects arrested by southwest Delhi police.DCP (southwest) Surendra Chaudhary said on Monday that Muruganandham was working with Chinese nationals who run a cyber camp in Cambodia and orchestrated cybercrimes overseas.","Vigneshwar Muruganandham, 30, was arrested for allegedly duping a Japanese professor by 'digitally arresting' her for six hours.

PM's presence signal to those against

: Omar

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: The unusual bonhomie stood out in the numbing cold of Sonamarg. J&K CM Omar Abdullah lauded PM Narendra Modi saying he enjoyed high trust among people for keeping his word to hold free and fair elections in the state even as he urged the PM to make good his commitment to restore the Union Territory to statehood .Modi reciprocated the sentiment by terming J&K the ""crown of India"", promising a new future for the youth of the UT and reaffirming that he would fulfil his statehood promise ""at the appropriate time"". He said, ""Yeh Modi hai, wada karta hai toh nibhata hai. Har kaam ka ek samay hai, aur sahi samay pe sahi kaam bhi hone wale hain (This is Modi who keeps his promises. And right things are going to happen at the right time).""The occasion was the opening of the 6.4km all-weather Sonamarg tunnel , an engineering feat accomplished in a challenging terrain in the face of threats from Pakistan-backed terrorists who killed seven workers in Oct. The tunnel will considerably reduce travel time between Srinagar and Leh.But as the speakers spoke of shrinking distance between hearts and between Delhi and Srinagar, many could also see a shrinking gap between the two political adversaries.Omar's praise for PM Modi on Monday contrasted sharply with his recent remarks on INDIA bloc. He had said there was no INDIA meeting and hence there was no clarity about ""its leadership, agenda or existence"".Omar had said they should ""wind up the alliance"" in case it was just for the Parliament elections.Omar, who spoke first, set the tone by complimenting Modi on his interest in J&K as evidenced by his second visit in a fortnight, completion of infrastructure projects which - enabled by improved security situation - has brought in hordes of tourists. ""Remote areas such as Machil, Gurez, Karnah and Keran are seeing benefits in terms of development and tourism , with an increasing number of tourists visiting these regions,"" he said.The CM emphasised that while the foundation for Sonamarg tunnel was laid in 2012, it took Modi and Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari to complete it.Omar said that the PM's presence was a signal to those who didn't want development of the nation, and peace and democracy in J&K. ""They will always face defeat and we will send them defeated from here. We will not allow any damage to democracy, peace and development of J&K,"" the CM said in a forthright attack on terrorists and their backers in Pakistan.On elections, he stressed that there was zero interference by the administration and there was no repolling in any booth. Coming from someone who had fought elections while expressing apprehension of rigging of polls, this was a remarkable praise, the warmth of which was palpable even in minus 9 degree celsius.The applause for his appeal for statehood could not have escaped the PM's attention. He reiterated ""Modi ki guarantee"" but was firm that Centre would go by its own timetable.Modi said Kashmir's development, like of all other parts, was crucial for India's goal of becoming a developed country - remarks which appeared to go beyond the oft-stated resolve of Kashmir being an integral part of India.""Kashmir is India's crown, and the dream of Viksit Bharat can be achieved only when it is bedecked with jewels. Jammu and Kashmir of the 21st century is scripting a new chapter of development,"" he said.""The region is regaining its identity as 'Paradise on Earth', leaving behind the difficult days of the past. Today, people are going to Lal Chowk to have ice-cream and there is hustle and bustle at night. My artist friends from Kashmir have made Polo View Market the new habitat centre. In Srinagar, people go to cinema halls with their children and watch movies. No govt can do so many things that change the situation,"" Modi said, adding that a few months ago, an international marathon was held for the first time in Srinagar. He said Omar too participated in it and the video was widely circulated on social media.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah lauded PM Narendra Modi for keeping his word to hold free and fair elections in the state.

During the meeting, India reiterated its commitment to ensuring a crime-free border and stressed on its ""expectation that all earlier understandings will be implemented""The MEA pointed out India's adherence to protocols and agreements regarding border security measures, including fencing, as agreed upon by the two governments of neighbouring nations and the respective border forces, the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB).India also restated its commitment to maintaining a crime-free border, addressing challenges such as cross-border smuggling , criminal activities, and trafficking. Key measures like barbed wire fencing , border lighting, technical installations, and cattle fences were highlighted as crucial for securing the border.The diplomatic engagement follows Bangladesh summoning Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma a day earlier to discuss a cooperative strategy for tackling border crime.After the meeting, Verma reaffirmed the understanding between the BSF and BGB on border security measures. ""We expect this understanding will be implemented, ensuring a cooperative approach to combating crimes along the border,"" Verma said.However, Bangladesh's home affairs adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury attributed border tensions to ""unequal agreements"" signed during a previous government’s tenure. ""These deals have caused multiple complications along the Bangladesh-India border,"" Chowdhury said.Tensions have soared recently, particularly after objections from the BGB last week when the BSF attempted to install single-row barbed wire fencing at Sukdevpur in Malda's Baishnabnagar.

"Army chief rules out any troop cut along LAC, trust deficit & a 'degree of standoff' persists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-chief-rules-out-any-troop-cut-along-lac-trust-deficit-a-degree-of-standoff-persists/articleshow/117213009.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will not reduce the number of its troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control with China anytime soon, General Upendra Dwivedi said on Monday, asserting there is still “a degree of standoff” persisting between the rival armies and the two countries need to rebuild trust to de-escalate overall tensions.The Army chief also slammed Pakistan for continuing to be the “epicenter of terrorism orchestrating” cross-border violence in J&K, noting that 60% of terrorists killed in the state last year were of Pakistani-origin and 80% of the active terrorists are also from the same country.Speaking ahead of the Army Day on Wednesday, Gen Dwivedi described the current situation along the 3,488-km LAC with China as “stable but sensitive”, with thousands of rival troops and heavy weapon systems still ranged against each other for almost five years now.India has “adequate strategic patience” to resolve the military confrontation with China, he said, adding that the troop deployments along the LAC were “balanced and robust”, and “well-poised” to tackle any contingency.The Army chief also made it clear the existing ground situation is not ripe for any kind of troop cut during the ongoing winter, and the decision on the summer deployment will be based on the outcome of further negotiations with China.Asked whether India had agreed to give patrolling rights to Chinese troops in sensitive areas like Yangtse in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh, which had seen a clash between the rival troops in Dec 2022, Gen Dwivedi said all corps commanders have been delegated powers to resolve “minor frictions” related to patrolling and grazing issues so that they do not become “big issues” later.After troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders, India wants China to move ahead towards de-escalation and then de-induction of its over 50,000 forward deployed troops there.Since April 2020, when the People’s Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh, Gen Dwivedi said both sides have “doctored” the terrain, carried out constructions, made troop deployments and resorted to military stockings. Consequently, there is still “a degree of standoff” in place, he said.“The trust between the countries has to have a new definition. Therefore, there is a requirement for us to sit together and come to a broader understanding as to how we want to calm down the situation and restore the trust,” the Army chief said. The Army will await “guidance” on how to move forward from the next round of diplomatic and special representatives-level talks, he added.Indian troops, of course, cannot patrol in the “buffer zones” established earlier at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area in eastern Ladakh, varying from 3-km to 10-km, which largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.Gen Dwivedi, however, said, “There is nothing called a buffer zone…Where you feel that the nature or the degree of violence can be high and the fuse is short, you create some distances. So, when we carried out these negotiations over a period, at some places we declared a temporary moratorium.”“It means that both sides will remain back and will not go to the common areas because we still feel that if we meet at those places, the violence level may go high,” he added.",India will not reduce the number of its troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control with China anytime soon. General Upendra Dwivedi said there is still “a degree of standoff” persisting between the rival armies. The Army chief also slammed Pakistan for continuing to be the “epicenter of terrorism orchestrating” cross-border violence in J&K.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117213010,imgsize-534596,width-400,resizemode-4/117213010.jpg"

The Z-Morh tunnel, constructed at Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region. The construction commenced in May 2015 and reached completion in the previous year. The tunnel's initial opening took place in February 2024.

This infrastructure holds strategic importance for national defence requirements in Ladakh whilst establishing reliable connectivity between the Union Territory and the rest of India.

Located at 8,650 feet elevation, this two-lane tunnel features an additional 7.5-metre-wide emergency escape passage running parallel to the main structure.

The tunnel facilitates uninterrupted travel between Gagangir and Sonamarg, particularly benefiting summer travel to Ladakh.

This 2-lane road tunnel is being built under the mountain glacier Thajiwas Glacier between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district of Kashmir ensuring all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg boosting tourism. The strategic location of the Sonamarg tunnel will help in bypassing the major avalanche zones of NH-1 in the hung area which will ensure the safety of commuters.

This project features a third lane on the approach road to optimize traffic management by enabling the seamless movement of slow-moving vehicles while allowing faster-moving traffic to bypass without obstruction, thereby mitigating congestion and preventing traffic bottlenecks previously caused by heavy or slow-moving vehicles.

Working in conjunction with the Zojila tunnel currently under construction, this infrastructure will provide continuous access for both civilian and military vehicles to the Baltal and Ladakh areas.

The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), overseeing the project, confirmed the tunnel's advanced technological features providing continuous updates and connectivity. This modern infrastructure aims to enhance travel efficiency and establish improved road connectivity standards.

Together with the Zojila Tunnel, scheduled for completion by 2028, the project will decrease the route distance from 49 km to 43 km and increase vehicle speeds from 30 km/hr to 70 km/hr, ensuring continuous NH-1 connectivity between Srinagar and Ladakh. Officials indicate this improved access will strengthen defence logistics and promote economic and socio-cultural development across Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir that will make the Sonamarg tourist resort accessible throughout the year.Along with the PM, Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and chief minister Omar Abdullah was also present there at the event.Earlier today, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell chief Amit Malaviya shared a video on X and said that the Modi government is empowering Jammu & Kashmir.","The Z-Morh tunnel, constructed at Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region.

PRAYAGRAJ: More than 1.7 crore devotees immersed themselves in the bone-chilling waters of Sangam as Maha Kumbh 2025 began Monday with the sacred bath on Paush Purnima , turning the frigid confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mystical Saraswati in Prayagraj into a sanctuary of warmth, spirituality and cultural heritage.Amid chants, meditation, and prayers, the spiritual fervour was palpable. Rose petals rained down on pilgrims from helicopters, enhancing the divine atmosphere as many continued towards the Triveni Sangam for their holy bath even after sundown.PM Narendra Modi lauded Maha Kumbh as the breathing example of India’s spiritual legacy and a celebration of faith and harmony. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath described it as a symbol of India’s cultural unity in diversity.The ceremonial bath, which marked the 45-day event’s formal beginning, started at dawn and continued until dusk, with chants of “Har Har Gange” filling the air.With the temperatures plummeting to 10° Celsius, the foggy morning did not deter the faithful. They marched in unending queues to the 10,000-acre mela area, driven by devotion and the unique alignment of Paush Purnima followed by Makar Sankranti — a rarity that has amplified the huge influx of pilgrims.Though Kumbh Mela is a duodecennial event, this year’s is considered particularly auspicious as it aligns with a celestial event that occurs only once every 144 years. Over 85 lakh had already taken the holy dip in the days leading up to Monday.A larger crowd is expected on Makar Sankranti (Tuesday), when the Amrit Snan of akharas will take place.Security was tight, with 50,000 personnel ensuring safety as devotees flowed to the 41 ghats spread over 12km. ADG (Prayagraj) Bhanu Bhaskar said: “The first snan of Paush Purnima passed off peacefully.” Pilgrims from Bihar, Haryana, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and many other states joined the throng, their spirits unshaken by the cold.At the riverbank, scenes of deep faith unfolded — a couple stood waist-deep in water, fingers entwined, while a woman offered water to the rising sun. Nearby, an ascetic stood immersed in the river, eyes closed in reverence, as children played around him. The event brought together spiritual seekers and religious leaders.International visitors added to the diversity. South Korean YouTubers captured the vibrant spectacle, while Japanese tourists explored its spiritual essence with guides. Devotees from Europe, Russia, and America also participated, enthralled by the festival’s unity and faith.The Kalpvasis, known for their austere spiritual discipline, began their 30-day retreat on Paush Purnima. Their vows and prayers aimed at personal spiritual growth and the welfare of humanity added a profound dimension to Maha Kumbh’s sanctity.","More than 1.7 crore devotees immersed themselves in the bone-chilling waters of Sangam as Maha Kumbh 2025 began Monday.

HYDERABAD: Indian professionals are facing the heat in the wake of a raging debate over H-1B visa reforms in the US. With President-elect Donald Trump's administration expected to introduce stricter immigration policies , several professionals have already been hit by job offer withdrawals, visa delays and warnings of potential layoffs.TOI spoke to eight professionals in the US and in Hyderabad, and at least three had their job offers abruptly revoked due to ""visa-related concerns"". Hyderabad-based software engineer V Puvvada (name changed) is one such professional. Hired by a US tech giant in Dec, she was preparing to move to San Francisco when her offer was revoked. She had, meanwhile, quit her current job.""I was offered the job in Dec 2024 and since I had a written confirmation, I resigned from my current job,"" said the 28-year-old.The company cited ""changing visa dynamics"" as the reason for withdrawing the offer. ""I feel cheated. Why offer a role when you're not sure about sponsoring the visa? They later said that they will issue my offer letter again when the whole discussion is settled and there is a concrete decision after Donald Trump assumes office. But how long can I wait?"" Vaishnavi said.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, over 72% of the 380,000 H1B visas issued in 2023 went to Indians, most of whom work in STEM fields like data science, AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. These professionals earn an average salary of $118,000 (about Rs 1.01 crore) annually.However, Indian professionals in the US are staring at an increasingly challenging environment as Trump's administration is expected to ""reform"" the H1B programme by increasing salary thresholds and costs for employers, aiming to prioritise American workers. There's also a growing backlash from MAGA supporters, who have often targeted the H1B visa, claiming it undermines American jobs and wages.The fear of unemployment is affecting those waiting for visa renewals. Samaira Haji (name changed), a cybersecurity consultant in Los Angeles, is facing delays in her H1B visa sponsorship.""Initially, the company promised to expedite the process (of sponsoring the H1B). But now they claim they are ‘waiting for clarity' on the potential visa reforms. The wait is agonising,"" she said.Saniya, who moved from Nagpur to US in 2022 for her master's degree, is unsure of her future. ""I was told they would register me for the H1B lottery in March 2025. But they haven't even initiated the preliminary stages of the process. Does it mean they are going to file for my H1B later, or are they going to just fire me if there is any major reform?"" she wondered.A woman from Telangana, who recently secured a position as a data analyst after an extended job search, now faces a new challenge as her company expresses uncertainty about sponsoring her visa.""Now that I have finally secured a position as a data analyst, the uncertainty around the H1B visa has come to haunt me. I can't even think of facing the trauma of unemployment again,"" she said, preferring to remain anonymous.Similarly, a software developer from Gujarat working in California, is feeling anxious despite holding a secure visa. His company recently announced workforce reductions, adding to his worries.""The management hasn't stated categorically if these layoffs are linked to visa issues, but the timing is suspicious,"" he said, choosing to remain anonymous. ""If we lose our job, we have to find another within 60 days to be able to continue staying here.""With unemployment at record levels and increasing uncertainties for Indian immigrants, he said finding a new job with H1B sponsorship within such a short period would be difficult. ""It is terrifying to think that I could lose my job and my legal status in the US any moment,"" he said.A senior immigration lawyer based in Georgia, speaking on condition of anonymity, elaborated on the broader implications. ""Employers are hesitant to commit to international hires because the rules are in flux. They fear investing resources in sponsorships that might later face rejection or scrutiny. Unfortunately, it's the employees who have to bear the brunt of this uncertainty,"" the lawyer said.","Indian professionals are facing the heat in the wake of a raging debate over H-1B visa reforms in the US.

On Monday, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced the timelines for over a dozen major projects, including highways, tunnels and ropeways, worth around Rs 1 lakh crore.Addressing a public gathering at Sonamarg, Modi said J&K is becoming a hub of tunnels, high-bridges and ropeways, with some of the world's highest tunnels and rail-road bridges being constructed in the UT. He said the Chenab Bridge is an engineering marvel and the trial run of a passenger train was recently conducted.On major connectivity projects, the PM said ropeway projects for Shankaracharya temple, Shivkhori and Baltal-Amarnath will be taken up. He added that projects with a cumulative cost of more than Rs 42,000 crore are underway in J&K, including four national highways and two ring roads. More than 14 tunnels are being constructed, making the UT ""one of the most connected regions in the country"", Modi said.In his address, Gadkari said India will become more prosperous only when there is further improvement in infrastructure. ""Industries, tourism and business can flourish only when we improve water, power, transport and communication. Our govt has put a huge focus on infrastructure development to push growth and generate employment,"" he said.On the under-construction 14-km-long Zojila tunnel , Gadkari said this would reduce the travel time from Srinagar to Leh by around three and a half hours, and there will be all- season connectivity between the two cities. He added that the two major Ring Road projects for Jammu and Sringar will be completed in the next one and a half years.","Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced the timelines for over a dozen major projects, including highways, tunnels and ropeways.

India's market cap was a little over $5.7 trillion at its peak on Sept 27, 2024. On Monday, it closed at $4.8 trillion.Investor sentiment on Dalal Street was affected by a weak US market closing on Friday night due to a strong US jobs data earlier in the day that further dimmed chances of aggressive rate cuts in the coming months in the world's largest economy. The day's selloff shaved off 1,049 points from the sensex that closed at 76,330 points, an over 7-month closing low level.""The global markets witnessed a significant sell-off, prompting a similar response in domestic markets due to strong US payroll data suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025,"" said Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services. ""This has strengthened the dollar, driven up bond yields, and made emerging markets less attractive. Recent GDP downgrades and slowing earnings amidst higher valuations are weighing heavily on (domestic) market sentiment.""On Monday, midcap and smallcap stocks witnessed even stronger selloff than blue chips. The combined effect led to a total loss to investors' wealth worth about Rs 12.6 lakh crore with BSE's market cap now at Rs 417 lakh crore. The day's selling was led by foreign funds that clocked a net outflow of nearly Rs 4,900 crore while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 8,067 crore.A spiking crude oil prices - after the US President expanded the ban on oil from Russian - also impacted investor sentiment on Dalal Street as the move further weakened the rupee and could eventually lead to rise in inflation. ""Rising crude oil prices would raise concerns of a spike in domestic inflation, which could further delay any rate cut hopes from RBI in the near to medium term,"" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities.In Monday's market, of the 30 sensex stocks, 26 ended in the red, BSE data showed. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Zomato contributed the most to the day's slide. Higher closings in TCS, Axis Bank, HUL and IndusInd Bank cushioned the fall, but only marginally.

They must purchase EPR certificates from authorised scrapping facilities to prove their compliance.They will also need to create awareness for consumers and have schemes for buy back, and register their activities on a centralised portal to be managed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Arguing that the husband earned more than Rs 2 lakh every month and possessed three luxury vehicles, she demanded Rs 75,000 per month in maintenance.The husband opposed this demand and submitted that he was already paying her Rs 25,000. She also had two huge plots worth Rs 3 crore in her name, besides an income of her own, while his take-home income was Rs 75,000. Moreover, their sons are adults, and they too could earn and look after their mother, he argued. The husband cited section 20(1)(d) of the Act, which allows maintenance for children, but not for an adult son because section 125 of CrPC puts a bar on it.In Feb 2023, the metropolitan magistrate passed an interim order directing the man to pay Rs 28,000 per month as maintenance to his wife. Additionally, the court granted a monthly maintenance of Rs 7,000 to each of his sons, saying although both of them were adults, they were studying and their education expenses were being borne by the mother alone.The husband challenged the order, asserting that the metropolitan court did not take into consideration the evidence that his wife was earning and his two sons were adults, before directing payment of maintenance.However, additional sessions Judge M P Purohit said it was merely an interim order and the stage of evidence before the trial court was pending. Holding that there was no irregularity or impropriety in the impugned order, the ASJ said no interference was required at this stage, and rejected the appeal.","A sessions court in Ahmedabad upheld an interim order by a metropolitan court directing a man to pay maintenance to his two adult sons.

However, if compared with the June 30, 2010 gazette notification on the same, nothing seems to have changed in the appointment process of vice chancellors (VCs) of higher education institutions.The bone of contention has been the states' claim that the new regulations will give chancellors (governors) greater control over VC selection. While Kerala described the draft regulations as ""an overreach by the central govt, rendering states powerless in the higher education sector,"" TN chief minister M K Stalin announced plans to legally challenge the governor's authority over VC appointments. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had alleged that the UGC draft regulations, 2025, give state governors extensive control over vice-chancellor appointments and allow non-academics to hold these posts and termed it a ""direct attack on federalism and state rights"".In response, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan Monday attacked the Congress, accusing it of ""selling lies"" about the draft recruitment norms rolled out by the UGC and said the practice of governors appointing university VCs has been going on even before Independence.As per the 2010 regulations the search committee would comprise of ""a nominee of the visitor (President in case of central universities)/ chancellor (governor in case of state university), who should be the chairperson of the committee; a nominee of the chairman, UGC; a nominee of the syndicate/ executive council/ board of management of the university."" It further said that ""the visitor/ chancellor shall appoint the VC out of the panel of names recommended by the search committee.""The same has been retained in the proposed regulations of 2025 without any changes. As far as chancellor's role as the head of state university, as per the ""Report of the Education Commission (1964-66)"" also popularly known as ""Kothari Commission"" and as well as the recommendations from report of the committee of inter university board, both are of the view that appointment of VC's should be made by the chancellor in ""his individual judgment and not by the state govt.""Stating that the Congress which is unwilling to support youth education and national progress, is trying to confuse and mislead the youth, and fostering unrest, Pradhan in a pointed rebuttal said: ""Whether it is UGC Regulations 2010, 2018 or the current UGC Regulations of 2025, it is clear in all that the chancellor/ visitor appoints the vice chancellor....,"" and ""The selection committee structure of UGC Regulations 2025 is actually the format of UGC regulations 2010.

Sources in BSF however told TOI that construction of the fence was started based on earlier approvals from BGB, duly ratified by Bangladesh govt, in line with the procedure agreed to by the two sides at the institutional level.Such construction of fence is taken up by BSF only after it submits a proposal relating to the work to BGB, followed by joint inspection and finally, ratification by the Bangladesh govt and recording of this concurrence in the joint record of discussions (JRDs). ""JRDs had okayed single-row fencing of the two stretches within 150 sq yards of the border, one in Malda and the other at Dakshin Dinajpur. But when we embarked on the actual construction, BGB raised objections, alleging that the necessary approvals had not been taken,"" shared a senior BSF officer.Sources told TOI the central point made during flag meetings that followed at various levels, is that the JRDs must be redone as the earlier ones were ratified prior to the regime change. A senior officer said this demand marks a departure from the continuity principle followed in bilateral arrangements between two sovereign nations, irrespective of any change in their political dispensations.During the DG-level talks , BSF is hoping to find an amicable resolution to this imbroglio. Until then, status quo is likely to be maintained at the two stretches, which form part of the total 90-95km length that was found feasible for erection of single-row fence.Meanwhile, there are parallel tensions with BGB at around a dozen other border points, not related to construction of single row fence.
